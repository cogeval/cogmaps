You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

You can take 10 peony flowers and 90 daffodil flowers from the lily field, and 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field.\r\n\r\nThe rose field path has a maximum number of **90** flowers. You did not take any flowers from the orchid field. The sunflower field path has a maximum number of **50** flowers.\r\n\r\nThe lily field path is the best choice for maximizing the number of flowers you can collect.\r\n\r\nHere is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:\r\n```\r\nAnswer: Lily field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear. Let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n**Regular expression explanation:**\r\n\r\nThe regular expression `(([A-Za-z]+,\\s*)*)[A-Za-z]+` matches a string that consists of one or more words, separated by commas and spaces. The words must be alphabetical characters. For example, the string \"Lily field\" would match this regular expression.\r\n\r\nThe `Answer:` prefix is used to indicate that the string is the answer to the puzzle. The `.` character matches any character. The `*` character matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the regular expression will match the string \"Lily field\". This is the answer to the puzzle, so the output of the regular expression will be \"Answer: Lily field\".\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
