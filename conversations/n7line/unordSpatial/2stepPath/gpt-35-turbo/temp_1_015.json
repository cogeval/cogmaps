You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choose the rose field.\n3. Exit the rose field and enter the tulip field.\n4. Exit the tulip field and enter the orchid field.\n5. Learn about the environment in the orchid field (no flowers taken).\n6. Exit the orchid field and return to the entrance.\n7. Choose the sunflower field.\n8. Exit the sunflower field and enter the daisy field.\n9. Exit the daisy field and enter the hydrangea field.\n10. Learn about the environment in the hydrangea field (no flowers taken).\n11. Return to the entrance.\n\nBased on the steps above, we can see that the path through the orchid field allows for 10 orchid flowers, while the path through the hydrangea field does not provide any flowers. Therefore, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the orchid field.\n\nAnswer: Orchid field"
