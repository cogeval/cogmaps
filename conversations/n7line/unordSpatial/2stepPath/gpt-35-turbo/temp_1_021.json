You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, we will reach the tulip field. However, since we do not collect any flowers in the orchid field, the total number of flowers will remain the same as in the rose field.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we will reach the daisy field. Again, we do not collect any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers will remain the same as in the daisy field.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that both paths from the entrance lead to the same maximum number of flowers, which is determined by the respective fields at the end of each path.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The sunflower field or the rose field (as they both lead to the same maximum number of flowers)."
