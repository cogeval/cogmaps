You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we will go through the rose field, then the tulip field, and finally the orchid field, where we can learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we will go through the sunflower field, then the daisy field, and finally the hydrangea field, where we can learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n\nSince we are interested in the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the number of flowers we can obtain from each field. From the orchid field, we can get 10 orchid flowers for free, while from the hydrangea field, we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the hydrangea field.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea field"
