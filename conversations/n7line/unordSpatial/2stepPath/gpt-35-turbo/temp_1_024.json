You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, there are two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. In the rose field, there is a door leading to the tulip field, and from there, to the orchid field. However, there are no flowers to be taken in these fields, so we can ignore them for now.\n3. In the sunflower field, there is a door leading to the daisy field, and from there, to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, there are 50 flowers available, but again, we're not taking any flowers at this point.\n\nConsidering the maximum number of flowers available, the sunflower field with the door to the hydrangea field offers the most flowers (50 hydrangea flowers), while the rose field does not provide any flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
