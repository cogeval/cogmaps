From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

However, if we assume that traveling from Yangon to Thimphu will cost less than traveling from Beijing to Thimphu (since they are both in Southeast Asia), then choosing Path 3 would likely to the least expensive destination.\n\nTherefore, if our assumption is correct, the city from New Delhi that leads to the shortest path where one can find the least expensive destination is Yangon.\n\nAnswer: Yangon (assuming traveling from there to Thimphu costs less than traveling from Beijing)"
