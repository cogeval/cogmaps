You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting at the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, we move to the other end, where there is a door leading to the tulip field. However, no flowers are available in the tulip field.\n\n3. From the tulip field, we move to the orchid field, where we can obtain 10 orchid flowers for free. However, we do not take any flowers at this point.\n\n4. We exit the orchid field and return to the entrance.\n\n5. If we choose the sunflower field instead of the rose field, we move to the daisy field through a door.\n\n6. From the daisy field, there is a door leading to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can obtain 50 hydrangea flowers, but we do not take any flowers.\n\n7.
