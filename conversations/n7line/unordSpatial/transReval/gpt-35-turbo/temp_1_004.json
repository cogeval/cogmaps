You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose field: This field leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field where you can have 10 orchid flowers for free.\n\n2. Sunflower field: This field leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field where you can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nComparing the two options, the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by choosing the path that leads to the hydrangea field. Therefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

Rose field: Previously, this field led to the tulip field, which then led to the orchid field where you could have 10 orchid flowers. But now, the door at the end of the tulip field leads to the hydrangea field, which can potentially have more flowers.\n\n2. Sunflower field: Previously, this field led to the daisy field, which then led to the hydrangea field where you could have 50 hydrangea flowers. But now, the door at the end of the daisy field leads to the orchid field, which may not have as many flowers as the hydrangea field.\n\nComparing the two options, the sunflower field still leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers) as the new door from the daisy field leads to the orchid field, which may have fewer flowers than the hydrangea field.\n\nTherefore, even with the updated connections, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is still the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
