From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

The expenses for the first path remain the same ($400 for Thimphu and $1000 for Tehran), but the expenses for the second path have increased because of the addition of the Beijing-Tehran leg. Therefore, the path through Kathmandu is still the least expensive.\n\nSo, the city from New Delhi that will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination is Kathmandu.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
