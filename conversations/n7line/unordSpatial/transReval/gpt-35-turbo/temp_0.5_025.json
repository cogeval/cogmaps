From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

If you choose Kathmandu, your total expenses will be $400 + the cost of traveling to Beijing and Thimphu. Since you are looking for the least expensive destination, you should choose Kathmandu, as the total expenses are only $400 which is less than the $1000 expenses if you choose Islamabad. Therefore, the city from New Delhi that will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination is Kathmandu.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"

The total expenses in this path will be $400 (expenses in Thimphu) + the cost of traveling to Kathmandu, Beijing, and Tehran.\n\nOn the other hand, if you choose Islamabad, the total expenses will be $1000 (expenses in Tehran) + the cost of traveling to Islamabad, Kabul, and Thimphu. \n\nSince the total expenses in the first path are only $400 + the cost of traveling to three cities, while the total expenses in the second path are $1000 + the cost of traveling to four cities, the first path is the least expensive. Therefore, the city from New Delhi that will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination is Kathmandu.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
