From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

However, we can see that Path 2 has a total expense of $1000, which is higher than the total expense of Path 2 in the previous scenario. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the path that leads to the least expensive destination is Path 1, which starts from New Delhi and goes to Islamabad, Kabul, and Thimphu.\n\nAnswer: Islamabad"
