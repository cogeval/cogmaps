You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, you have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n2. If you choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which in turn leads to the orchid field. However, you don't take any flowers from the orchid field.\n3. If you choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. Again, you don't take any flowers from the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither path leads to any flowers. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None. Neither path from the entrance leads to any flowers."

If you choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which now leads to the hydrangea field.\n3. If you choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which now leads to the orchid field. \n\nSince the hydrangea field is the only field where you can obtain flowers (50 hydrangea flowers), the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: The path from the entrance through the rose field to the hydrangea field."
