You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field: From the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers collected is 0.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: From the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. Again, we do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers collected is 0.\n\nSince both paths result in a total of 0 flowers, it doesn't matter which field we choose from the entrance. The maximum number of flowers we can collect is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 flowers."

We can collect 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: From the sunflower field, we can now reach the orchid field directly. We can collect 10 orchid flowers from the orchid field.\n\nComparing the two options, choosing the rose field leads to a higher number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers) compared to choosing the sunflower field (10 orchid flowers).\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the rose field.\n\nAnswer: Rose field."
