From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"
