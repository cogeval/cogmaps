You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the entrance, you have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If you choose the rose field, you'll go through the rose field, tulip field, and then orchid field. However, in the orchid field, you don't take any flowers.\n\n3. If you choose the sunflower field, you'll go through the sunflower field, daisy field, and then the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, you also don't take any flowers.\n\nBased on this information, neither path will give you any flowers to take. However, if we consider the maximum number of flowers you can learn about in each path, the sunflower field is the better option since you can learn about the environment of the daisy and hydrangea fields.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
