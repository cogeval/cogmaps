You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we will end up in the tulip field. From the tulip field, there is a path to the orchid field, where we can get 10 orchid flowers for free.\n\n2. Starting from the entrance, if we choose the sunflower field, we will end up in the daisy field. From the daisy field, there is a path to the hydrangea field, where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nNow, let's compare the two paths:\n\n1. The path through the rose field gives us 10 orchid flowers.\n2. The path through the sunflower field gives us 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nSince 50 is greater than 10, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."
