You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, you have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n2. If you choose the rose field, you will reach the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field. However, you do not take any flowers in the orchid field.\n3. If you choose the sunflower field, you will reach the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. Again, you do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither the rose field nor the sunflower field leads to any flowers. Therefore, the path with the maximum number of flowers is none of them.\n\nAnswer: There is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
