You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

However, you did not take any flowers, so the maximum number of flowers you could get from the rose field path is 0.\n\nThe sunflower field leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field, where you could have taken 50 flowers. This is the maximum number of flowers you could get from any path, so the sunflower field is the best choice.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the number of flowers you could get from each path:\n\nPath | Number of flowers\n---|---\nRose field \u2192 tulip field \u2192 orchid field | 0\nSunflower field \u2192 daisy field \u2192 hydrangea field | 50\n\nTherefore, the sunflower field is the best choice.\n\n**Here is the output in the regular expression format you requested:**\n\n```\nAnswer: The sunflower field.\n```"
