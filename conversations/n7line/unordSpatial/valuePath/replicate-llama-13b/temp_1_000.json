You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

            "content": "Step 1: Considering how many flowers will need to cover more miles with fewer branches to lead to that path; Let\u2019s determine how much it should choose based solely on flow paths and choose paths with minimal branching that can maximize yield.\" \"Step 2: For the choice to make, Let us observe carefully and calculate in detail by checking each available flowers from rose.\" Since entering from each branch has ten free hydrangea flowers; For further clarity. Choose the sunflower field instead of the orchid.\" As we continue down either flower line, both give out more blouses until you take out their entire path. The daisy leads, in total, to the highest flower for a certain amount.\" Answering based solely on those requirements should have a maximized hydrange flowered total of three hundred that one'll gain in both of these sunflower field paths. This path is the proper amount of a flower and should only cost you one entry from each hydrange.\". Now that the hydrangea gives flowers more open to explore one at a time, the hydrangea paths add. Once a flower will branch out far more than the first set or branch until no more flowers remain along its stems.\" Once this is established as fact the right flower to choose becomes clearly evident. So when selecting your first-time entry the proper step to consider the maximum possible yield in relation to entry flow fields you select at. Once in, take all available orchad or hydrangea flow paths. Answer: You can collect all three hundred hydrangeas with only one sunflower field at the front doorstep by doing this.\" Since both the hydrangea and roses cost much more than a dame and two hydrangeas. Doing this is the smart way of reaching maximum flowers. Haha! That hydrange was the big one that was overshadowed before because this option allows getting far, with the ability to grow much further out.\" And we know it by this result that with only those flowers in bloom to work with from a maximization in stand point this approach leads to the three hundreds flowers yield, that makes complete practical in mathematical and blooming potential! So you see taking the proper steps towards your desired hydrange and only taking an out will give you three hundred blooming fields hydrang the big ones!"
