You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can then proceed to the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, since we do not take any flowers from the orchid field, this path does not contribute any flowers to the total count.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can then proceed to the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. Although we do not take any flowers from the hydrangea field, this path offers the opportunity to collect 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path starting from the entrance and leading to the sunflower field will result in the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"
