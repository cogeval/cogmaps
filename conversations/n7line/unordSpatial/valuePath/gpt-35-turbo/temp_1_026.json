You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Path through the rose field: This path leads to the tulip field, then to the orchid field. However, no flowers are taken in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. Path through the sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field, then to the hydrangea field. Although no flowers are taken in the hydrangea field, it is mentioned that you can have 50 hydrangea flowers from this field. So the total number of flowers in this path is 50.\n\nTherefore, the path through the sunflower field is the one that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
