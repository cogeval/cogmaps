You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field where we can get 10 orchid flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the number of flowers available, we see that choosing the sunflower field and proceeding to the hydrangea field provides a greater number of flowers. Thus, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

Lily field -> Hydrangea field (no specified number of flowers)\n\nComparing the number of flowers available, we can see that choosing the sunflower field and proceeding to the hydrangea field still provides the maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers). The lily field directly leading to the hydrangea field does not provide a specified number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers remains the same: the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
