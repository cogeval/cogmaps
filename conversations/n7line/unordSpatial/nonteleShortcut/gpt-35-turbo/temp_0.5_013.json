You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field:\n   - Rose field: 0 flowers\n   - Tulip field: 0 flowers\n   - Orchid field: 10 orchid flowers\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Sunflower field: 0 flowers\n   - Daisy field: 0 flowers\n   - Hydrangea field: 50 hydrangea flowers\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path with the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts with the sunflower field, leading to the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nAnswer: The sunflower field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Sunflower field: 0 flowers\n   - Daisy field: 0 flowers\n   - Hydrangea field: 50 hydrangea flowers\n\n3. Choosing the lily field:\n   - Lily field: 0 flowers\n   - Hydrangea field: 50 hydrangea flowers\n\nComparing the three paths, we can see that both the path starting with the sunflower field and the path starting with the lily field lead to the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, both fields from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Both the sunflower field and the lily field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
