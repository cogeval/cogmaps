You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If path 3 has fewer flowers than path 2, then we will stick with path 2.\n\nTherefore, we need to find out how many hydrangeas we can get from the Lily field to Hydrangea field. Since we know that the Hydrangea field can provide 50 hydrangeas, and the Lily field is a direct path to it, we can assume that the Lily field can also provide us with at least 50 hydrangeas.\n\nTherefore, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily field"
