You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, there are two paths: one that leads to the rose field, and another that leads to the sunflower field. The rose field leads to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field where you can see but not take 10 free orchid flowers. The sunflower field leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field where you can see but not take 50 free hydrangea flowers. \n\nTo determine which field leads to the maximum number of flowers, we need to add up the number of flowers we can see but not take in each path. If we go through the rose field, we see 0 hydrangea flowers and 10 orchid flowers. If we go through the sunflower field, we see 50 hydrangea flowers and 0 orchid flowers. Therefore, we should choose the path that leads through the sunflower field to the hydrangea field, as that will give us the opportunity to see the most flowers. \n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field"

As we previously determined, the hydrangea field has the highest number of flowers we can see but not take, at 50. Therefore, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Lily Field.\n\nAnswer: Lily Field."
