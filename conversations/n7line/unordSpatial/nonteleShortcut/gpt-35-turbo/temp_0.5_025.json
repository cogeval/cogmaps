You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Lily field \u2192 Hydrangea field (unknown number of hydrangea flowers)\n\nSince we want to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we need to compare the options. We know that option 2 leads to 50 hydrangea flowers, which is the maximum number of flowers we can get from the original paths. \n\nWe don't know how many hydrangea flowers we can get from option 3, but we do know that it leads directly to the hydrangea field, which means it's likely to have more flowers than option 1, which only gives us 10 orchid flowers. \n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts from the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
