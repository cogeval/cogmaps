You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers obtained is 50.\n\nBased on this analysis, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."

Choosing the sunflower field still leads to the daisy field and then the hydrangea field, where we can have 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\n3. Choosing the lily field directly leads to the hydrangea field, where we can also have 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the options, both the sunflower field and the lily field lead to the same maximum number of flowers, which is 50.\n\nTherefore, from the entrance, both the sunflower field and the lily field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field and Lily field."
