From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

The first path is New Delhi -> Islamabad -> Kabul -> Tehran with a total expense of $1000. The second path is New Delhi -> Kathmandu -> Beijing -> Thimphu with a total expense of $400. And the third path is New Delhi-> Yangon-> Thimphu with an unknown expense.\n\nSince we are looking for the least expensive destination, we can eliminate the first option as it has a higher cost than both other options. Therefore, we need to compare between Kathmandu and Yangon routes.\n\nAs per our previous information, traveling from Kathmandu to Thimphu costs $400 in total while there's no information about how much it would cost from Yangon to Thimphu directly.\n\nSo based on available information only, choosing the second path from New Delhi to Kathmandu will lead to the least expensive destination.\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
