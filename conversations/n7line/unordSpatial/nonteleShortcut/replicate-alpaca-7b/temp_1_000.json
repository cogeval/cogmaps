You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

So you can  choose the daisy field - rose - tulip - orchid - flower - daisy. If we use binary search, the number of fields in between daisy and orchid is five, when we choose to enter in between daisy and orchid from the left which have three fields the result is zero. The right has two fields but after midpoint daisy's two will result in two additional flower. Choose between the left or right equals the difference in total to five which equals to three fields. There is also four extra daisy' flower so daisy is answer for flowering max fields. It is more flower if starting with rose and tulipe field than flower. Because after midpoint if choose sun flower result five additional. When chose daisy in beginning the results the number of flower are still higher."
