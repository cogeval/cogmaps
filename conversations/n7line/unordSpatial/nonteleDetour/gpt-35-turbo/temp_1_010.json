You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: Rose field and Sunflower field.\n\nIf we take the Rose field, we can go to the Tulip field and then to the Orchid field. But we do not take any flowers from the Orchid field. Therefore, the Rose field gives us 0 flowers.\n\nIf we take the Sunflower field, we can go to the Daisy field and then to the Hydrangea field. But we do not take any flowers from the Hydrangea field. Therefore, the Sunflower field gives us 0 flowers.\n\nThus, we cannot collect any flowers by taking either of the paths.\n\nAnswer: None of the fields lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

Therefore, the Rose field gives us 0 flowers.\n\nIf we take the Sunflower field, we can go to the Daisy field and then to the Hydrangea field, but we do not take any flowers from the Hydrangea field. Therefore, the Sunflower field gives us 0 flowers.\n\nIf we take the Lily field, we can go to the Peony field and then to the Hydrangea field. We do not know how many flowers we can get from the Peony field, but we can assume it is more than the 10 flowers we can get from the Orchid field. Therefore, the Lily field has the potential to give us the maximum number of flowers.\n\nIf we take the Peony field, we can go to the Hydrangea field, but we do not know how many flowers we can get from the Peony field. Therefore, the Peony field may or may not give us the maximum number of flowers.\n\nThus, choosing the Lily field from the entrance is the best option to potentially get the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
