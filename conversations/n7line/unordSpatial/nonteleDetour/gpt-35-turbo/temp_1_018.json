You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the rose field, we can go to the tulip field, and then to the orchid field where we can learn about the environment without taking any flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers obtained from this path is 0.\n\n2. Starting from the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field, and then to the hydrangea field where we can learn about the environment without taking any flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers obtained from this path is also 0.\n\nSince both paths result in obtaining 0 flowers, neither leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, the answer is that there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

Therefore, the number of flowers obtained from this path is 50.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, the path starting from the lily field is the only option left.
