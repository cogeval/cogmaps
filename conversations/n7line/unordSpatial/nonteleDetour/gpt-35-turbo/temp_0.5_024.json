You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

One path is through the daisy field and the other path is through the peony field. Since we don't know how many flowers we can get from the peony field, we need to compare the number of flowers we can get from the daisy field and the lily field. If we choose the daisy field, we can get to the hydrangea field and collect 50 hydrangea flowers. If we choose the lily field, we can get to the peony field and then to the hydrangea field. Since we don't know how many flowers we can get from the peony field, we need to assume that we can get fewer than 50 flowers. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is through the daisy field.\n\nAnswer: Daisy field."
