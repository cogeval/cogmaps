You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, we can move to the tulip field. However, the tulip field does not provide any additional flowers. Thus, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we can move to the daisy field, which also does not provide any additional flowers. The total number of flowers in this path is also 0.\n\n4. Therefore, neither the rose field nor the sunflower field leads to a path with any flowers.\n\nSince both paths have no flowers, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

From the entrance, we have four choices: the rose field, sunflower field, lily field, or the new field, peony field.\n\n2. Since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to explore other options.\n\n3. If we choose the rose field, we know that it does not lead to any additional flowers, as mentioned before.\n\n4. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which also does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n5. If we choose the lily field, it leads to the peony field, which in turn leads to the hydrangea field. The hydrangea field allows us to have 50 hydrangea flowers for free. This is the maximum number of flowers available in any path so far.\n\n6. Therefore, choosing the lily field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
