You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, no flowers are taken in the orchid field.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. However, no flowers are taken in the hydrangea field.\n\nGiven this information, neither path results in any flowers being taken. Therefore, the maximum number of flowers is 0 regardless of which field is chosen from the entrance.\n\nAnswer: 0 flowers"

Choosing the rose field still leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field with no flowers being taken.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field still leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field with no flowers being taken.\n\n3. Choosing the lily field leads to the peony field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. From the hydrangea field, it was previously mentioned that 50 hydrangea flowers can be obtained.\n\nGiven this information, the only path that leads to obtaining flowers is by choosing the lily field from the entrance. This path leads to the hydrangea field where 50 hydrangea flowers can be obtained.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea field"
