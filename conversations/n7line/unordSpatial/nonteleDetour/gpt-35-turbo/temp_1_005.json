You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

The first path starts from the rose field, leads to the tulip field, and then to the orchid field. However, since you do not take any flowers in the orchid field, this path does not contribute to the total number of flowers.\n\n2. The second path starts from the sunflower field, leads to the daisy field, and then to the hydrangea field. You do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field, so this path also does not contribute to the total number of flowers.\n\nSince neither path results in taking any flowers, the maximum number of flowers we can obtain is zero. Therefore, the answer is: None of the fields from the entrance will lead to a path with the maximum number of flowers."

You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.

From the entrance, the first path is the rose field. This path does not lead to any additional flowers, so we can disregard it.\n\n2. The second path is the sunflower field. This path leads to the daisy field and then to the hydrangea field, where you can obtain 50 hydrangea flowers. However, since this path is blocked, we cannot consider it.\n\n3. The third path is the lily field. This path leads to the peony field, and then to the hydrangea field. Similar to the previous path, we can obtain 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field. Since this path is still accessible, it leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field. Answer: Lily field."
