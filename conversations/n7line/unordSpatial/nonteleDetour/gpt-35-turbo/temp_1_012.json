You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we then move to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers from the orchid field.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we then move to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. However, we do not take any flowers from the hydrangea field either.\n\nSince we are not collecting any flowers, the maximum number of flowers we can have is zero in both cases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No field from the entrance leads to a path with the maximum number of flowers."

If we choose the rose field, we can follow the previous path to the orchid field, where we don't take any flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can follow the previous path to the hydrangea field, where we also don't take any flowers.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we move to the peony field, which leads to the hydrangea field. Since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we will now consider this option.\n\nTherefore, by choosing the lily field, we can reach the hydrangea field, which will offer us 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nHence, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily Field"
