From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

Expenses in Tehran: $1000\n- Path 2: New Delhi -> Kathmandu -> Beijing -> Thimphu. Expenses in Thimphu: $400\n\nStep 2: Compare the expenses in the final destinations of both paths.\n- Expenses in Tehran: $1000\n- Expenses in Thimphu: $400\n\nStep 3: Determine which path leads to the least expensive destination.\n- Since $400 is less than $1000, the path leading to Thimphu is less expensive.\n\nStep 4: Identify the first city in the path leading to the least expensive destination.\n- The first city in the path to Thimphu is Kathmandu.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
