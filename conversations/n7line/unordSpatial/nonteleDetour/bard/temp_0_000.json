You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

The lily field path has a maximum number of **150** flowers, because you can take 10 peony flowers and 90 daffodil flowers from the lily field, and 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field.\r\n\r\nThe portal in the daffodil field allows you to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field, which includes the sunflower field. However, the sunflower field only has 50 flowers, so it is not the best choice.\r\n\r\nThe lily field path is the best choice for maximizing the number of flowers you can collect.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The lily field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear. Let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n**However, I would like to point out that the puzzle is a bit unrealistic.** It is unlikely that you would find 10 peony flowers and 90 daffodil flowers in a single field. Additionally, the portal in the daffodil field seems to allow you to travel to any field in the flower county, which is also unrealistic.\r\n\r\n**Despite these unrealistic elements, the puzzle is still a good exercise in problem-solving.** It requires you to think about the different paths you could take and the maximum number of flowers you could collect from each path.\r\n\r\n**In the new version of the puzzle, the lily field path is still the best choice, as it has a maximum number of **150** flowers.** The other paths all have a maximum number of **50** flowers.\r\n\r\n**However, there is one **catch**.**\r\n\r\nThe puzzle states that you will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. This means that if you choose the lily field path, you will not be able to collect any flowers from the rose field or sunflower field.\r\n\r\nSo, the **best** path to choose depends on your preferences. If you want to collect the maximum number of flowers, then you should choose the lily field path. However, if you want to collect flowers from all three fields, then you should choose the rose field path."
