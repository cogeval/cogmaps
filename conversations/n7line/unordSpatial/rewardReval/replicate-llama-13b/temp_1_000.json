You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

DFD takes us down one path in the garden, let's call that path T(rose Field(R), sunFlowers).\nLet's compare T with two variables N for total, for flowers which you mentioned will add more 360 (2orchids to the hydrangea field, (3orchids multiplied by10 in orchid fields). \nLet;s explore our path as such if your start in orchid and work backwards: if the backlinks is sunflower path has no link other than daisy filed, pick and start sunflowers otherwise take link with hyad range, so back to hydrangeas. So hydrangea links at N/2, otherwise take a flower then take 3 back links for any and flowers at $/8. This leads us into hydrangeas (for $/20 flowers) until link is daisy where backlinks have 99 (33 flowers plus 0 for each hyarage field flower that you did not take any flowers in this case).\nSince hydrage (link from orchid to hydrage field has no flower( back to back at zero.) so N =2* (1 and -1 and pick hydrane (1), otherwise in the first round, we are starting the daisy fields which 55 (53 *9 +3 5), now back linking by pick 2 daisyp then ( hyad range to back- link and pick(hydagne we start round up by 8 back). Then the flower paths becomes sunFlowers at hyad range gives the other 99 flowers +20 to back track the field we pass that N*4 and 612 so hydate comes around. Which path takes us to hydrangea where back Link becomes 2 fields to our starting area from back the daisy file then the round we add to our current of daisy field will be by a multipy effect to 9(3). 2 hydange fields is just like getting one big flower per every (hyadran + sunflowars) rhat gives a total product of the fildes N$8 $44 N$4) or back in at a price of hyade($;d) which is $18 $0 since our product total goes even so hyadrage hydafies, there back link hyrane hyrage fild link sunfld hydate fikdt, our ansnser would then hyade(sun flowers would be N/;55.
