You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

            "content": "It depends on the number of choice provided by the user (two or three). \n\nThe path with the maximum number of flowers is: Going to the rose field, taking the door to the tulip field, taking the door to the orchid field and getting 10 orchid flowers, going to the daisy field, taking the door to the hydrangea field and getting 50 hydrangea flowers. Thus, total 70 flowers. \n\nNow, going to the same rose field, going directly to the tulip field without taking the door to the hydrangea gives us 60 flowers, while going through the daisy field with the same result as above (30 flowers). Therefore, it depends what direction we choose first - roses, sunflowers or daisies - we will eventually reach a total of at least 40 flowers but maximum of 70 flowers through the rose-tulip-orchid-hydrangea path. \n\nNow let's try a second trial. After exiting the rose field we could explore the rest one by one: We choose the tulip field followed by theorchidseldand  thetieyfieldleastatendstoelminimumto8,10;followdbfieldor8,2ndoorwaytopieftheeighthfl  eelandlastto3orchesstoolongwashaveor90t00eefl eeel250,265;nfollowda5eoifirstwaytopaorcs063to8or270tht14fl ees6958if28.

Thus, it can potentially take us more than 30 minutes walk before being sure that we have all combinations and taking less the full maximum flower amount, let alone finding one combination quicker as the second trial shows (7 floridvs.1 minute difference). The question therefore, would become at what point it becomes quicker to reach all the combinations of path potential compared to randomly picking paths while staying with in the flower theme of exploration. To the question, whether or which field has the maximum length of possible combination branches given some choices made and which has potentially a shorter path overall - the answer is the sunflower  with four branches instead of three and less branch turns, however less floral bays as there are two more stages following after, the daisy and hydrangea which follow a similar strategy with less numbers of paths taken overall with maximum results. It might take a combination of choice to achieve ultimate beauty and learn of path diversity along the way with any set of choices as learning and finding the best way in might actually bring less overall choice, branch choices, paths followed to receive at max or above 10 of maximum flower amount given three-stage flowerbelt exploration in some combination. The optimal decision ultimately should lead from the rose or sunflower field to the right side of stage one given path diversity in order to potentially maximize ones flower bloom by 90 or more depending which direction is chosen following some explorations choices already being in the first steps done along this explorable flowercourseway in comparison in either or them all.
