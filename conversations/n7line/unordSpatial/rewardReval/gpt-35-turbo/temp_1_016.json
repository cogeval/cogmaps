You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field (10 orchid flowers)\n2. Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field (50 hydrangea flowers)\n\nSince the goal is to find the field with the maximum number of flowers, the correct choice is the second option. Thus, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Sunflower Field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"

Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field (50 hydrangea flowers)\n\nNow, the number of orchid flowers in the Orchid Field has increased to 100. However, the number of flowers in the Hydrangea Field remains the same at 50. \n\nComparing the two options, the Orchid Field with 100 orchid flowers is the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Thus, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Tulip Field.\n\nAnswer: Tulip Field"
