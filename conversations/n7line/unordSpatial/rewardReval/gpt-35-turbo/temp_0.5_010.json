You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Path through the rose field: This path leads to the tulip field and then to the orchid field. However, since we are not taking any flowers, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. Path through the sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field and then to the hydrangea field. Again, since we are not taking any flowers, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\nSince both paths have 0 flowers, neither of them leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

Path through the rose field: This path leads to the tulip field, and now we know that entering the orchid field from there will give us 100 orchid flowers. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 100.\n\n2. Path through the sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field, and we know that entering the hydrangea field from there will give us the same number of flowers as before, which is 50 hydrangea flowers. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 50.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path through the rose field leads to the maximum number of flowers, which is 100 orchid flowers.\n\nAnswer: The field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the rose field."
