You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can proceed to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field. However, since we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can proceed to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. Again, since we do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field, the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\nTherefore, both options lead to the same outcome of obtaining 0 flowers.

However, since we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, the total number of flowers obtained is still 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can proceed to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. Since the number of flowers in the hydrangea field is the same as before (50), the total number of flowers obtained remains at 0.\n\nTherefore, both options still lead to the same outcome of obtaining 0 flowers.
