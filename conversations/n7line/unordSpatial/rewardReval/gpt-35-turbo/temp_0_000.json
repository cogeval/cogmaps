From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

However, we know that the total expenses for Path 1 will be significantly lower than $1000 due to the coupon for hotels in Tehran. Therefore, it is likely that Path 1 will be the least expensive option.\n\nAnswer: We cannot determine the exact answer without knowing the cost of the Islamabad to Tehran flight, but it is likely that the path through Islamabad will lead to the least expensive destination."
