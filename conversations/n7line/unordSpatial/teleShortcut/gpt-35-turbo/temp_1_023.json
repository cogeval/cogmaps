You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

However, there are no more flower fields after the orchid field.\n\nOption 2: Choosing the sunflower field:\n- From the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field (with 50 hydrangea flowers). However, there are no more flower fields after the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on the given information, it is clear that choosing the sunflower field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers, as it allows us to collect 50 hydrangea flowers. \n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"

The hydrangea field: From the hydrangea field, we can reach the daisy field, but we have already considered this path.\n\nBased on the given options, choosing the sunflower field will still lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers).\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"
