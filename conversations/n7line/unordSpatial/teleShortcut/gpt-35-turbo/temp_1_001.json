You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose field:\n   - Leads to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field (10 orchid flowers).\n   - Total flowers: 10 orchid flowers.\n\n2. Sunflower field:\n   - Leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field (50 hydrangea flowers).\n   - Total flowers: 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the two options, the sunflower field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers, as it provides 50 hydrangea flowers.
