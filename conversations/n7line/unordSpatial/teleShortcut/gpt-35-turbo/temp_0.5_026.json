You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we will go through the tulip field and then the orchid field, where we can learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we will go through the daisy field and then the hydrangea field, where we can also learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n\nSince we cannot take any flowers from either the orchid or hydrangea fields, the number of flowers we can obtain will depend on the fields we pass through.\n\nConsidering that we have two choices: rose field and sunflower field, we need to compare the number of fields we pass through in each option.\n\n1. If we choose the rose field, we pass through three fields: rose, tulip, and orchid.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we pass through three fields: sunflower, daisy, and hydrangea.\n\nSince both options have the same number of fields, we need to consider the maximum number of flowers we can obtain in each option.\n\n1. In the rose field option, we cannot obtain any flowers.\n\n2. In the sunflower field option, we cannot obtain any flowers.\n\nTherefore, neither option leads to obtaining any flowers."
