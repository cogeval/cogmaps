You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field: This path does not have any flowers to collect, so the total number of flowers is 0.\n\n2. Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field: This path does not have any flowers to collect, so the total number of flowers is 0.\n\nTherefore, both paths have an equal number of flowers, which is 0. Thus, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: No field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

However, the Orchid Field does not have any flowers to collect, so the total number of flowers for this path is 0.\n\n2. Sunflower Field: This path leads to the Hydrangea Field, where you can collect 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers for this path is 50.\n\nSince the Sunflower Field leads to the maximum number of flowers (50), the best choice is to go to the Sunflower Field from the portal.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field."
