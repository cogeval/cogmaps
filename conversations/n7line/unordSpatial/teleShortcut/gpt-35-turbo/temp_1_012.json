You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field: This path leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, since you don't take any flowers in the orchid field, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers in the hydrangea field, but you don't take any flowers. Hence, the total number of flowers in this path is also 0.\n\nSince both paths have the same total number of flowers (0), neither path leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The hydrangea field: This field allows you to have 50 hydrangea flowers, but you don't take any flowers. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\nSince the hydrangea field doesn't provide any additional flowers, there is no neighbor field of the daisy field that leads to an increase in the total number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: None of the neighbor fields of the daisy field will maximize the number of flowers."
