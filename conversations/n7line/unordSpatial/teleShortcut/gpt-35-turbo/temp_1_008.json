You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can go to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field where we can learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field where we can learn about the environment but not take any flowers.\n\nComparing the two options, it is clear that the sunflower field is the better choice because it leads to the hydrangea field, where we can learn about the environment and have access to 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"

If we choose the sunflower field, we can go back to the entrance and follow the initial path, which leads to the orchid field. However, in the orchid field, we cannot take any flowers, only learn about the environment.\n\nComparing the options, it is clear that choosing the hydrangea field from the portal will lead to the maximum number of flowers since we can have 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of flowers, we choose the hydrangea field from the portal.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field"
