You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we are not allowed to take any flowers from the orchid field, so this path does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. From the hydrangea field, we can obtain 50 hydrangea flowers for free. This path offers the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

To maximize the number of flowers, we need to choose the field that has the highest flower yield among the neighbor fields of the daisy field. Since we do not have specific information about the neighbor fields, it is not possible to make a definitive choice based solely on the information provided.\n\nWithout knowing the flower yield of the neighbor fields of the daisy field, we cannot determine which field to choose to maximize the number of flowers from the entrance portal.\n\nAnswer: Cannot be determined."
