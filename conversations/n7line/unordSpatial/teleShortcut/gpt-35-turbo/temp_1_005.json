You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Path 2: Entrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field\n   - Hydrangea Field: 50 hydrangea flowers\n\nBased on the number of flowers, Path 2 (Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field) leads to the maximum number of flowers with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field"

Daisy Field: Since we are already in the daisy field, there are no additional flowers to collect.\n\nTherefore, we should choose to go to the Sunflower Field from the portal to maximize the number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"
