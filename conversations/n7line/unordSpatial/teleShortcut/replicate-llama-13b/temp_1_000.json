You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

(Hypothetical maximum possible) flowers you might be leaving from an accessible point without moving away/ending your tour with what each path leads and without having a backtrack as an ending for that branch, what is the maximum possible result you come to possess? You see what that result entails later while comparing, I would give my personal pick and reasoning in the next response. For that purpose I'd like the answer (the first path of entrance) you are working into this task which would of course determine my verbalized feedback based on whether your answer converges towards your anticipated goal and final pick or not so feel free to write down whatsoever' first inclination toward solving that math you are attempting. Also please state it as any letters are received or formed during that possible 1st or 2nd branch and not solely by '+'] you will use + to bind multiple things atop one another. Now start"
