You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

The sunflower field path has a maximum number of flowers of 50 (50 hydrangea flowers). Therefore, the sunflower field path has the maximum number of flowers.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The sunflower field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear.

The other neighbor fields, the rose field and the sunflower field, have maximum numbers of flowers of 90 and 50, respectively.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the hydrangea field is the best choice for maximizing the number of flowers I can collect.\r\n\r\nHere is a table summarizing the number of flowers I could collect from each neighbor field of the daisy field:\r\n\r\nField | Number of flowers\r\n---|---\r\nHydrangea field | 50\r\nRose field | 90\r\nSunflower field | 50\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best choice is the **hydrangea field**.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The hydrangea field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear.
