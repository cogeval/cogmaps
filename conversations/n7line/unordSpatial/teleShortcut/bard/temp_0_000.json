You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Here is the solution to the puzzle:\r\n\r\nThe original answer was the sunflower field, but the new information changes the paths available to you.\r\n\r\nThe new paths are:\r\n\r\n* **Rose field \u2192 tulip field \u2192 orchid field (100 flowers)**\r\n* **Sunflower field \u2192 hydrangea field (50 flowers)**\r\n\r\nThe rose field path now has the maximum number of flowers, so the best choice is the **rose field**.\r\n\r\nHere is a table summarizing the number of flowers you could get from each path:\r\n\r\nPath | Number of flowers\r\n---|---\r\nRose field \u2192 tulip field \u2192 orchid field | 100\r\nSunflower field \u2192 hydrangea field | 50\r\n\r\nTherefore, the rose field is the best choice.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The rose field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I notice that you said that you did not take any flowers from the orchid field. If that is the case, then the maximum number of flowers you could get from the rose field path is actually 90, since you would not have taken the 10 free orchid flowers.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the sunflower field path would actually have the maximum number of flowers, since you could get 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field.\r\n\r\nHere is a table summarizing the number of flowers you could get from each path if you do not take any flowers:\r\n\r\nPath | Number of flowers\r\n---|---\r\nRose field \u2192 tulip field \u2192 orchid field | 90\r\nSunflower field \u2192 hydrangea field | 50\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you do not take any flowers from the orchid field, then the best choice is the **sunflower field**.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The sunflower field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the puzzle states that you can have 10 orchid flowers for free from the orchid field, so you must take them. Therefore, the rose field path is the best choice.\r\n\r\n**Here is the answer in the regular expression format you requested:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: The rose field.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear.
