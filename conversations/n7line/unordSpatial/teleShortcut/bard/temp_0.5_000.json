From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

The total expenses for this path are $400 + $380 = $780.\n\nThe other path starts in Islamabad and goes to Kabul, then Thimphu. The total expenses for this path are $1000 + $400 = $1400.\n\nTherefore, the least expensive destination is Thimphu, and the city that leads to the path where one can find the least expensive destination is **Kathmandu**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the expenses for each path:\n\n* **Path 1:** Kathmandu \u2192 Kabul \u2192 Thimphu\n    * Total expenses: $780\n* **Path 2:** Islamabad \u2192 Kabul \u2192 Thimphu\n    * Total expenses: $1400\n\nTherefore, the answer is **Kathmandu**.\n\n**Answer: Kathmandu**\n\nHowever, if you are offered a direct flight to any city from New Delhi, then you should choose **Kathmandu**, as this will save you the cost of the flight to Islamabad.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the expenses for each path, assuming you take the direct flight to Kathmandu:\n\n* **Path 1:** Kathmandu \u2192 Beijing \u2192 Thimphu\n    * Total expenses: $400 + $400 = $800\n* **Path 2:** Islamabad \u2192 Kabul \u2192 Thimphu\n    * Total expenses: $1000 + $400 = $1400\n\nTherefore, the answer is still **Kathmandu**, even if you are offered a direct flight to another city."
