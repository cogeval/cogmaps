From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

The first path leads from New Delhi to Islamabad, Kabul, and finally Tehran with a total expense of $1000. The second path goes from New Delhi to Kathmandu, Beijing and lastly Thimphu which has a total expense of $400. However, now there is an option for a direct flight to any city which needs to be considered as well.\n\nWe can calculate the expenses for other possible destinations by using the previous paths as references:\n\n- If you choose Islamabad directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expenses: $550\n- If you choose Kabul directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expenses: $800\n- If you choose Tehran directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expenses: $1000\n- If you choose Kathmandu directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expenses: $550\n- If you choose Beijing directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expenses: 330 (from Kathmandu) + 400 = $730 \n- If you choose Thimphu directly from New Delhi with the travel agency's offer - Total Expences :$760 (from Beijing)\n\nTherefore choosing Islamabad or Kathmandu will lead you on paths where one can find less expensive destinations than others.\n\nAnswer: One can select either Islamabad or Kathmandu depending upon their preferences because these are two options that have a route leading up to them that would lead someone through lower cost cities ultimately resulting in lower costs than if traveling elsewhere."
