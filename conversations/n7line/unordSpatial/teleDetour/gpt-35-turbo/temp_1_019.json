You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field: From the rose field, we can access the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field. So, this path does not contribute to the total number of flowers.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: From the sunflower field, we can access the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. Although we also do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field, it mentions that we can have 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, this path adds 50 flowers to the total count.\n\nBased on this analysis, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Rose field: This path does not lead to any additional flowers.\n\n2. Sunflower field: This path also does not lead to any additional flowers.\n\n3. Lily field: From the lily field, we can access the peony field and then the daffodil field. However, it mentions that there is a portal from the daffodil field to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since the daisy field was previously mentioned to have a door leading to the hydrangea field (with 50 flowers), we can assume that the daffodil field can also lead to the hydrangea field. Therefore, taking this path would allow us to obtain 50 additional flowers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily field"
