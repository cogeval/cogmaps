You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

But in this case, it's blocked, and we need to find an alternative path. \n\nFrom the Daffodil Field, there is a portal to any neighbor field of the Daisy Field. As we know that the Daisy Field has a door that leads to the Hydrangea Field, we can assume that the neighbor fields of Daisy Field are the Lily and Peony Fields. \n\nTherefore, we need to calculate the total number of flowers we can get from each path: \n\nPath 1: Entrance -> Lily Field -> Peony Field -> Daffodil Field (use portal to Daisy Field) -> Hydrangea Field = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 = 50 flowers\nPath 2: Entrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field (blocked) -> Return to entrance -> Lily Field -> Peony Field -> Daffodil Field (use portal to Daisy Field) -> Hydrangea Field = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 = 50 flowers\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Lily Field which leads to the Peony Field, the Daffodil Field (using portal to Daisy Field), and then to the Hydrangea Field. \n\nAnswer: Lily Field."
