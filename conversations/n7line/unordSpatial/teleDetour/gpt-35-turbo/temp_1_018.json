You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can go through the tulip field to the orchid field, where we can get 10 orchid flowers for free. So the total number of flowers we can get from this path is 10.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can go through the daisy field to the hydrangea field, where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free. So the total number of flowers we can get from this path is 50.\n\nTherefore, the path with the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts from the sunflower field, which leads to the hydrangea field. \n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field."

If we choose the lily field, the path leads to the peony field and then the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have multiple options to choose from.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the alternative paths from the daffodil field. \n\nWe need more information to determine which neighbor field of the daisy field we can choose from the portal in the daffodil field. Without knowing the specific options, we cannot calculate the number of flowers we can collect from this path.\n\nTherefore, we should choose the path that leads from the entrance to the sunflower field, which leads to the hydrangea field and allows us to collect 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field."
