You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

However, in the orchid field, we don't take any flowers. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\nOption 2: Choosing the sunflower field.\nThis path leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers, but we don't take any flowers. So, the total number of flowers in this path is also 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, both paths lead to the same outcome of 0 flowers. Therefore, neither field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Neither field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.

From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the available alternative paths. Since the daffodil field allows us to access any neighbor field of the daisy field through the portal, we have the opportunity to potentially reach a field with more flowers.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of flowers, we need to evaluate the potential neighbor fields of the daisy field and choose the one with the highest number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Choosing the lily field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
