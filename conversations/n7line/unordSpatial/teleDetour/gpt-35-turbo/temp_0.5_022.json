You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we don't take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. Again, we don't take any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\nTherefore, both paths lead to the same outcome of not obtaining any flowers. Hence, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field, but we don't take any flowers in the orchid field.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field, but we don't take any flowers in the hydrangea field.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we can reach the peony field and then the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have the option to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the alternative paths. As we have the option to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field, we can choose the hydrangea field as the neighbor field. This way, we can obtain 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea field."
