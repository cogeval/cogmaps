You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Blocked path\n\nSince the path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the other three paths. \n\nFrom path 1, we can get 10 orchid flowers. \n\nFrom path 2, we can get 50 hydrangea flowers. \n\nFrom path 3, we can potentially access any neighbor field of the Daisy field, which includes the Hydrangea field (50 hydrangea flowers). \n\nTherefore, the path with the maximum number of flowers is path 3, which starts from the Lily field and leads to the Hydrangea field through the portal.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
