You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

In the orchid field, we can have 10 orchid flowers for free.\n\nIf we choose the sunflower field, we will proceed to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nSince the number of flowers in the hydrangea field (50) is greater than the number of flowers in the orchid field (10), choosing the sunflower field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

However, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.\n\nIf we choose the lily field, we will proceed to the peony field, and then to the daffodil field, where we have the portal to the neighboring fields.\n\nConsidering that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we can still explore the possibility of accessing other fields through the portal from the daffodil field.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers would be the daffodil field, as it provides access to any neighbor field through the portal.\n\nAnswer: Daffodil field"
