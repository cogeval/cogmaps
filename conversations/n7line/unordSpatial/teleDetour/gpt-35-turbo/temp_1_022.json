You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose field path:\n   - Rose field: No flowers.\n   - Tulip field: No flowers.\n   - Orchid field: 10 orchid flowers.\n\nTotal flowers for the rose field path: 10.\n\n2. Sunflower field path:\n   - Sunflower field: No flowers.\n   - Daisy field: No flowers.\n   - Hydrangea field: 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTotal flowers for the sunflower field path: 50.\n\n3. Lily field path:\n   - Lily field: No flowers.\n   - Peony field: No flowers.\n   - Daffodil field: Unknown flower count.\n\nSince the regular path is blocked, we cannot determine the flower count for the Daffodil field through the portal.\n\nComparing the total flowers for each path, we can see that the sunflower field path still leads to the maximum number of flowers with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, even with the additional fields and the blocked regular path, the sunflower field remains the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."
