You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Lily field -> Peony field -> Daffodil field: This path does not yield any flowers.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider alternative paths. Since the portal from the Daffodil field allows access to any neighbor field of the Daisy field, we can choose to go from the Daffodil field to the Daisy field, which leads to the Hydrangea field. This path yields 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."
