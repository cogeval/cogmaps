You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field and then to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n2. Starting from the entrance, if we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field and then to the hydrangea field. Again, we do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\nBased on this evaluation, neither path leads to any flowers. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

However, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, so we cannot proceed further. Therefore, the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n3. Starting from the entrance, if we choose the lily field, it leads to the peony field and then to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since the daisy field leads to the hydrangea field, which offers 50 hydrangea flowers, this path leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
