You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field:\n   - From the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field.\n   - However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field.\n   - Therefore, the total number of flowers obtained from this path is 0.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - From the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field.\n   - In the hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free, but we do not take any flowers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of flowers obtained from this path is 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, both paths lead to the same outcome of obtaining 0 flowers. Therefore, neither the rose field nor the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Choosing the lily field:\n   - From the lily field, we can reach the peony field, which leads to the daffodil field.\n   - The daffodil field has a portal to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n   - Since the regular path is blocked, we can choose a neighbor field that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n   - Without knowing the specific number of flowers in each neighbor field, we cannot determine the maximum number of flowers obtained from this path.\n\nBased on the analysis, the lily field provides the potential for reaching the path with the maximum number of flowers, considering the available options. However, without additional information about the specific number of flowers in each neighbor field, we cannot determine the exact field that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: The lily field provides the potential for reaching the path with the maximum number of flowers, but without additional information, the specific field cannot be determined."
