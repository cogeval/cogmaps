You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Since the regular path is blocked, we need to consider the possible paths that we can take from the Daffodil field's portal. \n\nFrom the Daffodil field, we can access any of its neighbor fields, including the Daisy field, which leads to the Hydrangea field where we can get 50 flowers. So, the maximum number of flowers we can get from the original fields is still 50 from the Hydrangea field.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is still the Sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field."
