You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the Rose field:\n   - From the Rose field, we can reach the Tulip field, which leads to the Orchid field.\n   - However, in the Orchid field, we don't take any flowers.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. Choosing the Sunflower field:\n   - From the Sunflower field, we can reach the Daisy field, which leads to the Hydrangea field.\n   - In the Hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of flowers in this path is 50.\n\nTherefore, choosing the Sunflower field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Choosing the Rose field:\n   - Previously determined to have 0 flowers in the path.\n\n2. Choosing the Sunflower field:\n   - Previously determined to have 50 flowers in the path.\n\n3. Choosing the Lily field:\n   - From the Lily field, we can reach the Peony field, which leads to the Daffodil field.\n   - The Daffodil field has a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the Daisy field.\n   - Since the path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the remaining fields: Hydrangea field and Daisy field.\n\nConsidering that the Hydrangea field offers 50 flowers and the Daisy field offers no flowers, the maximum number of flowers we can obtain in this scenario is 50.\n\nTherefore, choosing the Lily field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
