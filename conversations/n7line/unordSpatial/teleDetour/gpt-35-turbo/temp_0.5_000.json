You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, and then to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers from the orchid field.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, and then to the hydrangea field. Similarly, we do not take any flowers from the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on the information provided, neither path allows us to collect any flowers. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance lead to a path with the maximum number of flowers."

When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, and then to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers from the orchid field.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field through the hydrangea field. Again, we do not take any flowers from the daisy field.\n\n4. If we choose the lily field, it leads to the peony field, and then to the daffodil field. However, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, so we cannot proceed further.\n\n5. If we choose the daisy field through the portal, we have the option to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since we cannot go to the blocked field, the only remaining option is the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on the available choices, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: The hydrangea field."
