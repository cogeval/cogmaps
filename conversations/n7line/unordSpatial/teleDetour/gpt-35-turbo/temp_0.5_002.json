You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the two options, we can see that choosing the sunflower field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.

Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Leads to the daisy field, which is blocked.\n\n3. Choosing the lily field:\n   - Leads to the peony field, which leads to the daffodil field with a portal.\n\nFrom the daffodil field's portal, we can go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since the daisy field is blocked, we need to consider the other neighbor fields:\n\n- The hydrangea field: Offers 50 hydrangea flowers.\n- The lily field: Leads back to the entrance.\n- The peony field: Leads to the daffodil field, which is already visited.\n\nComparing the options, choosing the lily field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.
