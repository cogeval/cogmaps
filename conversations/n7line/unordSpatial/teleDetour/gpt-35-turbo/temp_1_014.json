You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field:\n   - Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field (no flowers taken)\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field (no flowers taken)\n\nBased on the given information, neither path leads to taking any flowers. Therefore, both paths have zero flowers. Therefore, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: None"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field (no flowers taken)\n\n3. Choosing the lily field:\n   - Lily field -> Peony field -> Daffodil field (no flowers taken)\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the other available options.\n\nWe know that from the daffodil field, there is a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. So, by choosing the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then use the portal to access other fields.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
