You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

But we're not taking any flowers from the orchid field, so we can skip it and come back to the entrance.\n\nNow we take the other path from the entrance, which is the sunflower field, then the daisy field, and finally the hydrangea field, where we can have 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nSo, the maximum number of flowers we can get is 50 from the hydrangea field. \n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field."

From the given information, we don't know which fields are neighbors of the daisy field or how many flowers they have. Therefore, we cannot determine which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: We cannot determine which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers because we don't know which neighbor field of the daisy field has the most flowers."
