You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field: From the rose field, we go through the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field with 10 orchid flowers.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: From the sunflower field, we go through the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path with the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts from the sunflower field, as it leads to the hydrangea field with 50 flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Sunflower field: The previous path from the sunflower field led to the hydrangea field, which had 50 flowers. However, this path is now blocked.\n\n2. Rose field: This path leads to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field with 10 flowers. However, we know that there are more flowers available in other fields.\n\n3. Lily field: This is a new field that leads to the peony field, which in turn leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, there is a portal that allows us to access any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, the best option is to choose the Lily field. From the daffodil field, we can use the portal to access the neighboring fields and potentially find a field with more flowers.\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
