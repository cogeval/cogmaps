You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Path through the sunflower field: \n- Sunflower field \u2192 Daisy field \u2192 Hydrangea field (50 hydrangea flowers)\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path through the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers, with a total of 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Without specific information about the neighboring fields of the daisy field, we cannot determine the number of flowers for this path.\n\nBased on the available information, the path through the sunflower field is still the best option with a total of 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
