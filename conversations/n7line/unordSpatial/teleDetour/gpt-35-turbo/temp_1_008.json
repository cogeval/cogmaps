You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose field: This field only leads to the tulip field, which in turn leads to the orchid field where you can get 10 orchid flowers for free. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 10.\n\n2. Sunflower field: This field leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, you can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free. So, the total number of flowers in this path is 50.\n\nComparing the two paths, the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers with 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

However, this path does not provide the maximum number of flowers.\n\n2. Sunflower field: This field leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field where you can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free. However, the regular path to this field is blocked, so we need to explore other options.\n\n3. Lily field: This field leads to the peony field, which then leads to the daffodil field. The daffodil field has a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince the regular path to the hydrangea field is blocked, we can choose to take the portal from the daffodil field to reach the daisy field. From the daisy field, we can then proceed to the hydrangea field and collect the maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers).\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lily field"
