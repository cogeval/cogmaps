You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Therefore, the path through the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers. \n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field."

However, since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the alternative paths.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that the lily field leads to the peony field, which leads to the daffodil field. The daffodil field has a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. So, we can use the portal to go to the hydrangea field, which we know has 50 flowers. \n\nTherefore, the path from the lily field to the peony field to the daffodil field, and then to the hydrangea field through the portal will lead to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field."
