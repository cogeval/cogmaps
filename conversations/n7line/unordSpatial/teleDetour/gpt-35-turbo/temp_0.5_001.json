You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Choosing the rose field: This path leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\n2. Choosing the sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can have 50 hydrangea flowers, but we do not take any flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\nBased on the analysis, both paths result in obtaining 0 flowers. Therefore, neither the rose field nor the sunflower field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we can explore the neighbor fields of the daisy field to find the maximum number of flowers.\n\nConsidering that the daisy field leads to the hydrangea field, which has the maximum number of flowers (50), we can conclude that choosing the lily field and using the portal to reach the neighbor field with the maximum number of flowers (hydrangea field) will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: The lily field, using the portal to reach the hydrangea field, will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
