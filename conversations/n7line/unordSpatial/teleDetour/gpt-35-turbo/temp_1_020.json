You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

            "content": "To determine which field from the entrance leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers, we need to compare the number of flowers available in each field along both paths. \n\nFirst, let's consider the path through the rose field. From the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we don't collect any flowers in these fields. So, the total number of flowers we can obtain from this path is 0.\n\nNext, let's consider the path through the sunflower field. From the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. In the hydrangea field, we can collect 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers we can obtain from this path is 50.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path through the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.

Path through the sunflower field (as mentioned earlier): This path leads to the daisy field and then the hydrangea field, where we can collect 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\n2. Path through the lily field: This path leads to the peony field, and then to the daffodil field, which has a portal to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since we don't have information about the number of flowers in the neighboring fields, we cannot determine the maximum number of flowers we can obtain through this path.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path through the sunflower field still leads to the known maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers). Therefore, even though the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, the sunflower field is still the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
