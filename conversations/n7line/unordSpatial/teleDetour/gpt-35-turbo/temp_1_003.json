You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

This allows us to access any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nTo determine which neighbor field has the maximum number of flowers, we need more information about the flower counts in each neighbor field. Without that information, it is not possible to accurately determine which field will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Cannot be determined without more information."
