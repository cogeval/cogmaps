You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Starting from the rose field, we can get 0 flowers. From the tulip field, we can get 0 flowers. From the orchid field, we can get 10 orchid flowers. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we can get 0 flowers from the daisy field, but from the hydrangea field, we can get 50 hydrangea flowers. Thus, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is the one that goes through the hydrangea field. \n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Starting from the lily field, we can get 0 flowers. From the peony field, we can get 0 flowers. From the daffodil field, we have multiple options to explore. We can choose to go to the daisy field to get 0 flowers, or we can explore the neighbor fields from the portal and choose the field with the maximum number of flowers. Since we don't know the number of flowers we can get from each field and we can only choose one path, we will assume that the maximum number of flowers is from one of the fields we have already visited. Based on our previous calculation, we know that the hydrangea field has the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, we will choose the sunflower field again, which leads to the hydrangea field.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea Field."
