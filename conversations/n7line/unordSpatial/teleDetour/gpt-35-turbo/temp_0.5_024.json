You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can go to the tulip field and then to the orchid field. However, we don't take any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers we can collect is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field and then to the hydrangea field. Again, we don't take any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers we can collect is 0.\n\nSince both paths result in no flowers being collected, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

From the lily field, we can continue to the peony field and then to the daffodil field. However, since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we cannot collect any flowers in the daffodil field.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field and then to the hydrangea field. Similar to the previous scenario, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, so we cannot collect any flowers in the hydrangea field.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we can go to the peony field and then to the daffodil field. As mentioned earlier, the daffodil field has a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since we want to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we can take the portal from the daffodil field to the hydrangea field. From there, we can collect 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Lily field."
