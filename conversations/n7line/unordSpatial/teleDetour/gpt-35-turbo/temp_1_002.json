You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Rose Field: This field only leads to the Tulip field, which in turn leads to the Orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers from the Orchid field, so this path does not contribute to the total number of flowers.\n\n2. Sunflower Field: This field leads to the Daisy field, which leads to the Hydrangea field. From the Hydrangea field, we can have 50 flowers. Since we are considering the maximum number of flowers, this path contributes significantly to the total number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the Sunflower Field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"

Since the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we can utilize the portal to choose a different path.\n\nGiven that we want to maximize the number of flowers, we can choose the portal from the Daffodil field to go directly to the Hydrangea field. This way, we can obtain 50 Hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers, considering the new options, is the Lily Field.\n\nAnswer: Lily Field"
