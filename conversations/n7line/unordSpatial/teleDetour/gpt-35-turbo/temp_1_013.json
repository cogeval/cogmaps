You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Start with the Rose Field:\n   - Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field (0 flowers)\n\n2. Start with the Sunflower Field:\n   - Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field (50 hydrangea flowers)\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that starting with the Sunflower Field will lead to the maximum number of flowers with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

Start with the Sunflower Field:\n   - Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> [Blocked Path]\n\n2. Start with the Lily Field:\n   - Lily Field -> Peony Field -> Daffodil Field -> [Portal]\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked when starting with the Sunflower Field, we need to explore the path starting with the Lily Field.\n\nConsidering that the portal from the Daffodil Field allows access to any neighbor field of the Daisy Field, we can potentially reach the Hydrangea Field, which previously provided 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nTherefore, starting with the Lily Field has the potential to lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Lily Field"
