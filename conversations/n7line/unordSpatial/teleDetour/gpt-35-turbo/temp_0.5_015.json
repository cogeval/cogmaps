You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, we do not take any flowers in the orchid field.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. Again, we do not take any flowers in the hydrangea field.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither path leads to any flowers. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance lead to a path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

From the lily field, it leads to the peony field, and finally to the daffodil field. However, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, and then to the hydrangea field. However, the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, it leads to the peony field, and then to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nConsidering that the regular path is blocked, the only option that leads to the possibility of reaching the maximum number of flowers is by choosing the lily field and using the portal from the daffodil field to access the neighbor fields of the daisy field.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the lily field."
