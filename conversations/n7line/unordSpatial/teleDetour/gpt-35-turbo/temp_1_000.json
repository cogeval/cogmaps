You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we will reach the orchid field, where we can get 10 orchid flowers for free.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we will reach the hydrangea field, where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free.\n\nComparing the two paths, the path with the maximum number of flowers is the one that leads to the hydrangea field. Therefore, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

If we choose the rose field, the path is blocked, so we can't proceed further.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we will reach the hydrangea field, where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we will reach the peony field, which leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince we are trying to find the path with the maximum number of flowers, and the regular path is blocked, we will need to explore the other possibilities from the daffodil field. Without knowing the specific options, we cannot determine the exact number of flowers in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the field from the entrance that will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field."
