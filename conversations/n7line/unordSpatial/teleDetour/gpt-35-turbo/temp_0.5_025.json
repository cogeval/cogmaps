You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

From the entrance, you have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n2. If you choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field. However, you do not take any flowers from the orchid field.\n3. If you choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. However, you do not take any flowers from the hydrangea field.\n\nGiven that you cannot take any flowers, the number of flowers in each field is irrelevant. The important factor is the number of fields you can explore.\n\nIn this case, the path with the maximum number of fields to explore is the one that leads to the orchid field. Therefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the rose field.\n\nAnswer: Rose field"

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

The sunflower field leads to the daisy field, which then leads to the hydrangea field. However, you do not take any flowers from the hydrangea field.\n4. The lily field leads to the peony field, which then leads to the daffodil field. However, there is a blocked path from the daffodil field to the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n5. Any neighbor field of the daisy field is not accessible because the regular path is blocked.\n\nGiven that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the remaining options.\n\nThe only fields left are the rose field, the sunflower field, and the lily field. Since we cannot access any neighbor field of the daisy field, we cannot consider those options.\n\nOut of the remaining fields, the sunflower field leads to the daisy field, which is the last accessible field before the blocked path. Therefore, the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers is the sunflower field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field"
