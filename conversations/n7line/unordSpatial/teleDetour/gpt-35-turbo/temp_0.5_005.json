            "content": "Imagine a flower county with six flower fields. From the entrance you have two choices, you can go to the rose field or sunflower field. You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

            "content": "To find the field that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field, where we can get 10 orchid flowers for free. However, we do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field, where we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free. Again, we do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\nSince both paths result in the same number of flowers (0), neither the rose field nor the sunflower field leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: None of the fields from the entrance lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.

However, we do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, but the regular path to the hydrangea field is blocked. Therefore, we cannot access the hydrangea field and cannot obtain any flowers in this path.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we can reach the peony field and then the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. Since the hydrangea field is a neighbor field of the daisy field, we can access it through the portal. In the hydrangea field, we can get 50 hydrangea flowers for free. Again, we do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers in this path is 0.\n\nSince the lily field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers (0), the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The lily field from the entrance leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
