            "content": "Imagine a flower county with six flower fields. From the entrance you have two choices, you can go to the rose field or sunflower field. You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field and then the orchid field. However, we don't collect any flowers in the orchid field, so the total number of flowers collected would be 0.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field and then the hydrangea field. Again, we don't collect any flowers in the hydrangea field, so the total number of flowers collected would be 0.\n\nSince both paths result in collecting 0 flowers, neither option leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, there is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The daffodil field has a portal. From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, but the regular path to the orchid field is blocked. Therefore, we cannot collect any flowers in the orchid field.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, but the regular path from the daisy field is blocked. However, we have the option to use the portal in the daffodil field to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. This means we can still access the hydrangea field, where we can collect 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\n3. If we choose the lily field, we can reach the peony field and then the daffodil field. As mentioned before, the regular path from the daffodil field is blocked, but we can use the portal to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field. This allows us to reach the hydrangea field and collect 50 hydrangea flowers.\n\nComparing the options, both the sunflower field and the lily field lead to the hydrangea field, where we can collect 50 hydrangea flowers. Therefore, both options lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Both the sunflower field and the lily field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers."
