You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

Let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I have corrected my previous answer, which incorrectly stated that the sunflower field path had a maximum number of flowers of 100.\r\n\r\n**Additional note:** I understand that you said that you did not take any flowers from the orchid field, but this does not change the fact that the rose field path has a maximum number of 90 flowers. The 10 orchid flowers are still part of the path, even if you do not take them."
