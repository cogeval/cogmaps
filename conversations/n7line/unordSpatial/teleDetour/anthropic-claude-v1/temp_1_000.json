From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses.

From here, we can choose any other city according to our preference.\n\nBut since we have previously established that the Kathmandu path leads to the least expensive destination, it would be wise to take that path again and choose an alternate destination from Beijing or Thimphu.\n\nSo, choosing Kathmandu as the city from New Delhi will still lead us to the path where one can find a relatively less expensive destination.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
