From Islamabad, you can go to Kabul and from there to Tehran. In Tehran, your total expenses will be $1000 including hotels, shopping and sight-seeing. After learning this, you return to New Delhi. This time, you choose Kathmandu, which leads to Beijing, and from there you can go to Thimphu, where you have $400 total expenses. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination. Which city from New Delhi will lead to the path where one can find the least expensive destination?"

If you choose to go from New Delhi to Islamabad, then Kabul, and thereafter Tehran - your total expenses will be $1000. On the other hand, if you choose to go from New Delhi to Kathmandu and then continue on to Beijing and Thimphu - your total expenses will be $400 which is less than that of the other path. So, choosing Kathmandu as your starting point would lead you to the path where one can find the least expensive destination.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"

You go back to New Delhi. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the least expensive destination.

Therefore, we need to consider the two remaining paths. One path is from New Delhi to Islamabad - Kabul - Tehran with a total expense of $1000 and another path is from New Delhi to Kathmandu - Beijing - Thimphu which costs $400. Since all flights have been cancelled for traveling towards Bangkok, we can drop that route completely. So once again choosing Kathmandu as your starting point would lead you to the path where one can find the least expensive destination.\n\nAnswer: Kathmandu"
