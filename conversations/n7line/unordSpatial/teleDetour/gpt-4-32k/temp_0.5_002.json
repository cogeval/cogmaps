You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

This means Path 2 is blocked.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of flowers in the remaining paths.\nPath 1: 10 orchid flowers\nPath 3: Unknown, depends on the neighbor field of the Daisy field chosen after using the portal.\n\nStep 4: Determine the neighbor field of the Daisy field that has the maximum number of flowers.\nSince Path 2 is blocked, we cannot access the Hydrangea field (50 flowers) directly. However, the portal from the Daffodil field allows us to go to any neighbor field of the Daisy field. If the Hydrangea field is a neighbor of the Daisy field, we can still access the maximum number of flowers (50 hydrangea flowers) by choosing Path 3.\n\nStep 5: Identify the field from the entrance that leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers.\nThe lily field leads to Path 3, which allows us to access the maximum number of flowers through the portal.\n\nAnswer: Lily field"
