You enter the rose field, at the other end of this field there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, you can have 10 orchid flowers for free, but you do not take any flower, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, which has a door to the daisy field, and the daisy field has a door that leads to the hydrangea field. You can have 50 hydrangea flowers from the hydrangea field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Which field from the entrance will lead to the path with the maximum number of flowers?"

If you choose the rose field, you end up at the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field. However, you don't take any flowers from the orchid field, and you exit to start over.\n\nNext, you choose the sunflower field, which takes you to the daisy field. From the daisy field, you reach the hydrangea field, where you can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free. Again, you don't take any flowers and exit to return to the entrance.\n\nAt this point, you have explored both paths and learned about the environment. However, the sunflower field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers. This is because the sunflower field provides a direct path to the hydrangea field, where you can have 50 hydrangea flowers for free. In contrast, the rose field leads to the tulip field, which only provides a path to the orchid field, and you do not take any flowers from the orchid field. Therefore, the sunflower field offers the path with the maximum number of flowers."

The lily field leads to the peony field, which in turn leads to the daffodil field. The daffodil field has a portal that allows you to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field.\n\nSince the regular path to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, you can take an alternative path using the portal in the daffodil field. The portal allows you to go to any neighbor field of the daisy field, which includes the hydrangea field.\n\nTherefore, the rose field, which leads to the tulip field and the orchid field, provides a path that can lead to the hydrangea field through the portal in the daffodil field. This path includes the maximum number of flowers from the hydrangea field.\n\nIn summary, the rose field leads to the path with the maximum number of flowers in the given scenario."
