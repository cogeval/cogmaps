Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Path 3 allows you to know any scholar connected to Jing (including Nisha, who is connected to 50 books).\n\nStep 3: Determine which path would potentially lead to the maximum number of books considering the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked.\n\nSince the regular path (Path 2) is blocked, we need to consider Path 3, as it can lead to Jing-connected scholars and potentially allow you to reach the scholar with the maximum number of books (Nisha).\n\nStep 4: Identify which scholar Vicky can connect you with, who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books, considering the regular path is blocked.\n\nVicky can connect you with Reza, who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books through the portal.\n\nAnswer: Reza"
