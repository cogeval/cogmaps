Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"
