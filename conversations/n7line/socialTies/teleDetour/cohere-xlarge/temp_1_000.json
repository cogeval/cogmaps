Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car.

Which friend from Fatima's introductions will lead to the path where one can get the most valuable car?\n\nAs part of the problem, you are given a huge list of 10,000 distinct friends (i.e., distinct strings), which is not enough to solve the problem. In addition, you are given an N\u00d7N table where N is the number of friends Fatima knows. The table contains a value for each combination of two friends, in the format (x, y), where x and y are integers between 1 and 10,000. The value of the (x, y) pair is the value of the car x introduces to y. The value of the most valuable car is 1,000,000.\n\nNote that your answer will be correct if and only if it is in the list of N\u00d7N pairs. The order of the pairs does not matter.\n\nYour job is to find a subset of the N"
