Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

If Vicky introduces you to Wim, who is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha, who donates 50 books, you will get the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, Vicky should introduce you to Wim to lead to the path with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"

However, the regular path to Nisha is blocked, and we need to find an alternative path to reach Jing. \n\nReza is connected to Kim, who is connected to Ian, who has a portal to know any scholar connected to Jing. Therefore, to get to Jing, we need to follow the path: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Ian (through the portal) -> Kim -> Reza.\n\nSince Jing is connected to Nisha, this path leads to the maximum number of books (50).\n\nTherefore, Vicky should introduce you to Wim to lead to the path with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
