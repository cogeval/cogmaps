Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

From this portal it is possible to know any scholar connected to Jing. When you meet Vicky and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books, you discover that the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked.  You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, will lead to the path with the maximum number of books?"

Jing is connected to Wim, who is in turn connected to Raj and Raj is connected to Wei. So, we can use the portal to know about any scholar connected to Wim, Raj or Wei.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible paths:\n- Vicky --> Wim --> Raj --> Wei --> Nisha (50 books)\n- Vicky --> Wim --> Raj --> Amir --> Jing --> Nisha (40 books)\n- Vicky --> Wim --> Raj --> Wei --> Reza --> Kim --> Ian --> Jing --> Nisha (20 books)\n\nTherefore, Vicky should connect you with Wim, which will lead to Nisha who is donating 50 books, the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Wim"
