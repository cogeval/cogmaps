Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Raj introduces you to Wei, who is donating 10 books.\n2. Raj introduces you to Nisha, who is donating 50 books.\nIn this scenario, the maximum number of books you can collect is 50, which is through option 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario where Vicky introduces you to Wim. Wim is connected with Jing, who is connected with Nisha. So, the options are:\n1. Wim introduces you to Jing, who introduces you to Nisha, who is donating 50 books.\n2. Wim introduces you directly to Nisha, who is donating 50 books.\nIn both cases, the maximum number of books you can collect is 50.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Vicky can connect you with Wim, who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books. The maximum number of books you can collect is 50"
