Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

            "content": "The answer is **Jiao**.\r\n\r\nIf Vicky has a portal that allows you to meet any scholar connected to Jing, then the best scholar to choose is **Jiao**. Jiao is connected to Nisha, who donates 50 books. This means that by following the path through Jiao, you will get **50** books.\r\n\r\nThe other scholars connected to Jing are Wei and Raj. However, Wei only donates 10 books, and Raj is only connected to Wei, so the path through Wei or Raj would only give you **10** books.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best scholar to choose is Jiao, as this will give you the maximum number of books.\r\n\r\nHere is a table summarizing the three paths and the number of books you would receive:\r\n\r\n| Path | Number of books |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Jiao -> Nisha | 50 |\r\n| Wei -> Raj -> Wei | 10 |\r\n| Raj -> Wei | 10 |\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the path through Jiao gives you **40** more books than the path through Wei or Raj. Therefore, the optimal path is through Jiao.\r\n\r\nHowever, you mentioned that you are **just learning about the environment**. If this is the case, then you may want to consider the path through **Amir**. Amir is a scholar who is interested in the environment, and you may be able to learn a lot from him.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the decision of which path to take is up to you. Consider your priorities and choose the path that you think will be most beneficial to you."
