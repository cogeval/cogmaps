Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

If you follow the relations between scholars, you can start by asking Vicky to introduce you to Wim since there is a direct path between Nisha and Jing through WiM, which leads to 50 available books. However If you start asking for Jing first Wim would introdoze as no. Then Nisha introduction comes in next step in line and 5 people have been met at this introductery event. In other words if your approach path from a fixed point of this network it forms this shape W-  [VJ NJ] thus from W there's no path with as huge of books to take since N is directly to path with maximum number to J, or j then directly with J with all books available books at that node and that leads our the maximum number available is on this last point\n\n\n\nIs that correct?'\n\nVicky intro  Amir- Raj. Amir - wei   RAy - Nisha'\n\nPath I have: VIcky > Amir \nHow much do I get books from nisha if I pick a path with that book as last station from Amir and don't take it?'"
