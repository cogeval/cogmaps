Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Let me think step by step.\n\nStep 1: Vicky can introduce me to either Amir or Wim.\n\nStep 2: If I choose Amir, I will be connected to Raj, and then to Wei.\n\nStep 3: If I choose Wim, I will be connected to Jing, and then to Nisha.\n\nStep 4: Nisha is donating 50 books, but I do not take any books, I'm just learning about the environment.\n\nStep 5: Since I do not take any books, the number of books I can collect does not matter. Therefore, I should choose the path that leads to the maximum number of connections.\n\nAnswer: Vicky should introduce me to Wim, as this path leads to the maximum number of connections.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf I choose Amir, I will have two connections (Amir and Raj), but both of them do not lead to any more connections.\n\nIf I choose Wim, I will have three connections (Wim, Jing, and Nisha), and Nisha is donating 50 books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of connections is Wim."
