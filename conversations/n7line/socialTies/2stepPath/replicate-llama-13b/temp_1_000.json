Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Which scholar Vicky shall you follow his connecting pathways by choosing who between connections for an optimizable flow of highest information from each node followed. Your chosen answer, is in [A-Za-z]+ format to capture information sources followed. (Answer, [A-Za-z\\s]+ \\*[A-Za-z  \\] or [WjNV]]\nYou want to know with which other expert scholars or scholar network communities can assist knowledge growth while giving you potential or leading to wider a knowledge landscape among them. This will depend on how much you engage and share common topics for exchange to create potential learning opportunities\nHints are available if the answer needs to be expanded further or for clarification to get full details with a step by step, just comment and ask questions.
