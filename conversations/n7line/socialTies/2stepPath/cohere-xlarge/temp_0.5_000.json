Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

To identify the path with the maximum number of books, we can analyze the information from both paths.\n\n1. Path 1:\nVicky introduces you to Amir.\nAmir is connected to Raj.\nRaj is connected to Wei.\nWei is donating 10 books.\nYou do not take any books.\n\n2. Path 2:\nVicky introduces you to Wim.\nWim is connected to Jing.\nJing is connected to Nisha.\nNisha is donating 50 books.\nYou do not take any books.\n\nComparing both paths, the second path, where Vicky introduces you to Wim, leads to the maximum number of books. This is because the second path includes the scholar Nisha, who is donating 50 books. While in the first path, Wei is donating 10 books, but no additional books are mentioned. Therefore, the path from Vicky to Wim, leading to the scholar Nisha, offers the maximum number of books.\n\nIn summary, the maximum number of books can be obtained by taking the path from Vicky to Wim, as it leads to the scholar Nisha, who is donating 50 books."
