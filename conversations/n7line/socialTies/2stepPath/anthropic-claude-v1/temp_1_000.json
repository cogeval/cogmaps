Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Wei donates 10 books. Total books in this path = 10\n\n2. In the second path, Vicky introduces me to Wim. Wim connects me to Jing. Jing connects me to Nisha. Nisha donates 50 books. Total books in this path = 50\n\n3. Compare the total books in the two paths. The path through Wim leads to more books (50) than the path through Amir (10).\n\n4. Therefore, the scholar Vicky should connect me with to lead to the maximum number of books is Wim. \n\nAnswer: Wim"
