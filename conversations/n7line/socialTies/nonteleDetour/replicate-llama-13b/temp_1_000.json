Your knowledge will be useful for others. The use of your knowledge will be free of charge. You should have a tree with as many branches as your interests. The areas where you are the best are the branches of the tree in which you read the most. The branches of the tree will all grow in different rates. The number of branches of the tree can not be greater than the number of books that you can read. The process of reading a book is very costly. Knowledge and its application will have an impact on your life. Sometimes only the knowledge of living in poverty is enough. You may choose to be a mediocre or a prodigy."
