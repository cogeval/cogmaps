Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car.

However, you are not interested in taking the car, so the most valuable car is irrelevant.\n\nIn the revised problem, you meet a new friend, Mike, who directly introduces you to Julia, who has the second most valuable car in the group. Therefore, the best path to take is to ask Fatima to introduce you to **Mike**.\n\nHere are the steps involved in getting the **Ferrari**, which is the second most valuable car in the group:\n\n1. Ask Fatima to introduce you to **Mike**.\n2. Mike introduces you to **Julia**.\n3. Julia gives you the **Ferrari**.\n\n**Answer: Mike**"
