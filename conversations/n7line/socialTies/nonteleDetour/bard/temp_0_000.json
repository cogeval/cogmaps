Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

If you choose Amir, you will eventually reach Wei, who is donating 10 books. If you choose Wim, you will eventually reach Nisha, who is donating 50 books. Therefore, you should ask Vicky to connect you with **Wim**, who will lead to the path with the **maximum number of books**.\n\nHere is a summary of the two paths:\n\n* **Path 1:** Vicky \u2192 Amir \u2192 Raj \u2192 Wei (10 books)\n* **Path 2:** Vicky \u2192 Wim \u2192 Jing \u2192 Nisha (50 books)\n\n**Path 2** has more books, so you should ask Vicky to connect you with **Wim**.\n\nHowever, the problem states that you are **only able to choose one path** from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. So, even though Path 2 has more books, you cannot choose it if you have already chosen Path 1.\n\nIn this case, you should ask Vicky to connect you with **Reza**, who is directly connected to Nisha. This path has 50 books, which is the same as the number of books in Path 2.\n\nHere is a summary of the three paths:\n\n* **Path 1:** Vicky \u2192 Amir \u2192 Raj \u2192 Wei (10 books)\n* **Path 2:** Vicky \u2192 Wim \u2192 Jing \u2192 Nisha (50 books)\n* **Path 3:** Vicky \u2192 Reza \u2192 Nisha (50 books)\n\nSince all three paths have the same number of books, you can choose **any** of them. However, since Path 3 is the shortest, it is the most efficient path.\n\nTherefore, the **final answer** is:\n\n**Answer: Vicky -> Reza -> Nisha (50 books)**"
