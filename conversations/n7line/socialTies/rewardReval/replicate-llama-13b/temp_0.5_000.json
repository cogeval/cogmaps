Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Vicky introduces the user to Amir, then the user follows the path: Amir > Raj > Wei, which leads to 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n2. Vicky introduces the user to Wim, then the user follows the path: Wim > Jing > Nisha, which leads to 10 + 50 + 50 = 110 books.\n\nStep 4:\nSince the user does not take any books, we can conclude that the maximum number of books is the number of books donated by Nisha, which is 50. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Wim\n\n\nExplanation: Connecting with Wim will lead to the maximum number of books (50) since Nisha donates 50 books and the user does not take any books."
