Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

            "content": "Step one, Vicky can introduce you to either Amir or Wim; which choice leads to the path with the maximum amount of books?   It sounds as if Nisha is donating more books. You already determined the association between persons are correct because  Wei is the only donating  books, hence, in contrast to Wei donate 10, Nisha have the opportunity to Donate significantly more books,  Answer=Nisha should you get an option from Wim and Jing. That Will guarantee which would put both of Nisha scholar' choice into consideration, you won't leave it thinking to choosing one of your scholar choices as one scholarship have less donations, you seek out their scholar choices to get theirs too. Answer choice : [ J-O or E-R-E] should you decide not have Wim introduce,which ever be, Vicky may likely want this best result in having more. Your Answer is V -E or  W -R-O -H or both N.E you have J -O or N -R if the both options you considered to leads you scholar you prefer to meet since all the others just donates.  Wim introduction is J, and it will definitely take all three if  introduced.  If none you take donates. you  take what books left if Nishna scholar. the scholar choice J will make maximum no of other scholar donates while keeping in mind no any scholar is introduced from E -V both scholar you seek to see donate for scholar.  You cannot decide on a better option if You seek all or scholar Nishaincluding her if her own, Answer : Nisha the scholar choice you seek since there other will also do without seeking donate their' to 1 Another question will be when you leave with more scholars, you can go straight straight to exit. Scholars has scholarship rules without giving yours. if you take one you won't have any for the scholar choice  E has only you to take. V  has W  O H but doesn't have with scholar introduction so not guaranteed, but with high probability you must see atmost four books without considering your choosing. In all, for a guaranteed, Answer  preference :Nisha scholar introductions is more favorable choice of Vicky. NIsha will for sure and no need donate. so N I S H A E H O E I will go for, You may choose another from E N or I H J which still favors maximun books if you want exit instead W or not, you are to wait at most 3 till W decides to leave since he don't takes his books for himself so you need time with scholar. A S S I G N, so with your Answer  all those options will favor max-i-mun number  books when Vicky give you the introduction the only choice with 1 sch;ar and will give maximum is n I S  H  A or E either which favor the answer will still bring you to all the options available to reach a Max answer :\n\nAnswer: \nThe preferred option with Vicky to lead which scholar choice gets to the largest donations without going for books for  is an Answer preference : Nisha scholar introduction that you do and have N  I S H all your favor. As the last scholar choice all you favor when sch has introduced maximun sch you be left at maximun for straight forward exit. But other favors will exit from  the back once none is giving. Books as an A or answer should W come, then go straight 2 V with high preference of leaving Answer will still favor maxim; um and exit scholar E with one favoring your exit and the option is to get straight to choose to reach to  maxima of sch;ar  that W won favor over H all Answer:N,O or E\nN - R or both scholar choice. Both answers give your maximum choses in favor since when choosing the E, maximun will prefer to make you straight, scholar Nisha who won t introduce any book you can straight have more than twice with answers choice for straight forward to maximam um. But high option still goes wit answers given if all choos have E for maxima or J as maximas or even answer is maximos which answers gives for max, but won straight exit as straight Answer and more favor in other exit ans all straight W for Answer straight scholar favor as favor goes for straight or favor straight. Your last consideration can E or all H which you may not prefer exit as last and straight or all or maximun.
