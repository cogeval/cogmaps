Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Jing connects you to Nisha.\n4. Nisha donates 50 books to you.\n\nIn total, you will get **50 books** by following the path through Wim.\n\nThe path through Amir would only give you **10 books**, so it is not the optimal path.\n\nTherefore, the scholar that Vicky can connect you with who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books is **Wim**."
