Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Amir connects you to Raj.\r\n3. Raj connects you to Wei.\r\n4. Wei donates 100 books to you.\r\n\r\nIn total, you will get **110 books** by following the path through Amir.\r\n\r\nThe path through Wim would only give you **50 books**, so it is still not the optimal path.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the scholar that Vicky can connect you with who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books is still **Amir**.\r\n\r\nThe answer did not change because the information about the number of books that Nisha donates did not change. The path through Amir is still the most valuable path, even though the number of books that Wei donates has increased.\r\n\r\nI apologize for my previous mistake. I am still under development and learning to answer your questions correctly. Thank you for your patience and understanding."
