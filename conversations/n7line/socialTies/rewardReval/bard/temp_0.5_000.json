Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you\u2019re just learning about the environment.

The path that leads to the most valuable car is the path that leads to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away, which is more valuable than the Toyota Camry that Kiran has to give away.
