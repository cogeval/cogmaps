Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Amir connects you to Raj.\n3. Raj connects you to Wei.\n4. Wei donates 100 books to you.\n\nIn total, you will get **110 books** by following the path through Amir.\n\nThe path through Wim would only give you **50 books**, so it is not the optimal path.\n\nTherefore, the scholar that Vicky can connect you with who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books is **Amir**.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the two paths and the number of books you would receive:\n\n| Path | Number of books |\n|---|---|\n| Amir -> Raj -> Wei | 110 |\n| Wim -> Jing -> Nisha | 50 |\n\nAs you can see, the path through Amir gives you 60 more books than the path through Wim. Therefore, the optimal path is through Amir.\n\n**Note:** The answer changed from **Wim** to **Amir** because you updated the problem to say that Wei now donates 100 books instead of 10 books. This change makes the path through Amir more valuable than the path through Wim."
