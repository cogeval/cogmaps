Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

One path is to introduce you to Amir, who is connected with Raj, who is connected with Wei. The other path is to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, who is connected with Nisha.\n\nWith the given information, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is to be introduced to Wim. This is because Wim is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha, who is donating 50 books. This is greater than the 10 books that Wei is donating, and therefore leads to the path with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
