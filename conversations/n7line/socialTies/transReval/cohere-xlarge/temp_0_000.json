Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

One way to do this is to use a graph editor like Gephi, which allows you to easily add and remove nodes and edges. Once you have the graph set up, you can use the following steps to find the path with the maximum number of books:\n1. Use the algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Vicky to Nisha. This algorithm will find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, based on the number of edges between them.\n2. Once you have the shortest path from Vicky to Nisha, you can use the algorithm Floyd-Warshall to find the shortest path from Wim to Nisha. This algorithm will find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph, based on the number of edges between them.\n3.
