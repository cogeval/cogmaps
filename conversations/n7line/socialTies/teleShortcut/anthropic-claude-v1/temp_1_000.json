Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

I can ask Vicky to introduce me to either Amir or Wim.\n3. If Vicky introduces me to Amir, then Amir is connected to Raj. Raj is then connected to Wei. Wei will donate 10 books.\n4. If Vicky introduces me to Wim, then Wim is connected to Jing. Jing is then connected to Nisha. Nisha will donate 50 books.\n5. Since Nisha will donate 50 books which is more than Wei's 10 books, the path through Wim and Jing will lead to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"

Now there is also a portal from Vicky that can connect to any scholar connected to Jing. \n3. If I choose Amir through Vicky's direct connection, that path leads to Raj and Wei, who donates 10 books.\n4. If I choose Wim through Vicky's direct connection, that path leads to Jing and Nisha, who donates 50 books.\n5. Now considering the portal - since the portal connects to any scholar connected to Jing, and Nisha is connected to Jing, I can reach Nisha through the portal. And Nisha donates 50 books.\n\nTherefore, using the portal to reach Nisha will maximize the number of books.\n\nAnswer: Nisha"
