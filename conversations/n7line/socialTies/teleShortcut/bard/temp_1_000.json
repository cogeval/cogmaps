Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Wim connects you to Jing.\r\n3. Jing connects you to Nisha.\r\n4. Nisha donates **50** books to you.\r\n\r\nIn total, you will get **50** books by following the path through Wim.\r\n\r\nThe path through Amir would only give you **10** books, so it is not the optimal path.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the scholar that Vicky can connect you with who will lead to the path with the maximum number of books is **Wim**.\r\n\r\nThe answer changed from **Amir** to **Wim** because you updated the problem to say that Nisha now donates **50** books instead of **10** books. This change makes the path through Wim more valuable than the path through Amir.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

However, Wei only donates 10 books, and Raj is only connected to Wei, so the path through Wei or Raj would only give you **10** books.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best scholar to choose is Jiao, as this will give you the maximum number of books.\r\n\r\nHere is a table summarizing the three paths and the number of books you would receive:\r\n\r\n| Path | Number of books |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Jiao -> Nisha | 50 |\r\n| Wei -> Raj -> Wei | 10 |\r\n| Raj -> Wei | 10 |\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the path through Jiao gives you **40** more books than the path through Wei or Raj.
