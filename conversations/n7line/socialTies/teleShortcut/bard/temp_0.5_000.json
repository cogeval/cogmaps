Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car.

However, in this scenario, we are allowed to directly ask any of her friends for their cars. Since Kiran has the most valuable car (the Lamborghini), we should ask **Kiran** for their car.\n\nHowever, if we are only limited to following the introductions that Fatima gave us, then the answer is **Julia**. We would start by asking Fatima to introduce us to Robert. Then, Robert would introduce us to Nick. Nick would then introduce us to Julia, who would give us the Ferrari.\n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether we are allowed to directly ask any of Fatima's friends for their cars. If we are allowed to, then the answer is **Kiran**.
