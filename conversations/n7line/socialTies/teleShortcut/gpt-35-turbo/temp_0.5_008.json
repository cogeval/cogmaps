Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

Raj is connected to Wei, so he is also donating 10 books. Amir is connected to Raj, so he is donating 10+10=20 books.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of books we can get through Wim, Jing, and Nisha. As Nisha is donating 50 books, we want to choose this path. Wim is connected to Jing, so he is not donating any books.\n\nTherefore, Vicky should connect us with Wim, who is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha, who is donating the maximum number of books (50). \n\nAnswer: Wim"
