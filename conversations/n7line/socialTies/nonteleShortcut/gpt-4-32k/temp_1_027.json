Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car. Which friend from Fatima's introductions will lead to the path where one can get the most valuable car?"
