Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

This is because the path through Wim gives you **50** books, while the path through Amir only gives you **10** books.\r\n\r\nHere is the step-by-step process for the path through Wim:\r\n\r\n1. Vicky introduces you to **Wim**.\r\n2. **Wim** introduces you to **Jing**.\r\n3. **Jing** introduces you to **Nisha**.\r\n4. **Nisha** donates **50** books to you.\r\n\r\nIn total, you will get **50** books by following the path through **Wim**.\r\n\r\nThe path through **Amir** would only give you **10** books, so it is not the optimal path.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!"
