Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car. Which friend from Fatima's introductions will lead to the path where one can get the most valuable car?"

In that case, the most valuable car in the group is irrelevant, and you can choose any of Fatima's friends to introduce you to.\n\n**Answer: Any of Fatima's friends**\n\nIn the revised problem, you discover that the friendship leading to the most valuable car is over. However, this does not change the fact that Kiran still has the Lamborghini. Therefore, you can still **ask Krishna to introduce you to Kiran**.\n\n**Answer: Kiran**"
