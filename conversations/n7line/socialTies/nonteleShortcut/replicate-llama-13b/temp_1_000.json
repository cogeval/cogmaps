Ana introduces you to Sophie, who introduces you to Kiran. Kiran has a Toyota Camry to give away. You do not take the car, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. Then you start over with Fatima introducing you to Robert, who introduces you to Nick, and Nick introduces you to Julia. Julia has a Ferrari to give away. You do not take the car, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable car. Which friend from Fatima's introductions will lead to the path where one can get the most valuable car?"

Which of your friends does this lead to? Kiran, who has a Toyota Camry to give away.\n\nIn a nutshell, the challenge is an adventure game where the user goes through the starting state and one path leads to the Toyota Camry and another leads to the Ferrari. You are presented with the start, a connection, and two possible targets, and you are supposed to go through and find the correct target and provide all intermediate connections.\n\n\textbf{Reminder:} You are only allowed to write one path that leads to the Toyota Camry, you\u2019re not supposed to write two paths. The one you provide is the one that starts from the chosen starting state."
