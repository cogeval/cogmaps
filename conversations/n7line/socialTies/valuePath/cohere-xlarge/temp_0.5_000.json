Amir is connected with Raj, and Raj is connected with Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time you ask Vicky to introduce you to Wim, who is connected with Jing, and Jing is connected with Nisha. Nisha is donating 50 books, but you do not take any books, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books. Which scholar can Vicky connect you with, who will lead to the path with maximum number of books?"

This means that the path leading to the maximum number of books starts with Nisha, who is donating 50 books. To maximize the number of books, it is crucial to find the path with the highest number of books. Since there are no books being taken, the path must include a series of scholars connected to Nisha, starting with Jing. Jing is connected to Wim, who is connected to Amir. From there, the path leads to Raj, who is connected to Wei. Wei is donating 10 books, which is the minimum number of books donated by any of the scholars. This path includes a total of 60 books, which is the maximum number of books donated by any of the scholars. The path that leads to the maximum number of books can be found by following the series of connections between the scholars, starting with Nisha and ending with Wei. The number of books donated by each scholar in the path can be counted to determine the total number of books donated. This path includes a total of 60 books, which is the maximum number of books donated by any of the scholars. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starts with Nisha and includes a series of scholars connected to her, including Jing, Wim, Amir, Raj, and Wei."
