You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

It might be beneficial to restart Round 2 again so as to discover another possible higher money room on round 3 (experiment with lobby ->room 3 --> room6 chest, to eventually discover pathway for most money from lobby itself in a round trip). Note: When restarting in second or later stage, you should also factor which other (connected) rooms with respective money amounts still unknown. Thus, potential second restart will be more precise to the room that may net the highest cash:  room 5 versus any rooms other than it which may also ultimately add to your winning stash. Therefore, round and round till you make it. Good luck and enjoy. *wink wink.*"
