You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

Therefore, the new path that leads to the most money is Room 3.\n\nHere is the revised path:\n\n* **Room 3:** Leads to Room 5, which contains a chest with **100 dollars**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **Room 3**.\n\nHere is the regular expression that you wanted me to use:\n\n```\nAnswer: [Rr]oom [0-9]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression will match any string that starts with the word \"Answer\", followed by the word \"Room\", followed by a number from 1 to 9.
