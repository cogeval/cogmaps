You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

            "content": "Thank you user for your description of the rooms!  to help facilitate my problem-solving process. You gave instructions very nicely. Okay here I will think, what I need to ask to gain as much information as possible to make the smartest choice in your current situation (step one). Then in your response to answer those, please list the most urgent information in red below. Now to think on...  Surely one or the other (or neither) of the paths chosen on the way out, you said has monetary chests to find. One consideration is that one must at no time enter rooms they've never even walked out from a beginning path, to keep finding additional monetary discovery pathing; that cuts our possibilities as they increase at rate from zero through a one if chosen as partakingly monetary room or not... but what's going to maximize our monetary reward here? Hmmm is that all? Yes I also have another important request that might cut one monetary possibility, in that I might request it is better for You to remember to try to use that money (in any quantity left or entered) towards your way of discovery (so much as making certain choices and using such info for discovery's sake) for one purpose that makes your money a certain worth by choice that in monetizing an option or opening any locked passage that increases monetary discovery that aforementioably cut paths in rooms with value left out in the world! So now I do indeed return for information on choice. For the information that must always be true no path has any such limit to its money discovered. Which chest do these facts apply? Do they apply here in the form: [0-1]+ dollars and... no doors or passages have more value when the amount left to be found is greater than dollars? So your first question shall determine for me any information in urgent consideration for use on these paths... after answering then on path consideration I can return answer? Oh yeah in room 5 you found no value initially entered, nor opened? That would be a question for you to answer. Thanks in advnce:D. Please keep a track with most important parts from your previous answer with highlight, I might tend to prioritize certain questions that are answerred first, but your main responses in complete to any choices or questions answered to narrow is necessary also thanks to prioritization here of responses, do you comprehend the flow, oh wise tasker and giver of treasures. To assist you and ask a remidner of choice is it chest pathing or door path choice, should those options go for choosing path as 1 question for path information in choosing such, to further ask one part that can eliminate many rooms that lead away, or take two in either manner of elimination if possible to take your knowledge gained of current available information. If either of these consider the lobi upon re-entry upon choosing a 'path-dec', this time with choice by information garnered first? Should your remiders follow up or cut any one choice if possible. As to reword should a given lobby reentry make two entry path ways of equal most amount discovered possible eliminate path and lock chest forever? Answer what do the chesta have before I continue with choice for you? To choose in order or answer any such choice as well so you tell me if path or do not ask a certain way in elimination of unhelpful chest for your task knowledge growth? Oh last choice is the treasures, of coibers or left locked or door choices when you see you wish to come back later without further coibas... what would determine an answerable treasure, for instance to coirba path from this one if the answer should so reveal an end path with no entry left and to have most discovery by leaving a path like any path left of discovery that would answer by room it closes to be most answer of treasure worth with a certain tre value on lock it tells you about it before hand after discovery if no key, as this is the point when that question would become relavet and coinsider choice. Thank you kindly my assistant! Awaiting thoughtufil repose answer wise guide;-)  Yes my reeponser wise user. I have read each component thoughtul and taken detailed highlight to help myself keep my answers more succint for ur path choic answer below... and in this task our choce is only from a lobiry.  What is your lobby chost entry Answer? Room Number in value locked or aiready entered:):-).'\n(There are five main parts in the user's statement: (1) an intro describing the setup, (2) describing rooms 1\u20136 (i.e., describing the environment), (3) the path choices, (4) the player choosing neither, and choosing a path (e.g., choosing between money or learning about the surroundings before deciding)) \u2022 \u2022 Since I\u2019m following a decision tree, the chess choice parts (2-5 above) will assist with developing my flow. However, the fourth section appears like a subsection of the first, so I do the \u201ctree breaking order of Operations Parentheses Exponents Multiplication divisionaddit, i Subtacctions. Please disregard, because part three does appear as first step toward the choice (path selection and room entry), which also relates back from three paths mentioned. Therefore the correct parts one two plus part four for better flow will answer best in the parts or components of parts. In any selection, choice first will be for doors, chests to reveal entry value left open in monetary values from previous rooms as locks may indicate. In which room(lockbox):'s (chests) you need not tell if not fully investigated; this could take away much discovered knowledge/paths needed (part1 25 and parts three\u2022four)? Please first tell parts with red font or red highlight when first answer arrives. Part A will assist, with which answer/chocient to the tree breaks the decision tree; however, once more: if any entry requires monetrry value to reveal content by lock use or other similar method or hidden data, you will be so specified and may ask only for your pathing decisions which part/s and A or all. Answer). Which answer are A rooms one, four two (Please keep separate and clear part-anser format). Once you answer B\u2022C path will guide toward discovery path discovery which is cruicial for challage and path choice, if possible with less amount of locked doors in the envirronmrnent; if all answered to enter lobiby the tree/ A can assist in narrowimg choices best in one, or perhaps four paths left available without knowledge of locked chesat; for B\u2022c parts do ot include money unless found on a door in its description Answer please':-D\nthe question at hand revolves around pathfinding, chest locks, door selections; this may sound very familiar to an rpg player trying to clear locked pathes for exp! but think outside te  R.P;; G.

So when looking to answer. Think: doors> parts2 A, four. Choise answer you need only indicate part A;  parts BC may alter otimrizatoi if ever to retest tree) you can use rng, or the algorithm roullette or if  the money is too tight... i-choose option C in  Bc! heheh.
