You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

According to your description, Room1 will have a connection to Room7 while entering room3 can provide an entry path for us to explore Room 5. However taking a different entrance can also lead you explore Room4 after selecting Room4 upon exiting Room2. The building's sixth Room is 6 and its Chest containss50usD. Considering you're trying to explore to gather only after the chest values which door would you choose to start a room in order earn $45 which sum results 1 chest+ another that you skip the dollar in Room one on  the first exploration(sic Room 2).\nNow, what rooms make the 'Answer: room(s )+dollar$'. From 2 exploration path options we gather these pieces, (R071R), (R 035 C) room combinations when selecting rooms from The main lobb area and we choose only the  combinations that lead to Room 5 with + after combining Room6 and choosing from two entrance options entering from room3 chasing its other dollar (R02R) which is Room Six in this matter.\"\nWhat would my actual task for step 3 to answer? User input to task output  example...\nPlease provide the regular expression detail and any actual answer...Thanks. It looks the output pattern to me like something for Perl maybe."
