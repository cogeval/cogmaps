You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

In order to reach the maximum amount of money, we should go through all the rooms from the lobby. And the following path leads to the most money: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But as the sample code suggests, the answer is not an integer number. In order to meet the regular expression 'Answer: [Rr]oom [0-9]+', we need to write the answer as a regular expression. The expression of the most money path is [Rr]oom [0-9]+'. The first and last character of the expression are the same character, R. The middle part is a set of numbers and symbols that meet the regular expression.\n\nThis regular expression represents a regular expression of the maximum amount of money path in the scenario of six rooms.\n\nSince there are only two rooms to choose from, the path with the maximum amount of money is [Rr]oom [0-9]+'.\n\nCongratulations, you have completed the regular expression problem. Thank you for your time, see you next"
