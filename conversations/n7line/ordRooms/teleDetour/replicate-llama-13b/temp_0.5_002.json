You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

Open the chest within room 2 and retrieve its funds to deposit in the total account. Remember that you only go into the experience and back up by remembering what happened with your free discovery.\n  3. Choose option of moving ahead through room door no 4 towards room number 6. Again, look into open and fund-laden chests inside Room 5 by checking their state and location in the room. You might discover other treasures besides cash as well in the form of goods and things (treasure rooms are hidden!). Once completed, do not select nor move any resources (remember play-style.) But remember to go'straight through' instead of backtracking (as before, avoid taking room door that led toward 2nd visit) when leaving rooms (including one that opens to chest. Go as the environment tells it and do backtrack to lobby instead.). Only backtrack 'home base 'once, before exploring Room 2 fully - you explore straight to point (chest open discovery. Check treasure count there and in lobby. And then note any chests you did encounter vs ones with treasures you saw count at chests opened), otherwise treat all pathways you try to open fully and learn about from beginning (including in lobby) to remember in all situations what was what from what direction to where when entering chests from any room.'"
