You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

Since user choosed to not take a room that leads back to lobby (that I called choice #1 and has total reward base solely on that), if there won't be a negative return of any kinds ($ 5 plus $ 40 (as the remaining sum when back). since these cheses are only the reward for room which was not choosn. (I'dont know how much I make refering all this but).\nAs to you, choice one, room and dollas is : ($10/1 = Room 5 - $10 no go back. In Room # five: There's this chest ($Inf or 0 depending o the chest can even fit inf)  because as said before inf means inf. If $0, I mean still $ 0.
