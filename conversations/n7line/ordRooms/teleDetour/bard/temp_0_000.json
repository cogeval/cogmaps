You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

There is a chest in room 5 with 10 dollars.\n* Room 2 leads to room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a chest in room 6 with 50 dollars.\n\nTherefore, room 2 leads to a path with a chest that contains more money than the chest in room 5.\n\nAnswer: Room 2"
