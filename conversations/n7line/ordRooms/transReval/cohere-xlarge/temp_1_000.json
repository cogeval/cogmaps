You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

We will assume the following:\n\nNext, you will create a main class, CubeQueens, which has a static main method that will receive a parameter, a, for the number of queens.\n\nInside of the main method, you will have an array, board, which will be filled with empty cubes (cubes will have x, y, and z values, but will be empty). The initial size of the board will be 15 x 15 x 15, which will be passed into the main method via the parameter a.\n\nNext, you will create a function, cube, which will take the cube x, y, z values and assign a queen to the cube.\n\nFinally, you will create a function, nextCube, which will take the coordinates of the cube in the array and return the next cube in the array.\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
