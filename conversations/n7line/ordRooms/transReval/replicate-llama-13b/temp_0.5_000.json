You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

To analyze this effectively, let's think of it in steps to determine  the answer.\n Step1; What are the options available to you as stated  in the given scenario and which room will directly  connect us\nThe given information indicates; you're standing at the lobbies entrance'\nroom 1 directly ahead\nroom 9 directly ahead\n\nThe direct information as of when last seen in order to make headway isn't stating we had  or can go direct  from 3,4,5, or from  6 and make to room one, hence disqualifying a chance at going to room eight to return us to the beginning. Therefore considering, the given scenario. The direct options we stand available and from these starting points, choose your ideal way leading to direct financial potential. Your available  starting point at ground zero and options and paths considering financial potential  considering not just any direct route would we pick. Foremost, is to determine available, possible options. Your direct accessible options to you from and to determine direct financial  or non financial risks, the given or described scenareen doesn't suggest you can not enter or walk pass room. The rules described only that from a point of having reached them and they point that leads one not to leave back behind certain room prior taking that certain turn. Now in regards, let's determine a course most probable to room with chests most financially appealing since this directly plays  to financial or economic gain as it would seem and the way to go financially wise,\nAnnwer:  Room \nWhile determining the financial appeal from any position, going forward consider an option that you had in the least gone thrughs direct rooms (not going backwards via turning around or detouring th rough other areas to include the risked detours from  directly considered possible turning areas) and thus, going forward a step wise into direct areas\nOne approach or option is through Room one  that when taken, if one would choose doors after passing into room Two."
