You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

The number of characters will be the shortest word's length.\n\nFinally, it will create a sentence with the two words, separated by a space and the number of the shortest word's length.\n\nFor this solution, you will use the longest and shortest words. However, the minimum and maximum lengths of the shortest and longest words are not mentioned. So, it's important to find the minimum and maximum lengths for the shortest and longest words.\n\nSo, the minimum length of the longest word is 2 and the maximum length of the longest word is 6. The minimum length of the shortest word is 1 and the maximum length of the shortest word is 3.\n\nSince the maximum length of the longest word is 6, it will look for the longest word that is less than or equal to 6.\n\nFor the shortest word, it will check if the shortest word is 1, then look for the longest"
