I need to write a script that does the following:\n\n  1. I enter the number of days, and the program finds the date of the last working day of the month.\n  2. I enter the number of days, and the program finds the date of the first working day of the next month.\n  3. I enter the number of days, and the program finds the date of the first and last working days of the next month.\n\nAnswer:\n\n## 14.3 Implementing Backtracking\n\nBefore you implement backtracking, let's have a look at the program. This is the same program you implemented in Chapter 13. We will change it to add the new functionality.\n\nIn Chapter 13, you learned how to design programs. This section is a continuation of Chapter 13 and will cover how to implement the design.\n\n### 14.3.1 The program design\n\nYou learned in Chapter 13 that the program should"
