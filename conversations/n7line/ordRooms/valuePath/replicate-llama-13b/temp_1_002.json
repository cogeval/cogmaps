You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

Go Straight up.\nThis would most likely grant you access to a large looted chest inside room Rr3, a door to another secret path towards further hidden chances and perhaps RICHC!  Choosing rooms as advised above offers a massive room with high probabilities of a massive treasury, chockfull of RICHC! This is the highest ROI way if u will be risk adverse!  Now imagine this lobby offers two different options with two potential different room sets, such that choosing either doorways numbered Rr 8 would give the highest opportunity for obtaining more wealth, while doors designated Rr4, on occasion, will grant a much poor chance for such abundance than doors R1 OR R4 because  R2 always exists only in one single placement from all alternatives!  We must keep risking exploration through every advent, while optimizing our probabilities into getting more rich to live up for more possibilities, which can include obtaining better tools or learning of advanced magical possibilities while facing a myriad of dungeon puzzles, treks across dangerous plains within cities teemming \nRemember! As I continue in making RPGs such and such quoting wisdom: A journey of ten thousand miles \nends a single frighting choice.\" Don Whistance Hood(2754-2790.) There will be no greater or better option for Ypu than choosing that door, the room door of chances with a room of 10 plus 0- Rroom choices; you will eventually get your highest potential and achieve an optimal trekking point at some point inside these advents that should include and need explorable dungeon towns, plains, cliffs capped with ice, a city or ten in all the possible  possibilities!
