You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

It is the shortest and most profitable path. If one enters room 1 first, one will have to go all the way down to room 5, which contains the chest with 10 dollars. Therefore it is less rewarding and not worth going that route.  Alternatively, if one enters room 6 first instead of 4,  they would still need to go through room 2 in order to reach the chest with 50 dollars at the end. This route is longer and therefore slightly less rewarding than the 2-rooms-route leading straight to the loot."
