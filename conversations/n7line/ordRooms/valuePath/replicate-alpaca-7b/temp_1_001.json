You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

This is true because while entering Room 1, there is a connection from that room with a passage leading to Room 3, which in turns leads to Room 5 (containing money). Entering Room 2 only lead into Room 4 and subsequently Room 6 which has the highest amount of money. After going through Room 2, 4 is the shortest path with greatest amount of cash, thereby leading the player the farthest on the path to money.Room 3 lead players to two rooms.Room 2 connects to Room 4. Thus going by the same rule, players can deduce going in Room 2 has the optimal path to maximize rewards. Therefore going to Room 1, or Room 4 will lead players down the correct path with the greatest wealth gain. Therefore the Answer is 4."
