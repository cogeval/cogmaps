You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

The most money can be made by visiting each of the six rooms - once per visit to the buildings - to retrieve the chests with 10 and 50 dollars, to get 60 total."

As in the previous choice, visiting the same rooms multiple times leads to a full exploration of the building for potential high returns, and the most efficient path to take is repeating the room 2 door multiple times. After visiting room 7, one could either use the old approach with additional repetitions of room 2,or change to a new door in one of the side buildings, with new potential paths leading to different room numbers in the end. Changing buildings and trying new strategies is always another option on the game.  Thus the answer to the present given is that choosing Room 2 in the lobby, leading up to Room 7 which then is the exit path. In the given six equal rooms leading off from one common lobby space one may opt for the best potential returns through exploration and revisiting for a full investigation, until all coin options (total of 40) added lead to making the 100 dollars!"
