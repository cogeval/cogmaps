You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

There's a branch of rooms that leads to more money, so going in either direction would increase your likelihood of finding more. Going left will lead to rooms 3 to 6, going right will lead to rooms 1 and 2, and there's also a chance of reaching both. Choosing right from the start gives you the highest likelihood of 10 more dollars so it is best to start there. In this case, following the path right at the lobby of  rooms 1,2,3 to room 5 is the fastest route to make the most amount of money."
