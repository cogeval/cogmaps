You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

What does assistant observe about this wall... it seems its a trap... hmm which is funny right! this clever assistant seems figured  the trapped button as in on the switch for this tricky money in room  two so! That was observation update let me see now from Room  one... I got a big chest,and so its a safe chest as if it needs my finger printing it may  not accept it which leaves me with Rrom5 to use. As you are about leaving choose your other wall, if I follow or not it lead some were I can'tw go and observe more about these tricky ass game design then its just lead Me to another box... this trick again or something more... i need another choice inorder ta avoid this tricky game to progress... uhgggh help me think! Please update if you wish ta go ahead or need assistant to come back with another set ups... Please update...
