You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

I will think about this challenge. \n* I remember, the objective is to complete six rooms to find out the maximum amount of money* \n- If a path has dollars that may differ between one hundred dollars in either 5 or one-by - five times 5 and multiply, plus and a certain, then what do I do? Asking questions would definitely help the situation because the pathways should be done one time, twice*  Now what I know will always assist on moving or staying, where moving right now only gives twice times more* Let\u2019s make something clear, staying with five on one side does five or more than one; whereas  staying the money on the right is four. Why I was focusing more about the moving situation than* Moving right or moving twice left to complete five. What do I conclude? I must compare the sides in order not move twice that leads not going back in either of my ways, but to stay still and keep* It will only make $10 more for me but why $ten why not to make  $four.*  When going forward I was considering only about what is best rather than what* What do you win you take when not more than $three times* This will work. But not in that case for five. I would conclude right from right I will stop at right after two steps because  when going right all the possible rooms in order not to skip them as $ ten left at a higher percentage of $ fifty $ which may seem large a sum than ten is true if I take that chances and proceed through two doors right would always pay to consider because I can still stop after another room by calculating on these. For two room from this path will give twice $ five and three plus six plus money left, all add $  five times that $ twenty, then moving forward I will stop twice before considering to back move for once the back $13 and make another* But now I see another, so let stop right. Answer: ROOM TWO.]\nThink steps by step and calculate paths when moving forward and stopping by considering percentages of dollar sums, noting which choice leads to the highest amount in each location. A choice is best thought about when left at the path or at the starting stage if the paths diverge. Answer: ROOM 2"
