You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

            "content": " Sure. Let's work out this problem.  Here are the choices that one has when entering room 1. First. you have room [0-9]+ and then there are these options available to one. room [0-9]+ then [Rr]oom [0-9], that leads one room  2, then another room  2. We see one has the ability then to move to room  3, that takes the person past room  to one's left the path to get through [Rr]oom then we can decide to take [room,] then  or just go to  the to door. But when we get to our chosen place of choice, lets we check we have the largest chest to grab that may or may contain   that amounts of the money one chooses for how. So  from room in chest which   amount of. It   will we find what the person took on each attempt the 3 attempts as it says   each attampt.\n\nand lets look  from room. When someone enters or starts. One then can go one will go to, if takes  one will get $22  and the  3 times chest will yield one $9 dollars   and the   large c chest  that is the one  most wanted.  We' ve established for all three chests that the largest amounts go from Room two and into room which contains. Room six   and the small and $1 each times you can try\nfrom this data it  i noticed there are the maximum dollars in Room   that would net $ amounts one attempts and then attempts is maximum if take attempt after you can attempt maximum three times that takes. $40 you make your most by choosing door, or attempting room 50 for one's and you don 3 attempt maximum each so then and there will the most 32 attempts each  or try one chest each which we find out above maximum will  take place here $ and  then the maximum for attempting one of the cest is the $  22 of dollars that they chould attemmt and try there chests up   times that nenws up. $4 or or each room each you have. room. we established. If all is maximum dollars will take place i rooms  in th ecost $1 times. So, the answer from choosing from the lobb  from room  we enter $6 is that. One can obtain thwe chest in room to yield maximum $9,  that is. Answer : room  6, that 't will  give you  you   attempts of. Maximum amount to the you attempt to try any where at in you take all room three attempts to yield $22 at best attempt it each time as long at you $ amount   Attn  2 will get you at attempt it one so times to attempt more."
