You enter room 1, at the other end of room 1 there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There's a chest in room 5. You open it and there's 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, which has a door to room 4, and room 4 has a door that leads to room 6. You find a chest with 50 dollars in room 6, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

It would not bring in some income as in Step 2-4 in one choice to go in and the chestr will carry some sum on a bigger quantity compared to steps that I could pick. There wouldn't some money to bring income that exceed that of money in choosing first room that wouldn't have greater paying. And therefore that room wouldn't fit my condition/conclusion that should not consider since i wont enter and make something that have the greater amount of funds. Next I want to move and follow my next room from entrance options which is to check out if having great fund of money. The door I would want and hope can produce bigger sum is door number room 2 that contains door number 4, that contains greater monay in compare to other. Therefore to begin the quest with having most mouny I can be having inside doors, rooms by chieving all these rooms and its money before concluding. The very beginning place i would step would begin  Room \nFinal: It may  would fit the task to choose Room nber 2. Why, I've examene each and every single step, then room# 4 at your left which would make my outcome: 'Answer: Room Number 2'.\nAnd by these statement. The other choice rooms cannot get chosen, since they just lead back for just to return back, without finding money, room2 left that would grant any other door as room that would work in progress which brings me straightly ti get answare for the final to be ansera to win is best with the largest number so in a choice this might do so'.
