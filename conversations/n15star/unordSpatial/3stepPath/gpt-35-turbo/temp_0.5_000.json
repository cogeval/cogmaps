Rose Field -> Lily Field\n2. Lily Field -> Chrysanthemum Field\n3. Chrysanthemum Field -> Poppy Field\n4. Poppy Field -> Daisy Field\n5. Daisy Field -> Lavender Field\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the lavender field is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy, Lavender"
