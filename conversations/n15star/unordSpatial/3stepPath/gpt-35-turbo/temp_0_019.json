Start at the poppy field.\n2. Check its connections: lily, chrysanthemum, daisy, and lavender fields.\n3. Add the connected fields to a queue.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (lily field).\n5. Check its connections: chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n6. Add the connected fields to the queue.\n7. Take the first field from the queue (chrysanthemum field).\n8. Check its connections: poppy field.\n9. Add the connected field to the queue.\n10. Take the first field from the queue (poppy field).\n11. Check its connections: lily, chrysanthemum, daisy, and lavender fields.\n12. Since the marigold field is not among the connected fields, remove the poppy field from the queue.\n13. Take the next field from the queue (lily field).\n14. Check its connections: chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n15. Add the connected fields to the queue.\n16. Take the next field from the queue (chrysanthemum field).\n17.
