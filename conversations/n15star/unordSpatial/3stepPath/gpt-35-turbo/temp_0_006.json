Start at the lily field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the lily field: chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (chrysanthemum field).\n5. Check its neighboring fields: lily field, poppy field, and daisy field.\n6. Since the lily field has already been visited, we skip it.\n7. Add the unvisited neighboring fields (poppy field and daisy field) to the queue.\n8. Take the next field from the queue (poppy field).\n9. Check its neighboring fields: lily field, chrysanthemum field, daisy field, and carnation field.\n10. Since the lily field and chrysanthemum field have already been visited, we skip them.\n11. Add the unvisited neighboring fields (daisy field and carnation field) to the queue.\n12.
