Start at the poppy field.\n2. Check the connections of the poppy field. It is connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields (rose, lily, chrysanthemum, and daisy) to a queue.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (rose field).\n5. Check the connections of the rose field. It is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n6. Add the neighboring fields (lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation) to the queue.\n7. Take the first field from the queue (lily field).\n8. Check the connections of the lily field. It is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n9. Add the neighboring fields (chrysanthemum and poppy) to the queue.\n10. Take the first field from the queue (chrysanthemum field).\n11. Check the connections of the chrysanthemum field. It is connected to the poppy field.\n12. Add the neighboring field (poppy) to the queue.\n13. Take the first field from the queue (poppy field).\n14. Check the connections of the poppy field. It is connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field. However, we have already visited these fields, so we skip them.\n15. Take the next field from the queue (carnation field).\n16. Check the connections of the carnation field. It is connected to the zinnia field.\n17. We have reached the zinnia field.\n\nThe shortest path from the poppy field to the zinnia field is: poppy, chrysanthemum, carnation, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Poppy, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Zinnia"
