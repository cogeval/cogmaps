It is connected to the poppy field. \n\nFrom the poppy field, we find that it is connected to the carnation field. \n\nMoving on to the carnation field, we see that it is connected to the zinnia field. \n\nFinally, from the zinnia field, we can reach the hydrangea field. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the lily field to the hydrangea field is: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Hydrangea.\n\nAnswer: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Hydrangea."
