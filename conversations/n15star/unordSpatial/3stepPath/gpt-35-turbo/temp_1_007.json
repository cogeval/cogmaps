However, we have already visited the lily field, so we skip this connection.\nStep 3: From the poppy field, the connected fields are the lily field, the chrysanthemum field, and the daisy field.\nStep 4: From the daisy field, the connected fields are the lily field, the chrysanthemum field, the poppy field, and the lavender field.\nStep 5: From the lavender field, the connected fields are the daffodil field, the marigold field, and the hydrangea field.\nStep 6: From the marigold field, we have reached our destination.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the lily field to the marigold field is: Lily, Poppy, Daisy, Lavender, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Lily, Poppy, Daisy, Lavender, Marigold"
