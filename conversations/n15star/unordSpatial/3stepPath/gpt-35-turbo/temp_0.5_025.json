It is connected to the peony field, which is already in our path. \n\nMoving on, we check the connections of the peony field. It is connected to the zinnia field, which is already in our path. \n\nNext, we check the connections of the carnation field. It is not directly connected to the lily field, so we move on. \n\nMoving on, we check the connections of the orchid field. It is not directly connected to the lily field either. \n\nFinally, we check the connections of the lily field. It is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the lily field is: Sunflower, Peony, Zinnia, Lily.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Peony, Zinnia, Lily"
