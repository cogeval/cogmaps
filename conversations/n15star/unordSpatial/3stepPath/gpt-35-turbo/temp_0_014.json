Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\n- Poppy field: Connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n- Rose field: Connected to the poppy field.\n- Lily field: Connected to the rose field, daisy field, and chrysanthemum field.\n- Chrysanthemum field: Connected to the rose field, lily field, poppy field, and daisy field.\n- Daisy field: Connected to the poppy field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and lavender field.\n- Sunflower field: Connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Orchid field: Connected to the sunflower field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Peony field: Connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Carnation field: Connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, peony field, and zinnia field.\n- Zinnia field: Connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, peony field, and carnation field.\n- Hydrangea field: Connected to the tulip field, daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- Tulip field: Connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n- Daffodil field: Connected to the hydrangea field, tulip field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- Marigold field: Connected to the hydrangea field, tulip field, daffodil field, and lavender field.\n- Lavender field: Connected to the hydrangea field, daisy field, daffodil field, and marigold field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the poppy field to the sunflower field using a breadth-first search algorithm.\n\nStarting from the poppy field, we can follow the connections to the sunflower field:\n\n1. Poppy field -> Sunflower field\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the poppy field to the sunflower field is:\n\nAnswer: Poppy, Sunflower"
