Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue in the order they were checked.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the peony field is found.\n5. If the peony field is found, return the path from the rose field to the peony field.\n\nUsing this approach, the shortest path from the rose field to the peony field is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Peony"
