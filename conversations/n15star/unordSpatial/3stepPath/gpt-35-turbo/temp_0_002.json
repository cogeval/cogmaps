Start at the lily field.\n2. From the lily field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and daisy field.\n3. From the daisy field, we can go to the lavender field.\n4. From the lavender field, we can go to the marigold field.\n5. From the marigold field, we can go to the daffodil field.\n6. From the daffodil field, we can go to the hydrangea field.\n7. From the hydrangea field, we can go to the sunflower field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the lily field to the sunflower field is: Lily, Daisy, Lavender, Marigold, Daffodil, Hydrangea, Sunflower.\n\nAnswer: Lily, Daisy, Lavender, Marigold, Daffodil, Hydrangea, Sunflower."
