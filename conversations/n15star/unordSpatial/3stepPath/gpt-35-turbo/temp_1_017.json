Poppy field -> Lily field\n2. Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field\n3. Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field\n4. Chrysanthemum field -> Rose field (not a direct connection to hydrangea)\n5. Poppy field -> Daisy field (not a direct connection to hydrangea)\n6. Poppy field -> Carnation field\n7. Carnation field -> Zinnia field (not a direct connection to hydrangea)\n8. Poppy field -> Sunflower field (not a direct connection to hydrangea)\n9. Poppy field -> Tulip field (not a direct connection to hydrangea)\n10. Tulip field -> Hydrangea field\n\nBased on the connections above, the shortest path from the poppy field to the hydrangea field is: Poppy field, Tulip field, Hydrangea field.\n\nAnswer: Poppy field, Tulip field, Hydrangea field"
