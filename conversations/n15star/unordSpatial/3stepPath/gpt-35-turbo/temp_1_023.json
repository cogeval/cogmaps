Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Check its connected fields: orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n3. Add the connected fields to a queue in the order of their connection.\n4. Take the first field from the queue and check its connected fields.\n5. If the daffodil field is found among the connected fields, we have found the shortest path.\n6. Otherwise, add the connected fields to the queue and continue to the next field in the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the daffodil field is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from the sunflower field to the daffodil field: \n\nSunflower, orchid, peony, daffodil\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, orchid, peony, daffodil"
