Starting from the carnation field, we can see that it is connected to the zinnia field.\n2. From the zinnia field, we can follow the connection to the peony field.\n3. Moving from the peony field, we can reach the orchid field.\n4. Continuing from the orchid field, we can go to the sunflower field.\n5. From the sunflower field, we can reach the poppy field.\n6. Moving from the poppy field, we can go to the daisy field.\n\nSo, the shortest path from the carnation field to the daisy field is: Carnation, Zinnia, Peony, Orchid, Sunflower, Poppy, Daisy.\n\nAnswer: Carnation, Zinnia, Peony, Orchid, Sunflower, Poppy, Daisy."
