Start at the lily field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the lily field: chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Mark the lily field as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the orchid field is found.\n6. If the orchid field is found, the shortest path has been determined.\n\nUsing the given information, let's perform the BFS algorithm:\n\nStarting from the lily field, the neighboring fields are the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. We add them to the queue.\n\nQueue: [chrysanthemum field, poppy field]\nVisited: [lily field]\n\nNext, we check the chrysanthemum field. The neighboring fields connected to the chrysanthemum field are the lily field, poppy field, and carnation field. However, the lily field has already been visited, so we skip it. We add the poppy field and carnation field to the queue.\n\nQueue: [poppy field, carnation field]\nVisited: [lily field, chrysanthemum field]\n\nNext, we check the poppy field. The neighboring fields connected to the poppy field are the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field. However, the lily field and chrysanthemum field have already been visited, so we skip them. We add the daisy field to the queue.\n\nQueue: [carnation field, daisy field]\nVisited: [lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field]\n\nNext, we check the carnation field. The neighboring fields connected to the carnation field are the rose field, sunflower field, and orchid field. We found the orchid field, so we stop the BFS algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path from the lily field to the orchid field is:\n\nAnswer: lily field, carnation field, orchid field"
