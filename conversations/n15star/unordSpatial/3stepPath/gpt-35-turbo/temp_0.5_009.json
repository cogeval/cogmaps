We will continue this process until we reach the orchid field.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start at the chrysanthemum field.\n2. Explore the neighboring fields: poppy field.\n3. Explore the neighboring fields of the poppy field: lily field, daisy field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field.\n4. Explore the neighboring fields of the lily field: chrysanthemum field, poppy field.\n5. Explore the neighboring fields of the daisy field: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, lavender field.\n6. Explore the neighboring fields of the carnation field: rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, orchid field, zinnia field.\n7. Explore the neighboring fields of the rose field: lily field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field.\n8. Explore the neighboring fields of the orchid field: peony field, carnation field, zinnia field.\n9. The orchid field is found.\n\nBased on the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the orchid field is: chrysanthemum, carnation, orchid.\n\nAnswer: Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Orchid"
