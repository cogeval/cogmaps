If yes, that's the shortest path.\nStep 4: If not, list the fields connected to each of the fields from step 2 and check if any of them are connected to the peony field.\nStep 5: Identify the shortest path from the rose field to the peony field.\n\nFrom the information given, we have the following connections:\n- Rose: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n- Lily: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n- Chrysanthemum: Poppy\n- Poppy: None\n- Carnation: Zinnia\n- Zinnia: Orchid, Peony\n- Orchid: Peony, Carnation\n- Peony: Zinnia\n\nFollowing the steps above, we find that the shortest path from the rose field to the peony field is through the carnation and zinnia fields.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony"
