None of these is directly connected to the Chrysanthemum field, so this route is not the shortest.\n\nPeony field: Connected to Zinnia field. Zinnia field is not directly connected to the Chrysanthemum field, so this route is not the shortest.\n\nCarnation field: Connected to Zinnia field and Rose field. Rose field is directly connected to the Chrysanthemum field.\n\nZinnia field: Not directly connected to the Chrysanthemum field.\n\nStep 4: Determine the shortest path.\n\nThe shortest path from the Sunflower field to the Chrysanthemum field is Sunflower field -> Carnation field -> Rose field -> Chrysanthemum field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Carnation, Rose, Chrysanthemum"
