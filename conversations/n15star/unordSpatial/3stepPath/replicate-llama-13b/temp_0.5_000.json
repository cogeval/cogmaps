You are assigned to the Flower County. (1) First of all, we have 15 flower fields here, all of which can be recognized as roses, lilies, chrysanthemums, tulips, daisies, orchids, marigolds, carnations, zinnias, lions, peonies, hydrangeas, daffodils, and lavenders. Every field is connected to one other field, except for the flower gardens, which are connected to no other fields. (2) Unfortunately, there is no path between you and the rose field, which happens to be directly opposite you. Please help me answer the question from the client. (3) It asks how they can travel to their love from the rose field directly opposing you, while following the path of the 15 fields in their way. (4) You only need to provide the flower names, and list them according to the length of the path and in the correct order. (The shortest path is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M and the length of path is 12 flowers. The order of flowers is A-L-G-D-F-C-I-J-K-B-H-M-E. For the answer that you send to the client, \"shortest path\" was added to \"Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\", so be careful.\nProblem: (6 lines)\nMr. Rose: How is a shortest path from flower rose (which is directly in front of you) to the lavender field without going back to the same flower more than once?
