The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose field (rose) -> Lily field (0 flowers) \n2. Lily field (0 flowers) -> Chrysanthemum field (0 flowers) \n3. Chrysanthemum field (0 flowers) -> Poppy field (0 flowers) \n\nAt this point, we have reached a dead end as all the connected fields have 0 flowers. Therefore, the shortest path from the rose field does not yield any flowers.\n\nAnswer: No flowers can be obtained by taking the shortest path from the rose field."

Rose field (rose) -> Aster field (0 flowers)\n\nSince the aster field is connected to all the zinnia field's neighboring fields, we need to explore further to determine the maximum number of flowers we can obtain.\n\nThe aster field is connected to the zinnia field, so we will continue as follows:\n2. Aster field (0 flowers) -> Zinnia field (0 flowers)\n\nAt this point, we have reached a dead end as the zinnia field does not have any neighboring fields. Therefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is just the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"
