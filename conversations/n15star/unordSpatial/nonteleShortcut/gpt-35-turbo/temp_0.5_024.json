The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

Initialize a priority queue with the rose field as the starting point, with a distance of 0.\n2. Initialize a distance array to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting point to each field. Set the distance of all fields to infinity, except for the rose field, which is set to 0.\n3. Initialize a flower count array to keep track of the number of flowers that can be obtained from each field. Set the count of all fields to 0, except for the peony field, which is set to 50 (the free bunch of peony flowers).\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Pop the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field connected to the current field, do the following steps:\n     - Calculate the distance from the starting point to the neighboring field through the current field.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring field, update the distance and flower count arrays accordingly.\n     - Add the neighboring field to the priority queue with the updated distance.\n5. Once the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the starting point (rose field) to each field, and the flower count array will contain the maximum number of flowers that can be obtained from each field.\n6. To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we can trace back from the lavender field (which offers a free bunch of 10 lavender flowers) to the rose field, following the fields with the maximum flower count.\n   - Start from the lavender field and find the neighboring field with the maximum flower count.\n   - Move to the neighboring field and repeat the process until reaching the rose field.\n7.
