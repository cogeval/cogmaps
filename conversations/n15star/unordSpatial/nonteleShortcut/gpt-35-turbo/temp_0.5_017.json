The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a priority queue to store the flower fields and their corresponding distances.\n4. Enqueue the rose field with distance 0 into the priority queue.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue the flower field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field connected to the current field, calculate the distance from the rose field to the neighboring field.\n   - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance stored in the distance array, update the distance array and enqueue the neighboring field into the priority queue.\n6. After the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the rose field to each flower field.\n7. To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we need to backtrack from the lavender field (since it offers the highest number of free flowers) to the rose field, following the fields with the smallest distances.\n   - Start at the lavender field.\n   - Check its neighboring fields and choose the one with the smallest distance.\n   - Repeat the above step until reaching the rose field.\n8.
