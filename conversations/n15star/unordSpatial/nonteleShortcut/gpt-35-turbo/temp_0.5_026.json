The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which will have a distance of 0. \n2. Create a priority queue and add the rose field to it.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field, calculate the distance to it by adding the number of flowers in the current field.\n   - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring field, update its distance and add it to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest path from the rose field to all other fields.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm step by step:\n\n1.
