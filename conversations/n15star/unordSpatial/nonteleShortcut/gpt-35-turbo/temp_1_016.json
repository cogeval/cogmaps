The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the initial field being the rose field.\n2. Initialize a distance array to store the shortest distance from the rose field to each field, with the initial distance for the rose field being 0.\n3. Initialize a flowers array to store the total number of flowers that can be collected from each field.\n4. Initialize a previous array to keep track of the previous field in the shortest path.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field connected to the current field:\n     - Calculate the total number of flowers that can be collected if you visit the neighboring field, based on the flowers available in the current field.\n     - If the total number of flowers is greater than the current maximum number of flowers that can be collected from the neighboring field:\n       - Update the maximum number of flowers for the neighboring field.\n       - Update the distance to the neighboring field as the sum of the distance to the current field and the length of the connection.\n       - Update the previous field for the neighboring field as the current field.\n       - Enqueue the neighboring field into the priority queue.\n6.
