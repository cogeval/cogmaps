The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

Since we can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field, we need to consider the options at each step.\n\n1. Rose field: We have the option to take a bunch of roses (Rose).\n2.
