The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

First, let's create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Poppy field: \n- Carnation field: Zinnia field\n- Zinnia field: \n\nNext, let's assign weights to each field. Since we want to maximize the number of flowers, we can assign a weight of 0 to all fields except for the peony field (50 flowers) and lavender field (10 flowers). The weights for these fields will be -50 and -10, respectively.\n\nNow, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the rose field:\n\n1. Initialize all field distances to infinity, except for the rose field which is 0.\n2. Set the current field as the rose field.\n3. For each neighboring field of the current field, calculate the distance to the neighboring field as the sum of the current field's distance and the weight of the neighboring field.\n4. If the calculated distance is less than the neighboring field's current distance, update the neighboring field's distance.\n5. Mark the current field as visited.\n6. Select the unvisited field with the smallest distance as the new current field and go back to step 3.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all fields have been visited.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the following shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\nRose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field"
