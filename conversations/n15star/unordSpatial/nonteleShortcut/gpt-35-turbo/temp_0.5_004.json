The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize the distances to all fields as infinity, except for the rose field which is 0. Also, create a dictionary to keep track of the previous field in the shortest path.\n\n2. Start from the rose field and visit its neighboring fields: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation.\n\n3. Update the distances and previous fields for the neighboring fields based on the number of flowers they yield:\n   - For the lily field, the distance is 1 (from rose) and the previous field is rose.\n   - For the chrysanthemum field, the distance is 1 (from rose) and the previous field is rose.\n   - For the poppy field, the distance is 1 (from rose) and the previous field is rose.\n   - For the carnation field, the distance is 1 (from rose) and the previous field is rose.\n\n4. Now, we have visited all neighboring fields of the rose field. We need to choose the field with the maximum number of flowers and the shortest distance. In this case, all neighboring fields have the same distance, so we choose the field with the maximum number of flowers, which is the carnation field.\n\n5. Move to the carnation field and repeat steps 2-4 for its neighboring fields: zinnia.\n\n6. Update the distances and previous fields for the neighboring fields based on the number of flowers they yield:\n   - For the zinnia field, the distance is 2 (from rose through carnation) and the previous field is carnation.\n\n7. Now, we have visited all neighboring fields of the carnation field. We need to choose the field with the maximum number of flowers and the shortest distance. In this case, the zinnia field has the maximum number of flowers (50 peony flowers), so we choose the zinnia field.\n\n8. Move to the zinnia field and repeat steps 2-4 for its neighboring fields: peony.\n\n9. Update the distances and previous fields for the neighboring fields based on the number of flowers they yield:\n   - For the peony field, the distance is 3 (from rose through carnation and zinnia) and the previous field is zinnia.\n\n10. Now, we have visited all neighboring fields of the zinnia field. We need to choose the field with the maximum number of flowers and the shortest distance. In this case, the peony field has the maximum number of flowers (50 peony flowers), so we choose the peony field.\n\n11. Move to the peony field and repeat steps 2-4 for its neighboring fields: none.\n\n12. Since the peony field has no neighboring fields, we have reached the end of the path.\n\n13. To obtain the shortest path, we can backtrack from the peony field using the previous fields recorded during the algorithm. The path is: rose, carnation, zinnia, peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony."
