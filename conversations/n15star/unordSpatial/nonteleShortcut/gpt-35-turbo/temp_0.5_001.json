The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's consider each option:\n\n1. Rose field -> Lily field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n2. Rose field -> Chrysanthemum field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n3. Rose field -> Poppy field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n4. Rose field -> Carnation field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n\nSince none of the paths from the rose field yield additional flowers, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is just the rose field itself.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas, starting from the rose field are:\n\nAnswer: Rose."

Rose field -> Poppy field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n4. Rose field -> Carnation field: This path does not yield any additional flowers.\n5. Rose field -> Aster field: This path leads to the aster field, which is connected to the zinnia field.\n\nSince the aster field is connected to the zinnia field, we can potentially collect flowers from both fields. However, we are only allowed to take one bunch of flowers from one field. Therefore, we need to choose between the aster field and the zinnia field.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that we can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if we visit the peony field, and a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if we visit the lavender field. Unfortunately, neither the aster field nor the zinnia field offer these specific flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is still just the rose field itself.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas, starting from the rose field are:\n\nAnswer: Rose."
