The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the rose field as the starting point.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting field to each field, with the distance to the rose field set to 0 and all other distances set to infinity.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the previous field in the shortest path to each field, with the previous field of the rose field set to None.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Pop the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   b. For each neighboring field of the popped field:\n      i. Calculate the new distance from the starting field to the neighboring field by adding the number of flowers in the popped field to the distance of the popped field.\n      ii. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance to the neighboring field:\n          - Update the distance to the neighboring field.\n          - Update the previous field of the neighboring field to the popped field.\n          - Push the neighboring field with the new distance into the priority queue.\n5. Once the algorithm finishes, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the rose field to the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n   a. Start from the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n   b. Follow the previous field pointers until reaching the rose field, recording the flower names along the way.\n   c. Reverse the recorded flower names to get the shortest path from the rose field to the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Zinnia, Peony"

Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the rose field to each field, considering the updated graph.\n3.
