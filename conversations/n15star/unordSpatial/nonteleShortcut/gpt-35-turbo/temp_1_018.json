The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

First, let's consider the connection to the lily field. From the lily field, we can visit the chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and the lavender field. However, since we can only take flowers from one field, we need to choose the field that gives us the most flowers. None of these fields offer free flowers, so we move on.\n\n2. Next, let's consider the connection to the chrysanthemum field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can visit the poppy field, which is connected to the lavender field. Again, none of these fields offer free flowers, so we move on.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the connection to the poppy field. From the poppy field, we can visit the lavender field, which offers a bunch of 10 free lavender flowers. Since this is the only option that gives us free flowers, we choose to visit the lavender field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, poppy, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Lavender"

Let's consider the connection to the lily field. From the lily field, we don't have any further connections that give us free flowers, so we move on.\n\n2. Next, let's consider the connection to the chrysanthemum field. Similarly, there are no further connections that give us free flowers, so we move on.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the connection to the poppy field. Again, there are no additional connections that give us free flowers, so we move on.\n\n4. Moving on to the connection with the carnation field. Once again, there are no further connections that give us free flowers, so we move on.\n\n5. Lastly, let's consider the newly discovered connection to the aster field. It is mentioned that the aster field is connected to all the zinnia field's neighboring fields. From the zinnia field, we know that it is connected to the peony field. Since the peony field offers a bunch of 50 free peony flowers, this is the field we should visit.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony"
