However, since we have already visited Sephora, we should not visit it again, but we can use the connections Sephora has to Nike.\nStep 5: Determine the path from Starbucks to Sephora and then to the connected stores, which is Starbucks -> Sephora -> Nike (with Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, and Bath and Body Works also connected to Sephora, but they are not on the most rewarding path).\nStep 6: Identify the connections from Nike (Carter Children, Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well).\nStep 7: Assess each connection to find the path that yields the most reward:\n- Nike -> Carter Children -> Pete's Coffee, Sephora, Bath and Body Works\n- Nike -> Sephora (Already visited; Ignore this connection)\n- Nike -> Bath and Body Works -> Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Sephora\n- Nike -> Chickflea -> Baskin and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well\n- Nike -> Baskin and Robins -> Levis, GNC Live Well, Target\n- Nike -> Levis -> Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, GNC Live Well, Target\n- Nike -> GNC Live Well -> Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, Levis, Target\nStep 8: The path that yields the most reward is through Baskin and Robins since it connects to three additional stores. So, the path so far is Starbucks -> Sephora -> Nike -> Baskin and Robins.\nStep 9: Identify the connections from Baskin and Robins (Chickflea, Levis, GNC Live Well, Target).\nStep 10: Assess each connection to find the path that yields the most reward:\n- Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Levis, GNC Live Well\n- Baskin and Robins -> Levis -> Chickflea, GNC Live Well, Target\n- Baskin and Robins -> GNC Live Well -> Chickflea, Levis, Target\n- Baskin and Robins -> Target -> Levis, GNC Live Well\nStep 11: The path that yields the most reward is through Levis since it connects to two additional stores (Chickflea has already been connected to through Nike). So, the final path is Starbucks -> Sephora -> Nike -> Baskin and Robins -> Levis.\nStep 12: Identify the connections from Levis (Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, GNC Live Well, Target).\nStep 13: Since we have already visited all these stores in previous steps, there is no need to visit them again. Thus, the final path with the most reward is Starbucks -> Sephora -> Nike -> Baskin and Robins -> Levis.\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Sephora, Nike, Baskin and Robins, Levis"
