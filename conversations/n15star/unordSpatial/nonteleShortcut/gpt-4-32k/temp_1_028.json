The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose field\n2. Sunflower field\n3. Orchid field\n4. Peony field\n\nLavender field path:\n1. Rose field\n2. Daisy field\n3. Lavender field\n\nThe shortest path to the peony field has 4 fields, while the shortest path to the lavender field has only 3 fields. However, the peony field offers 50 flowers, while the lavender field offers only 10 flowers. Since the goal is to get the maximum number of flowers, we should choose the path to the peony field even though it is one field longer.\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field"

Rose field\n2. Sunflower field\n3. Orchid field\n4. Peony field\n\nLavender field path:\n1. Rose field\n2. Daisy field\n3. Lavender field\n\nSince the aster field is connected to all the zinnia field's neighboring fields, let's find the shortest path to the zinnia field from the rose field:\n\nZinnia field path:\n1. Rose field\n2. Aster field\n3. Zinnia field\n\nNow, let's check the neighboring fields of the zinnia field:\n\n1. Sunflower field (connected to Orchid field, Peony field, and Carnation field)\n2. Orchid field (connected to Peony field and Carnation field)\n3. Carnation field\n\nThe Peony field can now be reached via the aster field, shortening the previous path:\n\nUpdated Peony field path:\n1. Rose field\n2. Aster field\n3. Sunflower field\n4. Peony field\n\nThe updated path to the Peony field is the same length as the previous path. The shortest path to the lavender field remains the same, with 3 fields. Since the peony field offers 50 flowers, and the lavender field offers only 10 flowers, the path to the peony field still yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Aster field, Sunflower field, Peony field"
