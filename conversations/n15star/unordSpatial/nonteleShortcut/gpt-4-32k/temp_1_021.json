From Paris Baguette, we can go to H&M, Zara, Marshalls, or back to Starbucks.\n3. If we choose H&M, we can go to Zara or Paris Baguette.\n4. If we choose Zara, we can go to H&M or Paris Baguette.\n5. If we choose Marshalls, we can go to Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, or Target.\n6. If we choose Target, we can go to Levis, GNC Live Well, Marshalls, Baskin and Robins.\n7. If we choose Levis, we can go to GNC Live Well, Target, or Baskin and Robins.\n8. If we choose GNC Live Well, we can go to Target or Levis.\n9. If we choose Baskin and Robins, we can go to Chickflea, Levis, or Target.\n10. If we choose Chickflea, we can only go to Baskin and Robins.\n11. If we go to Nike from Baskin and Robins or Levis, we will not be able to return to any previous stores.\n12. To maximize reward, we should visit all possible stores without repeating them and while avoiding stores with no return (Nike, Chickflea).\n\nNow, we can list the optimal path:\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, Marshalls, Target, Levis, GNC Live Well, Baskin and Robins, H&M, Zara"
