The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add the rose field to it.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the extracted field, calculate the total number of flowers that can be obtained by visiting that field.\n   - If the total number of flowers is greater than the current maximum number of flowers for that field, update the maximum number of flowers and the path to that field.\n   - If the distance to the neighboring field from the extracted field plus the number of flowers obtained is less than the current distance to that field, update the distance and add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, the maximum number of flowers and the shortest path to obtain them will be stored.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1.

Create a priority queue and add the rose field to it.\n   - Priority queue: [Rose]\n\n3.
