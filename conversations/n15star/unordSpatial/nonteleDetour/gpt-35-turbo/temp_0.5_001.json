The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\n1. Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add the rose field to it.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Pop the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each adjacent field, calculate the total number of flowers that can be obtained by visiting that field.\n   - If the total number of flowers is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum and store the path.\n   - If the distance to the adjacent field is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and add the field to the priority queue.\n4. The shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers will be the stored path.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the distances:\n   - Rose field: 0\n   - Lily field: infinity\n   - Chrysanthemum field: infinity\n   - Poppy field: infinity\n   - Carnation field: infinity\n   - Sunflower field: infinity\n   - Orchid field: infinity\n   - Peony field: infinity\n   - Zinnia field: infinity\n   - Tulip field: infinity\n   - Hydrangea field: infinity\n   - Daffodil field: infinity\n   - Marigold field: infinity\n   - Daisy field: infinity\n   - Lavender field: infinity\n\n2.
