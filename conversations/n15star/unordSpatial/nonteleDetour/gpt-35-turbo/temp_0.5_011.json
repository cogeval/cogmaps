The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize all flower fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue to store the flower fields based on their distances.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Extract the flower field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   b. For each neighboring flower field, calculate the distance from the current flower field and update it if it is smaller than the previous distance.\n   c. If the updated distance is smaller, add the neighboring flower field to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest path from the rose field to all other flower fields.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the rose field:\n\n1. Initialize the distances of all flower fields as follows:\n   - Rose field: 0\n   - Lily field: infinity\n   - Chrysanthemum field: infinity\n   - Poppy field: infinity\n   - Carnation field: infinity\n   - Orchid field: infinity\n   - Sunflower field: infinity\n   - Peony field: infinity\n   - Zinnia field: infinity\n   - Tulip field: infinity\n   - Hydrangea field: infinity\n   - Daffodil field: infinity\n   - Marigold field: infinity\n   - Daisy field: infinity\n   - Lavender field: infinity\n\n2. Start with the rose field and update the distances to its neighboring flower fields:\n   - Lily field: distance = 1 (rose field + 1)\n   - Chrysanthemum field: distance = 1 (rose field + 1)\n   - Poppy field: distance = 1 (rose field + 1)\n   - Carnation field: distance = 1 (rose field + 1)\n\n3. Add the neighboring flower fields (lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation) to the priority queue.\n\n4. Continue with the next flower field in the priority queue (lily field) and update its neighboring flower fields:\n   - Chrysanthemum field: distance = 2 (lily field + 1)\n   - Poppy field: distance = 2 (lily field + 1)\n\n5. Add the neighboring flower fields (chrysanthemum and poppy) to the priority queue.\n\n6. Repeat the process until all flower fields have been visited.\n\nThe shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Lavender field\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
