The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's go step by step:\n\n1. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field. We can choose any of these fields to visit first.\n\n2. Let's consider visiting the lily field first. From the lily field, we can go to the daisy field, which is connected to the lavender field. However, since we are looking for the shortest path, we will not choose this route.\n\n3. Next, let's consider visiting the chrysanthemum field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can go to the poppy field, which is connected to the daisy field. Again, since we are looking for the shortest path, we will not choose this route.\n\n4. Now, let's consider visiting the poppy field. From the poppy field, we can go to the daisy field, which is connected to the lavender field. This route seems promising as we can get a bunch of lavender flowers for free. However, we need to check if there is a shorter route.\n\n5. Finally, let's consider visiting the carnation field. From the carnation field, we can go to the zinnia field, which is connected to the peony field. Since we can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if we visit the peony field, this route seems to be the most beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nRose, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony"
