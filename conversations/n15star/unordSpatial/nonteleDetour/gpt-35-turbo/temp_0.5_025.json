The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the rose field as the starting point.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting field to each field, with the rose field having a distance of 0 and all other fields having a distance of infinity.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the previous field visited for each field, with the rose field having no previous field.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Get the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field connected to the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the starting field to the neighboring field through the current field.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current shortest distance to the neighboring field:\n       - Update the shortest distance to the neighboring field.\n       - Update the previous field visited for the neighboring field.\n       - Add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n5. Once the algorithm finishes, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the rose field to any other field by following the previous fields visited.\n6. Starting from the lavender field, follow the previous fields visited until reaching the rose field, and list the flower names in the order visited.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Lavender"
