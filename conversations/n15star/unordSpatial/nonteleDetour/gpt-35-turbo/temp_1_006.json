The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize the distance to each flower field as infinity, except for the rose field which is set to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add the rose field with distance 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Extract the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each adjacent field, calculate the distance to reach that field from the current field. Update the distance if it is smaller than the previously calculated distance.\n   - Add the adjacent field to the priority queue with its updated distance.\n4. After all fields have been processed, we will have the shortest distance to each field from the rose field.\n5. Now, we will backtrack from the lavender field to the rose field to find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n6. Starting from the lavender field, compare the distances of the adjacent fields and choose the field with the shortest distance.\n7. Repeat step 6 until we reach the rose field.\n8.
