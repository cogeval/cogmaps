The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's build the graph based on the given information:\n\n- Rose field is connected to Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Carnation field.\n- Lily field is connected to Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field is connected to Poppy field.\n- Poppy field is connected to Carnation field.\n- Carnation field is connected to Zinnia field.\n- Sunflower field is connected to Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, and Zinnia field.\n- Orchid field is connected to Peony field, Carnation field, and Zinnia field.\n- Peony field is connected to Zinnia field.\n- Tulip field is connected to Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Peony field.\n- Hydrangea field is connected to Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Lavender field.\n- Daffodil field is connected to Marigold field and Lavender field.\n- Marigold field is connected to Lavender field.\n- Daisy field is connected to Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Lavender field.\n\nNow let's use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. Create a priority queue and initialize it with the starting field (Rose field).\n2. Create a distance map to track the shortest distance to each field. Initialize all distances except the starting field with infinity.\n3. Create a flower count map to track the maximum number of flowers obtained at each field. Initialize all counts except the starting field with 0.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the field with the shortest distance.\n   - For each neighbor of the current field:\n     - Calculate the total flower count if we visit the neighbor field (current flower count + free flowers obtained at the neighbor field).\n     - If the total flower count is greater than the current maximum flower count at the neighbor field, update the flower count.\n     - Calculate the total distance if we visit the neighbor field (current distance + 1).\n     - If the total distance is less than the current shortest distance at the neighbor field, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor field.\n5. Return the flower count at the destination field (Peony field in this case).\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from the Rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is as follows: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony"
