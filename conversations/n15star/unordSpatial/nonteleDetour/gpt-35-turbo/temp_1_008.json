The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's analyze the number of flowers in each connected field:\n\n- Lily field: connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. No other field is connected to it. \n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the poppy field. No other field is connected to it. \n- Poppy field: connected to the lily field and chrysanthemum field. No other field is connected to it.\n- Carnation field: connected to the zinnia field. No other field is connected to it.\n\nBased on this analysis, the rose field is connected to the most flower fields, which gives us a higher chance of maximizing the number of flowers. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy."

No other field is connected to it.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the poppy field. No other field is connected to it.\n- Poppy field: connected to the lily field and carnation field. No other field is connected to it.\n- Carnation field: connected to the zinnia field. No other field is connected to it.\n\nSince the door from the rose field to the carnation field is locked, we cannot directly access the carnation field. Therefore, we should choose the field with the most flowers among the remaining options.\n\nBased on this analysis, the updated shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy."
