The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

However, the peony field is not directly connected to the rose field.\n\nSince we are aiming to maximize the number of flowers, we should prioritize visiting the peony field to get the free bunch of 50 peony flowers. To reach the peony field, we need to find the shortest path from the rose field.\n\nThe rose field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and the chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field. From the poppy field, we can reach the peony field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Peony\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Peony"

However, since the door to the carnation field is locked, we cannot directly access the peony field.\n\nAnalyzing the connections further, we find that the chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field, and the poppy field is now connected to the carnation field. From the carnation field, we can reach the zinnia field, which is connected to the peony field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the updated connections, is:\n\nRose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony"
