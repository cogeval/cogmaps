Starbucks - Target - Levis - GNC Live Well - Baskins and Robins - Chickflea - Nike - Sephora\n2. Starbucks - Target - Marshalls - Paris Baguette - H&M - Zara - Sephora\n3. Starbucks - Target - Levis - GNC Live Well - Baskins and Robins - Chickflea - Nike - Carter Children - Sephora\n\nNow let's assign rewards for each store:\n- Starbucks: 0 (since you're already there)\n- Target: 5\n- Levis: 4\n- GNC Live Well: 3\n- Baskins and Robins: 2\n- Chickflea: 1\n- Nike: 3\n- Sephora: 5\n- Marshalls: 4\n- Paris Baguette: 3\n- H&M: 2\n- Zara: 2\n- Carter Children: 1\n- Bath and Body Works: 0 (since it's not in any path to Sephora)\n\nCalculate the total rewards for each path:\n1. 0 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 23\n2. 0 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 21\n3. 0 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 24\n\nPath 3 has the highest reward.
