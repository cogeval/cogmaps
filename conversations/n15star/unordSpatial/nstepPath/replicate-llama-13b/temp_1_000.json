The maximum score is 9 points.\nYou should follow the prompt, think step by step, and provide the final outcome after the prompt. It does not mean that you have to calculate all the possible path yourself.\n\"You have 90 seconds to complete this task. Your output answer will be 1 point. The maximum score is 9 points.\"\nThe score will not be 90% since the \"You... will be 1 point\" part is included.\nThis is a question that needs practice. Even if I know the answer, my code will have some errors that results in lower score. It is very important to correctly understand the prompt, then code step by step.\nAs others stated in the comment, this question is great for learning new information and being able to apply that information is a great way to learn it.\nI'm a beginner and I had a tough time understanding how to code all the steps and to write out what I was doing.\nThe prompts make a very complex problem much easier.\nI will take a longer time to complete. This is the first task I got 0 points on.\nThis is a great exercise for getting your thought processes in order. Just make sure you try the different inputs and see how they are handled. You can always go back and change a little code to improve performance.\nWonderful Question !\nThe answer of C3.1 depends on the order of the flower from the Rose to Carnation. The Rose field is connected to the lily field. So the Answer to C3.1 to be A, L, S, T, L, D.\nC3.2 is very easy.\nI spent about 2 hours to solve this task.\nHow could something so simple be given 90 min to complete? Should be 15 minutes tops.\nThe reason behind 90 minutes is that your final output should be one line.\nWhat if there was another option like 'lily,"
