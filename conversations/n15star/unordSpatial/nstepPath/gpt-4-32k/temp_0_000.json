Rose field is connected to lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Lily field is connected to chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n3. Chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field.\n4. Poppy field has no further connections.\n5. Carnation field is connected to zinnia field.\n6. Zinnia field has no further connections.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that there is no direct path from the rose field to the hydrangea field. We need to find an indirect path.\n\n1. From the rose field, we can go to the lily field.\n2. From the lily field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field.\n3. From the chrysanthemum field, we can go to the poppy field.\n4. From the poppy field, we can go to the daisy field.\n5. From the daisy field, we can go to the lavender field.\n6. From the lavender field, we can go to the marigold field.\n7.
