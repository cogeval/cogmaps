The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. What is the shortest path from the carnation field to the hydrangea field?

Keep track of the paths:\n- Rose field connects to: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Sunflower field connects to: Orchid field, Peony field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field connects to: Peony field, Zinnia field, Sunflower field\n- Zinnia field connects to: Peony field, Orchid field, Sunflower field, Carnation field\n\nStep 4: The hydrangea field is not directly connected to any of these fields. So, we need to move to the next connected fields:\n\n- Lily field connects to: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Daisy field\n- Chrysanthemum field connects to: Poppy field, Lily field, Daisy field\n- Poppy field connects to: Chrysanthemum field, Lily field, Daisy field\n- Orchid field connects to: Peony field, Zinnia field, Sunflower field\n- Peony field connects to: Zinnia field, Orchid field, Sunflower field, Tulip field\n- Zinnia field connects to: Peony field, Orchid field, Sunflower field, Carnation field\n- Daisy field connects to: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Lavender field connects to: Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field\n\nStep 5: The hydrangea field is directly connected to the lavender field. So, the shortest path must include the lavender field.\n\nStep 6: Trace back the path to the carnation field:\n- Lavender field -> Daisy field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Rose field -> Carnation field\n\nAnswer: Carnation field, Rose field, Chrysanthemum field, Daisy field, Lavender field, Hydrangea field"
