Check which of these connected fields are closer to the poppy field:\n   - Sunflower: connected to carnation and zinnia\n   - Orchid: connected to carnation and zinnia\n   - Tulip: connected to hydrangea, daffodil, and marigold\n   - Zinnia: connected to sunflower, orchid, and carnation\n4. Tulip seems to be the best option, as it is connected to hydrangea and daffodil, which are only one connection away from poppy field through daisy field and lily field, respectively.\n5. Move to tulip field.\n6. Now, consider connected fields: hydrangea, daffodil, and marigold.\n7. Check which of these connected fields are closer to the poppy field:\n   - Hydrangea: connected to daisy (which is connected to poppy)\n   - Daffodil: connected to lily (which is connected to poppy)\n   - Marigold: connected to lavender (which is not connected to poppy)\n8. Either hydrangea or daffodil are good options. Choose hydrangea.\n9. Move to hydrangea field.\n10. Now, consider connected fields: daisy, daffodil, and marigold.\n11. Daisy is the only field connected to the poppy field.\n12. Move to daisy field.\n13. Now, consider connected fields: lily, chrysanthemum, and poppy.\n14. Poppy field is directly connected.\n15.
