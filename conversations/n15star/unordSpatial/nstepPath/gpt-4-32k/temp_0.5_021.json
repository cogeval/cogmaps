The orchid field is not directly connected to the daisy field either. The tulip field is not directly connected to the daisy field.\nStep 5: Check the connections from the sunflower field, orchid field, and tulip field to see if any are connected to the daisy field. The sunflower field is connected to the carnation field, which is connected to the zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the peony, carnation, and zinnia fields. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, which is connected to the lavender field.\nStep 6: The lavender field is connected to the daisy field. So, the shortest path from the peony field to the daisy field is: peony field, tulip field, hydrangea field, lavender field, and daisy field.\n\nAnswer: Peony field, Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Lavender field, Daisy field"
