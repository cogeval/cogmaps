This means that the output should start with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of flower names, in alphabetical order, with the last flower name being \"hydrangea\".\r\n\r\nThe shortest path from the rose field to the hydrangea field is four steps long. The rose field is directly connected to the lily field, and the lily field is directly connected to the chrysanthemum field. The chrysanthemum field is then directly connected to the hydrangea field. Therefore, the output should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer: rose, lily, chrysanthemum, hydrangea\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
