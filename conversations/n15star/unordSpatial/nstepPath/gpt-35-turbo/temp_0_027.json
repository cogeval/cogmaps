Start at the tulip field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field: hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue in the order they were discovered: hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony.\n4. Mark the tulip field as visited.\n5. Dequeue the first field from the queue (hydrangea).\n6. Check the neighboring fields of the dequeued field: daffodil, marigold, and lavender.\n7. Add the unvisited neighboring fields to the queue: daffodil, marigold, and lavender.\n8. Mark the dequeued field (hydrangea) as visited.\n9. Repeat steps 5-8 until the queue is empty or the rose field is found.\n10. The shortest path from the tulip field to the rose field is the sequence of fields visited during the BFS algorithm.\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender, Rose"
