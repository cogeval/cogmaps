Let's create a graph with the given connections:\n\n- Zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, and carnation field.\n- Sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, sunflower field, and zinnia field.\n- Peony field is connected to the zinnia field, orchid field, and carnation field.\n- Carnation field is connected to the zinnia field, sunflower field, orchid field, peony field, and marigold field.\n- Marigold field is connected to the lavender field, carnation field, daffodil field, and hydrangea field.\n- Lavender field is connected to the marigold field, daisy field, and hydrangea field.\n- Daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field.\n- Lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and daisy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field, lily field, and daisy field.\n- Poppy field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, lily field, daisy field, and carnation field.\n- Daffodil field is connected to the marigold field, hydrangea field, and lavender field.\n- Hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm starting from the zinnia field:\n\n1. Start at the zinnia field.\n2. Enqueue the zinnia field.\n3. Mark the zinnia field as visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued field is the lavender field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring fields of the dequeued field and mark them as visited.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from the zinnia field to the lavender field.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Carnation, Marigold, Lavender"
