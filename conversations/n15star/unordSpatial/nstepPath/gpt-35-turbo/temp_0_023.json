Start at the zinnia field.\n2. Check its connections: zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field.\n3. Add the connected fields to a queue: sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (sunflower field) and check its connections: sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n5. Add the connected fields to the queue, but skip zinnia field since we have already visited it: orchid field, peony field, and carnation field.\n6. Continue this process, taking fields from the queue, checking their connections, and adding unvisited fields to the queue until we reach the daisy field.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the daisy field is:\n\nZinnia, Carnation, Poppy, Daisy\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Carnation, Poppy, Daisy"
