Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n3. From the rose field, we can choose any of these fields to continue our path. Let's choose the chrysanthemum field.\n4. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n5. From the chrysanthemum field, we can move to the poppy field.\n6. The poppy field is connected to the carnation field.\n7. From the poppy field, we can move to the carnation field.\n8. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n9. From the carnation field, we can move to the zinnia field.\n10. The zinnia field is connected to the marigold field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the marigold field is: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Zinnia, Marigold."
