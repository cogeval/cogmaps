Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\n- Poppy field: connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n- Rose field: connected to the poppy field.\n- Lily field: connected to the rose field, daisy field, and chrysanthemum field.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the rose field, lily field, poppy field, and daisy field.\n- Daisy field: connected to the poppy field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and lavender field.\n- Lavender field: connected to the daisy field, hydrangea field, and marigold field.\n- Hydrangea field: connected to the lavender field, daffodil field, and marigold field.\n- Daffodil field: connected to the hydrangea field, marigold field, and tulip field.\n- Marigold field: connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, lavender field, and zinnia field.\n- Tulip field: connected to the daffodil field, hydrangea field, marigold field, and peony field.\n- Orchid field: connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Peony field: connected to the tulip field, orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Zinnia field: connected to the peony field, carnation field, marigold field, and orchid field.\n- Carnation field: connected to the rose field, poppy field, orchid field, peony field, and zinnia field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the poppy field to the tulip field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the poppy field.\n2. Add the poppy field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the tulip field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the poppy field to the tulip field.\n\nUsing the breadth-first search algorithm, the shortest path from the poppy field to the tulip field is:\n\nPoppy field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Daisy field, Lavender field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Tulip field.\n\nAnswer: Poppy field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Daisy field, Lavender field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Tulip field."
