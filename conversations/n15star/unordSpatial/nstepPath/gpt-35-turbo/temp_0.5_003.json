Start from the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n3. Since the tulip field is not directly connected to the rose field, we need to explore the connected fields.\n4. From the rose field, the lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n5. From the chrysanthemum field, the poppy field is connected to the carnation field.\n6. From the poppy field, the carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n7. From the carnation field, the zinnia field is connected to the peony field.\n8. From the peony field, the tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field (loop).\n9. From the hydrangea field, the daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field.\n10. From the daffodil field, the marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n11.
