Start at the zinnia field.\n2. Check its connections: zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field.\n3. Add the connected fields to a queue: sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (sunflower field) and check its connections: sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field (already visited).\n5. Add the unvisited connected fields to the queue: orchid field, peony field, and carnation field.\n6. Take the first field from the queue (orchid field) and check its connections: orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field (already visited).\n7. Add the unvisited connected fields to the queue: peony field and carnation field.\n8. Take the first field from the queue (peony field) and check its connections: peony field is connected to the zinnia field (already visited).\n9. Since the lavender field is not found yet, continue with the next field in the queue.\n10. Take the next field from the queue (carnation field) and check its connections: carnation field is connected to the zinnia field (already visited).\n11. Since the lavender field is not found yet, continue with the next field in the queue.\n12. Take the next field from the queue (peony field) and check its connections: peony field is connected to the zinnia field (already visited).\n13. Since the lavender field is not found yet, continue with the next field in the queue.\n14. The queue is empty, and the lavender field is not found. Therefore, there is no path from the zinnia field to the lavender field.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from the zinnia field to the lavender field."
