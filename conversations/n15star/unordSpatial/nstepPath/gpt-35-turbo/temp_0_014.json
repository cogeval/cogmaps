Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Check its connections: orchid, peony, carnation, and zinnia.\n3. Add the connected fields to a queue in the order they were mentioned: orchid, peony, carnation, zinnia.\n4. Take the first field from the queue (orchid) and check its connections: peony, carnation, and zinnia.\n5. Add the connected fields to the end of the queue if they are not already in the queue: peony, carnation, zinnia.\n6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the lavender field is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the lavender field is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, orchid, zinnia, lavender"
