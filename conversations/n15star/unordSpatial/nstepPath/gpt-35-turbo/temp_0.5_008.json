Let's map out the connections between the flower fields:\n\n- Poppy field is connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n- Lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n- Daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field.\n- Lavender field is connected to the daisy field, hydrangea field, and marigold field.\n- Hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- Daffodil field is connected to the hydrangea field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- Marigold field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, and lavender field.\n- Zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, carnation field, and peony field.\n- Sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Orchid field is connected to the sunflower field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Carnation field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, orchid field, zinnia field, and poppy field.\n- Peony field is connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the poppy field to the peony field:\n\n1. Starting from the poppy field, we have the following options: rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n2. From the daisy field, we can go to the lavender field.\n3. From the lavender field, we can go to the hydrangea field.\n4. From the hydrangea field, we can go to the daffodil field.\n5. From the daffodil field, we can go to the marigold field.\n6. From the marigold field, we can go to the peony field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the poppy field to the peony field is: poppy, daisy, lavender, hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, peony.\n\nAnswer: Poppy, Daisy, Lavender, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony."
