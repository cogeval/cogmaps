Starting from the tulip field, we can see that it is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n2. From the hydrangea field, we can move to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n3. From the daffodil field, we can move to the marigold field and lavender field.\n4. From the marigold field, we can move to the lavender field.\n5. Finally, from the lavender field, we can move to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the tulip field to the chrysanthemum field is: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender, Chrysanthemum.\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender, Chrysanthemum."
