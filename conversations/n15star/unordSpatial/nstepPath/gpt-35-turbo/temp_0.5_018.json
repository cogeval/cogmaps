The peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n3. The zinnia field is not connected to the lily field, so we need to find another path.\n4. From the zinnia field, we can go to the sunflower field.\n5. The sunflower field is not connected to the lily field, so we need to find another path.\n6. From the sunflower field, we can go to the orchid field.\n7. The orchid field is not connected to the lily field, so we need to find another path.\n8. From the orchid field, we can go to the carnation field.\n9. The carnation field is connected to the lily field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the peony field to the lily field is: Peony, Zinnia, Sunflower, Orchid, Carnation, Lily.\n\nAnswer: Peony, Zinnia, Sunflower, Orchid, Carnation, Lily."
