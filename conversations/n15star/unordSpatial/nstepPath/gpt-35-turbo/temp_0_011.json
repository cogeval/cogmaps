Check the neighboring fields of the peony field: zinnia field.\n5. Check the neighboring fields of the zinnia field: sunflower field, orchid field, and hydrangea field.\n\nSince the hydrangea field is one of the neighboring fields of the zinnia field, the shortest path from the carnation field to the hydrangea field is:\n\nAnswer: Carnation, Zinnia, Hydrangea"
