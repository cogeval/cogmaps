The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. What is the shortest path from the hydrangea field to the carnation field?

Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges:\n\n- Hydrangea field is connected to Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Lavender field.\n- Daffodil field is connected to Marigold field and Lavender field.\n- Marigold field is connected to Lavender field.\n- Lavender field is connected to Daisy field.\n\nWe can see that the Daisy field is connected to the Lily field, which is connected to the Chrysanthemum field, and finally to the Carnation field.\n\nSo, the shortest path from the Hydrangea field to the Carnation field would be:\n\nHydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender, Daisy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Carnation.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender, Daisy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Carnation."
