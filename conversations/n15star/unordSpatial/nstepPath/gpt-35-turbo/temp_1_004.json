Starting from the Lily Field, we will explore the connected fields and keep track of the shortest path to each field.\n\n1. Start from the Lily Field.\n2. Visit the Lily Field's connected fields: Chrysanthemum Field and Poppy Field.\n3. Visit the Chrysanthemum Field's connected field: Poppy Field.\n4. Visit the Poppy Field's connected fields: \n5. Visit the Carnation Field's connected field: Zinnia Field.\n6. Visit the Zinnia Field's connected field: Peony Field.\n\nThe shortest path from the Lily Field to the Peony Field is Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Zinnia Field, Peony Field.\n\nAnswer: Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Zinnia Field, Peony Field."
