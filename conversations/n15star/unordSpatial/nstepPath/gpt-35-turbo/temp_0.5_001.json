Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the rose field.\n3. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n4. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the lily field.\n5. Check the neighboring fields of the lily field.\n6. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n7. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the chrysanthemum field.\n8. Check the neighboring fields of the chrysanthemum field.\n9. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field. Add this field to the BFS queue.\n10. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the poppy field.\n11. Check the neighboring fields of the poppy field.\n12. The poppy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field. Add the lily field and chrysanthemum field to the BFS queue.\n13. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the carnation field.\n14. Check the neighboring fields of the carnation field.\n15. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. Add this field to the BFS queue.\n16. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the zinnia field.\n17. Check the neighboring fields of the zinnia field.\n18. The zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field. Add the sunflower field and peony field to the BFS queue.\n19. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the sunflower field.\n20. Check the neighboring fields of the sunflower field.\n21. The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field. Add this field to the BFS queue.\n22. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the orchid field.\n23. Check the neighboring fields of the orchid field.\n24. The orchid field is connected to the peony field and zinnia field. Add the peony field to the BFS queue.\n25. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the peony field.\n26. Check the neighboring fields of the peony field.\n27. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. Add this field to the BFS queue.\n28. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the daisy field.\n29. Check the neighboring fields of the daisy field.\n30. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. Add the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and poppy field to the BFS queue.\n31. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the lavender field.\n32. Check the neighboring fields of the lavender field.\n33. The lavender field is connected to the daisy field and marigold field. Add the daisy field to the BFS queue.\n34. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the marigold field.\n35. Check the neighboring fields of the marigold field.\n36. The marigold field is connected to the hydrangea field and lavender field. Add the hydrangea field to the BFS queue.\n37. Move to the next field in the queue, which is the hydrangea field.\n38. Check the neighboring fields of the hydrangea field.\n39. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. Add the daffodil field to the BFS queue.\n\nThe shortest path from the rose field to the daffodil field, including the rose field, is: \n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Poppy, Daisy, Lavender, Hydrangea, Daffodil"
