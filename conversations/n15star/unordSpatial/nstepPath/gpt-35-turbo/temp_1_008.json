Chrysanthemum field: Connected to the rose field, lily field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n4. Carnation field: Connected to the rose field, chrysanthemum field, orchid field, and zinnia field.\n5. Zinnia field: Connected to the sunflower field, carnation field, and peony field.\n6. Sunflower field: Connected to the orchid field.\n7. Orchid field: Connected to the sunflower field, zinnia field, and peony field.\n8. Peony field: Connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, and zinnia field.\n\nBased on this information, we can construct the following shortest path from the poppy field to the peony field: \n\nPoppy field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, zinnia field, peony field.\n\nAnswer: Poppy field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, zinnia field, peony field."
