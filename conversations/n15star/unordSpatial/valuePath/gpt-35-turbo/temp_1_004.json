The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will consider the number of flowers as the weight of each edge.\n\n1. Initialize a distance array with infinity values for all fields except the rose field, which is set to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and enqueue the rose field with a distance of 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the field with the minimum distance.\n   b. For each neighbor of the dequeued field:\n      - Calculate the distance to the neighbor by adding the weight of the edge (number of flowers) to the distance of the dequeued field.\n      - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor with the updated distance.\n4. After the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the rose field to all other fields.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm with the provided graph, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose -> Lily -> Chrysanthemum -> Poppy -> Lavender\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
