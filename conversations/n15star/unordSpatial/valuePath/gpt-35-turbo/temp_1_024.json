The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's break down the connections and determine the best path:\n\n1. Rose field is connected to: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Carnation field.\n\n2. Lily field is connected to: Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field.\n\n3. Chrysanthemum field is connected to: Poppy field.\n\n4. Poppy field is connected to: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, and Lavender field.\n\n5. Lavender field is connected to: Daisy field, Hydrangea field, and Marigold field.\n\n6. Daisy field is connected to: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, and Poppy field.\n\n7. Hydrangea field is connected to: Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Lavender field.\n\n8. Daffodil field is connected to: Marigold field and Lavender field.\n\n9. Marigold field is connected to: Lavender field.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of flowers in each field:\n\n- Rose field: Rose (unknown quantity).\n- Lily field: Lily (unknown quantity).\n- Chrysanthemum field: Chrysanthemum (unknown quantity).\n- Poppy field: Poppy (unknown quantity).\n- Carnation field: Carnation (unknown quantity).\n- Lavender field: Lavender (10 flowers).\n- Daisy field: Daisy (unknown quantity).\n- Hydrangea field: Hydrangea (unknown quantity).\n- Daffodil field: Daffodil (unknown quantity).\n- Marigold field: Marigold (unknown quantity).\n\nBased on the given information, the path that yields the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nRose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Lavender field\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
