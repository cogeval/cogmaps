The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the rose field as the starting point.\n3. Initialize a distance dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the rose field to each field, with the distance to the rose field set to 0 and all other distances set to infinity.\n4. Initialize a previous dictionary to keep track of the previous field in the shortest path, with all fields set to None.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the field with the shortest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the rose field to the neighboring field, taking into account the number of flowers obtained.\n     - If the calculated distance is shorter than the current distance in the distance dictionary:\n       - Update the distance dictionary with the new distance.\n       - Update the previous dictionary with the current field as the previous field for the neighboring field.\n       - Add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n6. Once all fields have been visited, construct the shortest path from the rose field to the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n7. Starting from the field with the maximum number of flowers, follow the previous dictionary to find the shortest path back to the rose field.\n8. List the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
