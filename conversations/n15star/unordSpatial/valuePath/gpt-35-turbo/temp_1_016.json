The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges. Assign a weight to each edge representing the number of flowers you can get from that path.\n\n2. Initialize the distances of all nodes except the starting node (rose field) to infinity and the distance of the starting node to 0.\n\n3. While there are unvisited nodes, select the node with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.\n\n4. For each neighboring node of the current node, calculate the total distance from the starting node through the current node. If this distance is smaller than the previously calculated distance, update the distance of the neighboring node.\n\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until all nodes have been visited.\n\n6. Trace back the shortest path by starting from the ending node (peony field) and following the nodes with decreasing distances until you reach the starting node (rose field).\n\nBased on the connections provided, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Peony"
