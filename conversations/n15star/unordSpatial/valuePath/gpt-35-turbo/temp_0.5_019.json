The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a priority queue and set the distance of the rose field to 0, and the distance of all other fields to infinity.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance to the neighboring field by adding the number of flowers in the current field to the number of flowers in the neighboring field.\n     - If the calculated distance is less than the current distance of the neighboring field, update its distance and add it to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest path from the rose field to all other fields, considering the number of flowers.\n5. Find the field with the maximum number of flowers and trace back the path from the rose field to that field.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
