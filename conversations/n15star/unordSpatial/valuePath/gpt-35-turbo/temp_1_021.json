The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Since we can only take one bunch of flowers from one field, we need to calculate the number of flowers we can get at each field.\n\nStarting from the Rose field, we have the following options:\n1. Rose field -> Lily field (0 flowers)\n2. Rose field -> Chrysanthemum field (0 flowers)\n3. Rose field -> Poppy field (0 flowers)\n4. Rose field -> Carnation field (0 flowers)\n5. Rose field -> Daisy field (0 flowers)\n\nFrom these options, we can see that we cannot get any flowers from the Rose field. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the Rose field is Answer: None."
