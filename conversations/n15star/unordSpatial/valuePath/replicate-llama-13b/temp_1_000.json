The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

All situated far away as one of the options are two gardens separated from both locations of a different distance, let's keep that option free but not dismissive by priorities so poppy filed is considered then to rule the rest out due to its connection being 2 gardens from lily field then all remaining garden with a different connecting field in their option has no priority, giving Orchid field connection less, chrysanthemum's a peony connections lesser and lavender field without priorities at hand so with this knowledge the poppy filed with free options and the closeness with lily fields let the Rosefield gives me the best and feasible selection by  Rule No. 2 because chatting away from this would have the flower at an arm's length away so let's set it apart, our options prioritize poppy field; thus Rule (no2, poppy).
