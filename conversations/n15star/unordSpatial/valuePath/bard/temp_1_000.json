The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Start at the rose field.\n2. Find all the fields that are connected to the rose field.\n3. From those fields, find the field that offers the most flowers.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach a field that does not offer any flowers.\n\nIn this case, the path would be:\n\n```\nrose -> lavender\n```\n\nThis path includes 2 flowers, and the lavender field offers the most flowers, so this is the best option.\n\nThe regular expression for the output is `Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+`. This means that the output should be a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of flower names. The flower names should be in alphabetical order, and the last flower name should be \"rose\".\n\nSo, the final output for this problem would be:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, lavender\n```\n\nHowever, I have made a mistake in my previous response. I mistakenly calculated the number of flowers in the lavender field as 10, when it is actually 60. This means that the best path is actually to go to the peony field, which offers 50 flowers.\n\nThe correct shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field is:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, peony (60 flowers)\n```\n\nThis path includes 2 flowers, and the peony field offers the most flowers, so this is the best option.\n\nThe regular expression for the output is `Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+`. This means that the output should be a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of flower names. The flower names should be in alphabetical order, and the last flower name should be \"rose\".\n\nSo, the final output for this problem would be:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, peony\n```\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
