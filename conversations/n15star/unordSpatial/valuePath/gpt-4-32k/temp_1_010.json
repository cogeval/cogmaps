The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

These are lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\nStep 2: Identify the paths from these fields to the peony and lavender fields.\n  a) From lily field: No direct connections.\n  b) From chrysanthemum field: No direct connections.\n  c) From poppy field: No direct connections.\n  d) From carnation field: Connected to zinnia field, which in turn is connected to peony field.\n\nStep 3: Determine the shortest path that leads to either the peony field or lavender field.\n  a) The shortest path to the peony field is through the carnation field and zinnia field (rose -> carnation -> zinnia -> peony).\n  b) No direct path to the lavender field is available from the rose field or any of its connected fields.\n\nStep 4: Compare the number of flowers obtained from each path.\n  a) Peony field yields 50 flowers.\n  b) No path to lavender field is available, so it is not considered.\n\nStep 5: Choose the path that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n  a) The path to the peony field yields the maximum number of flowers (50).\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony"
