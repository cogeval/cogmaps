Start at the zinnia field.\n2. Check its connections: zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field.\n3. Add the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field to the queue.\n4. Take the first field from the queue, which is the sunflower field.\n5. Check its connections: sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field (already visited).\n6. Add the orchid field, peony field, and carnation field to the queue.\n7. Take the next field from the queue, which is the peony field.\n8. Check its connections: peony field is connected to the zinnia field (already visited).\n9. Add the zinnia field to the queue.\n10. Take the next field from the queue, which is the carnation field.\n11. Check its connections: carnation field is connected to the zinnia field (already visited).\n12. Add the zinnia field to the queue.\n13. Take the next field from the queue, which is the orchid field.\n14. Check its connections: orchid field is connected to the peony field (already visited).\n15. Continue this process until we reach the rose field.\n\nThe shortest path from the zinnia field to the rose field is: zinnia, carnation, zinnia, peony, zinnia, rose.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony, Zinnia, Rose"
