The peony field is connected to the zinnia field, and the zinnia field is not connected to any other fields.\n\nNext, we can find the connections from the peony field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field and the zinnia field is not connected to any other fields.\n\nFinally, let's find the connections from the zinnia field. The zinnia field is connected to the carnation field, poppy field, and peony field. \n\nBased on the connections we've identified, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the rose field would be:\nSunflower, Orchid, Carnation, Zinnia, Poppy, Chrysanthemum, Lily, Rose.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Orchid, Carnation, Zinnia, Poppy, Chrysanthemum, Lily, Rose."
