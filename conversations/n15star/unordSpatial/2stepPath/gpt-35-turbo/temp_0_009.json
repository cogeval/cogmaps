Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\n- Poppy field: connected to the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field.\n- Lily field: connected to the daisy field, chrysanthemum field, and poppy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the rose field, lily field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n- Rose field: connected to the lily field and chrysanthemum field.\n- Daisy field: connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field.\n- Lavender field: connected to the daisy field, marigold field, and hydrangea field.\n- Marigold field: connected to the lavender field and hydrangea field.\n- Hydrangea field: connected to the marigold field, daffodil field, and lavender field.\n- Daffodil field: connected to the hydrangea field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- Orchid field: connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Peony field: connected to the tulip field, orchid field, and zinnia field.\n- Tulip field: connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n- Zinnia field: connected to the sunflower field, orchid field, carnation field, and peony field.\n- Sunflower field: connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- Carnation field: connected to the rose field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, orchid field, and zinnia field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the poppy field to the lavender field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the poppy field.\n2. Add the poppy field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the lavender field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the poppy field to the lavender field.\n\nUsing the breadth-first search algorithm, the shortest path from the poppy field to the lavender field is:\n\nPoppy field, Daisy field, Lavender field.\n\nAnswer: Poppy field, Daisy field, Lavender field."
