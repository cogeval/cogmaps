Start at the rose field.\n2. Initialize the distance to all other fields as infinity, except the distance to the rose field as 0.\n3. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store the fields and their distances.\n4. Add the rose field to the priority queue.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the extracted field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the extracted field to the neighboring field.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring field, update its distance in the priority queue.\n6. Once the orchid field is reached, terminate the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path from the rose field to the orchid field is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Daisy, Orchid"
