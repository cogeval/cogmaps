Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n3. From the rose field, we can choose any of these fields to continue. Let's choose the lily field.\n4. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n5. From the lily field, we can choose the chrysanthemum field.\n6. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n7. From the chrysanthemum field, we can choose the poppy field.\n8. The poppy field is connected to the daisy field.\n9. We have reached the daisy field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the daisy field is: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy"
