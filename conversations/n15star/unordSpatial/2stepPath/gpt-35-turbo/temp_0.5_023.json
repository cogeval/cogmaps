Check if the current field is the rose field. If it is, stop the search.\n3. If not, check the neighboring fields connected to the current field.\n4. Enqueue the neighboring fields that haven't been visited yet.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the rose field is found or all fields have been visited.\n6. Retrieve the path from the zinnia field to the rose field.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from the zinnia field to the rose field:\n\n1.
