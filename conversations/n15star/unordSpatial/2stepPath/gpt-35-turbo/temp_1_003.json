Rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n2. Lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n3. Chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n4. Poppy field is connected to the carnation field.\n5. Carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n\nBased on these connections, we can determine the shortest path from the rose field to the zinnia field as follows:\n\nRose field -> Carnation field -> Zinnia field\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the zinnia field, including the rose, can be listed as:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia"
