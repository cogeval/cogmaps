Let's start from the zinnia field and follow the connections until we reach the tulip field.\n\nStarting from the zinnia field, the available connections are: peony field, carnation field.\n\nFrom the peony field, the available connections are: zinnia field.\n\nSince the zinnia field is already visited, we cannot go back to it. Therefore, we need to backtrack to the previous field, which is the zinnia field.\n\nNext, from the carnation field, the available connections are: zinnia field.\n\nAgain, we have already visited the zinnia field, so we need to backtrack to the carnation field.\n\nFinally, from the zinnia field, the available connections are: peony field, carnation field.\n\nFrom the peony field, the available connections are: zinnia field.\n\nWe have already visited the zinnia field, so we need to backtrack to the peony field.\n\nFrom the carnation field, the available connections are: zinnia field.\n\nFinally, from the zinnia field, the available connections are: peony field.\n\nFrom the peony field, the available connections are: zinnia field, carnation field.\n\nWe have already visited the zinnia field, so we need to backtrack to the peony field.\n\nFrom the carnation field, the available connections are: zinnia field.\n\nWe have already visited the zinnia field, so we need to backtrack to the carnation field.\n\nWe have visited all the fields except for the tulip field. Therefore, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the tulip field is: zinnia, peony, zinnia, carnation, zinnia, peony, zinnia, carnation.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Peony, Zinnia, Carnation, Zinnia, Peony, Zinnia, Carnation."
