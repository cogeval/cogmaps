The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

Starting from the rose field, we can see that it is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n2. From the rose field, we will choose the path that leads to the zinnia field. Since the carnation field is connected to the zinnia field, we will choose the path through the carnation field.\n3. Following the path, we move from the rose field to the carnation field.\n4. From the carnation field, we can see that it is connected to the zinnia field.\n5. We have reached the zinnia field, which is our destination.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the zinnia field is: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia"
