Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Poppy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field\n- Carnation field: Zinnia field\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Peony field: Zinnia field\n- Zinnia field: (no connections)\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Marigold field: Lavender field\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Lavender field: (no connections)\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the rose field to the sunflower field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Add the rose field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the sunflower field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark the dequeued field as visited.\n4. If the algorithm finishes without finding the sunflower field, there is no path from the rose field to the sunflower field.\n\nUsing the breadth-first search algorithm, the shortest path from the rose field to the sunflower field is:\n\nRose field, Carnation field, Zinnia field, Sunflower field\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Carnation field, Zinnia field, Sunflower field"
