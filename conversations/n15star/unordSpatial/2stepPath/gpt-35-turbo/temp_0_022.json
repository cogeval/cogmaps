Add the sunflower field, peony field, and carnation field to the queue.\n4. Take the first field from the queue, which is the sunflower field.\n5. Check its connections: sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n6. Add the orchid field to the queue.\n7. Take the next field from the queue, which is the peony field.\n8. Check its connections: peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n9. Since the zinnia field is already visited, we skip it.\n10. Take the next field from the queue, which is the carnation field.\n11. Check its connections: carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n12.
