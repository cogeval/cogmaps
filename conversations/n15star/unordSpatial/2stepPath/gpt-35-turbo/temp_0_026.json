Start at the tulip field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field: hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue the first field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the orchid field, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, check the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited.\n   - Add the unvisited neighboring fields to the queue and mark them as visited.\n   - Update the path by appending the current field to the previous path.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and the orchid field is not found, there is no path from the tulip field to the orchid field.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from the tulip field to the orchid field is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Hydrangea, Orchid"
