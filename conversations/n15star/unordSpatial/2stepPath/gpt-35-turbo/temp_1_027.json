Let's map out the connections:\n\n- The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n- The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field.\n- The marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n- The lavender field is not directly connected to the zinnia field.\n\nSince the lavender field is not directly connected to the zinnia field, we need to find an indirect path. \n\nOne possible path from the tulip field to the zinnia field is as follows:\nTulip field -> Hydrangea field -> Lavender field -> Marigold field -> Carnation field -> Zinnia field\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Hydrangea, Lavender, Marigold, Carnation, Zinnia"
