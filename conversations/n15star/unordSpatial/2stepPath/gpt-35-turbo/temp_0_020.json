Start at the peony field.\n2. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n3. The zinnia field is not directly connected to the daffodil field, so we need to explore further.\n4. From the zinnia field, we can go to the sunflower field.\n5. The sunflower field is not directly connected to the daffodil field, so we need to explore further.\n6. From the sunflower field, we can go to the orchid field.\n7. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, which is a dead end as we have already visited it.\n8. From the orchid field, we can go to the carnation field.\n9. The carnation field is not directly connected to the daffodil field, so we need to explore further.\n10. From the carnation field, we can go to the zinnia field.\n11. The zinnia field is connected to the daffodil field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the peony field to the daffodil field is: Peony, Zinnia, Carnation, Zinnia, Daffodil.\n\nAnswer: Peony, Zinnia, Carnation, Zinnia, Daffodil."
