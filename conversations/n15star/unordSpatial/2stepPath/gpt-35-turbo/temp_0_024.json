Start at the tulip field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field: hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue in the order they were discovered: hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony.\n4. Mark the tulip field as visited.\n5. Dequeue the first field from the queue (hydrangea).\n6. Check if the dequeued field is the lavender field. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n7. If the dequeued field is not the lavender field, check its neighboring fields: daffodil, marigold, and lavender.\n8. Add the neighboring fields to the queue if they have not been visited before: daffodil, marigold, and lavender.\n9. Mark the dequeued field (hydrangea) as visited.\n10. Repeat steps 5-9 until the lavender field is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from the tulip field to the lavender field is:\n\nTulip, Hydrangea, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Hydrangea, Lavender"
