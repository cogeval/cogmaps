This means that fields will be stored in a tree structure. We can use a tree structure where we have a root at each fields. Then the rest of fields are the left or right subtrees. If a parent field (which has a value like flower2) has the child fields, then we put an array at the parent. The children are the strings that need to be concatenated with the parent to output the result. When finding the path, we can do binary search by comparing the left child and the right child based on the input value from the user, in this case the rose field in the input. We need to find the closest parent that can store the string given in the input. So we can just do something like this. Then just repeat until there is no match."
