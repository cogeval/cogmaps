No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Peony field: connected to zinnia field. No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Carnation field: connected to zinnia field. No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n\nSince there is no direct connection from the sunflower field to the tulip field, we need to check the next level of connections:\n\n- Orchid field -> Peony field: connected to zinnia field. No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Orchid field -> Carnation field: connected to zinnia field. No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Orchid field -> Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Peony field -> Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Carnation field -> Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n\nStill no connection to the tulip field, so we need to check the next level of connections:\n\n- Orchid field -> Peony field -> Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n- Orchid field -> Carnation field -> Zinnia field: No direct connection to tulip field.\n\nAt this point, we have exhausted all possible connections from the sunflower field without finding a path to the tulip field. This indicates that there is a missing connection in the given information, and we cannot determine the shortest path from the sunflower field to the tulip field based on the provided data.\n\nAnswer: Unable to determine path"
