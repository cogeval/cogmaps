There isn't any.\nStep 4: Check the connections of Peony (Zinnia), Carnation (Zinnia), and Zinnia (Peony, Carnation) for a path to the Tulip field. There isn't any.\nStep 5: Check the connections of the Sunflower field (Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia) for a path to the Tulip field. There isn't any.\nStep 6: Check the connections of the Rose field (Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation) for a path to the Tulip field. There isn't any.\nStep 7: Check the connections of the Daisy field (Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender) for a path to the Tulip field. There isn't any.\nStep 8: Check the connections of the Hydrangea field (Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender) for a path to the Tulip field. Found it! Hydrangea is connected to the Tulip field.\nStep 9: Now we need to find the shortest path from Orchid to Hydrangea. Orchid is connected to the Sunflower field, which is connected to the Carnation field, which is connected to the Rose field, which is connected to the Lily field, which is connected to the Chrysanthemum field, which is connected to the Poppy field, which is connected to the Daisy field, which is connected to the Lavender field, which is connected to the Marigold field, which is connected to the Daffodil field, and finally to the Hydrangea field.\nStep 10: Combine the path from Orchid to Hydrangea and from Hydrangea to Tulip.\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Sunflower, Carnation, Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy, Lavender, Marigold, Daffodil, Hydrangea, Tulip"
