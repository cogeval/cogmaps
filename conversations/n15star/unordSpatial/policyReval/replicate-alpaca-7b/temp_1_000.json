The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From there, they can also opt to go to the peony field to get five more more while avoiding the sunflowers, and instead take the less crowded path connecting other flower Fields including the orchid, daisy,lavender, tuberoses and then to the zinnia Field. This path will yield a maximum number Of fifteen flowers.  The final outcome is that one cannot miss out on a rose if taken from the rose Garden yet be able gather enough from other flower fields and get a bunch. Thus, one should try picking flowers from different Fields in a loop, making sure at any time to keep 5 of the same flower type to complete on bouquet. At the end, after visiting each Field and taking only one bunch each time from a specific Field including rose, lily and so on, the full bunch will bring us to an expected value Of five roses, five daffodils and five lavenders. Furthermore, going for the second or thirteen more will only add poppies on the full final result.Having visited all fields, it'd mean we reached a highest achievable number of flowers- a bouquet of fourteen, where all fourteen are unique due to their individual connections from one Field (rose) and looping paths to various Fields. Visiting each and every flower Garden will give rise to fifteen different flowers, with fourteen peasants in full, along with an expected five roses in all as the one true leader in the loop while avoiding any duplication from any specialty fields.  It\u2019s up to how soon and by How many Fields is our desired end result reached and thus our bouquet full.\n\nAnswer: 5 roses, 5 daffodils & 5 lavenders. Taking each 5 flowers from Rose, Lily and Peony and five others respectively in different orders and Fields to achieve variety in flowers and avoid any repeats for a single bouquet. As long as a person has been attentive to detail from every flower field and connecting passages between, getting their flowers without having to worry where a blooming lot was located before, visiting each and every one before creating their desired full bouquet of Fourteen from fourteen Fields- becoming truly diversified in all counts since the path ways between was uniquily one of its type from only One single Rose. From the lot of different flora bloomed here the path ways"
