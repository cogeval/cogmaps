Initially, there are 50 coins in the jar, 5 gold coins, 25 silver coins, and 10 bronze coins. Each successive round, a coin is selected at random and one of the coins that are in the jar is flipped at random (a gold coin, the next coin up, say from the tenth position from the top). The coin is kept face up if it is gold. It is flipped over if it is bronze. This process is done until all of the faces are known and there are only 5 bronze coins left in the jar. It can take several rounds. Now, what is the probability of the number of gold coins at the end of round 2 being greater than the number of gold coins at the end of round 1?\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
