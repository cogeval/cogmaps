The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field and there is no bunch of flowers for free for visiting chrysanthemum field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

A regular expression is not just a way to select parts of a string. If you have a look at the [tag:regex] tag wiki you can find examples on how to use regular expressions for specific tasks. In your program you do not use a regex. It is just a plain string comparator.\n\nComment: I edited the code in the beginning of the file and moved the regular expression into `match()` function. Could you please take a look and let me know in case it has broken? :)\n\nAnswer: \\section{Regular expressions}\n\nIt looks like you're matching based on your regular expression. That's not a very good idea. In Python, you can use a regular expression in your code. But there's no need to do so for your problem. It's very inefficient to look for a pattern in a string using regular expressions. It can be much faster to do things like split the whole string up into all words - like you're doing.\n\nYour code looks like this at the end:\n\n\\begin{code}\n['rose','daffodil','hyang',]\n\\end{code}\n\nThat is not correct as a python list. The values are separated by commas, which is incorrect. The correct format is `[name_1,name_2,'name_n]`. So, change these at the end to:\n\n\\begin{code}\n['rose', 'daffodil', 'hyang',"
