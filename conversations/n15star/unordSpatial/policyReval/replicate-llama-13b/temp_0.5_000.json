The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here's how I would approach the problem step by step:\n1. First, I will explore the fields that are connected to the rose field. These are the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n2. Next, I will explore each of these fields and take note of the flowers that I can collect. From the lily field, I can collect lily flowers. From the chrysanthemum field, I can collect chrysanthemum flowers. From the poppy field, I can collect poppy flowers. And from the carnation field, I can collect carnation flowers.\n3. After exploring all of the fields connected to the rose field, I will choose the field that yields the maximum number of flowers. Based on the information provided, the field with the most flowers is the peony field, so I will choose to visit the peony field.\n4. Once I arrive at the peony field, I will collect 50 peony flowers and then return to the rose field.\n5. Since I only want to collect one bunch of flowers and I already have 50 peony flowers, I will not visit any other fields.\nAnswer: Rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation, peony."
