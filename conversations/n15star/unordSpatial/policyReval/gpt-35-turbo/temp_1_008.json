The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a list of distances from the starting field. Initially, set the distance of the starting field to 0 and the distance of all other fields to infinity.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n4. While there are unvisited fields:\n   a. Choose the field with the smallest distance from the starting field. This field will be the current field.\n   b. Add the current field to the visited set.\n   c. For each field connected to the current field:\n      - Calculate the distance from the starting field to the connected field through the current field.\n      - If this distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance to the connected field, update the distance.\n5. Once all fields have been visited, we have the shortest path from the rose field to each field. \n\nLet's go through the steps to find the shortest path from the rose field to each field and determine the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have:\n   - Distance to rose: 0\n\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field. Let's calculate the distances to these fields:\n   - Distance to lily: 1\n   - Distance to chrysanthemum: 1\n   - Distance to poppy: 1\n   - Distance to carnation: 1\n\n3. The shortest distance among the connected fields is 1, so we choose the lily field as the next field.\n\n4. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. Let's calculate the distances to these fields:\n   - Distance to chrysanthemum: 2\n   - Distance to poppy: 2\n\n5. The shortest distance among the connected fields is still 2, so we choose the chrysanthemum field as the next field.\n\n6. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field. Let's calculate the distance to the poppy field:\n   - Distance to poppy: 3\n\n7. The shortest distance among the connected fields is now 3, so we choose the poppy field as the next field.\n\n8. The poppy field is connected to the lily field and carnation field. Let's calculate the distances to these fields:\n   - Distance to lily: 4\n   - Distance to carnation: 4\n\n9. The shortest distance among the connected fields is 4, so we choose the lily field as the next field.\n\n10. The lily field is already visited, so we move on to the next connected field, carnation.\n\n11. The carnation field is not connected to any other field, so we have completed the shortest path from the rose field.\n\nThe shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, lily, carnation.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Carnation"
