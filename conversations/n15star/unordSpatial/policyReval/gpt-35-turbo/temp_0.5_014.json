The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n3. For each neighboring field, calculate the number of flowers we can collect if we visit that field. Since we can only take one bunch of flowers, we will choose the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n4. Move to the chosen field and repeat steps 2 and 3 until we reach the desired number of flowers or there are no more unvisited fields.\n5. Return the path of fields we visited, including the rose field, separated by commas.\n\nBased on the given information, let's calculate the number of flowers we can collect from each field:\n\n- Rose field: 0 flowers (starting point)\n- Lily field: 0 flowers\n- Chrysanthemum field: 0 flowers\n- Poppy field: 0 flowers\n- Carnation field: 0 flowers\n- Sunflower field: 0 flowers\n- Orchid field: 0 flowers\n- Peony field: 50 flowers (maximum number of flowers)\n- Zinnia field: 0 flowers\n- Tulip field: 0 flowers\n- Hydrangea field: 0 flowers\n- Daffodil field: 0 flowers\n- Marigold field: 0 flowers\n- Daisy field: 0 flowers\n- Lavender field: 10 flowers (maximum number of flowers)\n\nBased on the calculations, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Peony\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony"
