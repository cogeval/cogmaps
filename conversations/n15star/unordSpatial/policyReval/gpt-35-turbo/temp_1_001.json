The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the shortest path with the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Calculate the total number of flowers that can be obtained from each neighboring field.\n   - The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n   - From the lily field, there are no free flowers available.\n   - From the chrysanthemum field, there are no free flowers available.\n   - From the poppy field, there are no free flowers available.\n   - From the carnation field, there are no free flowers available.\n\n3. Since there are no free flowers available in any neighboring field, we will choose the field with the shortest path to continue.\n   - The lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field all have a distance of 1 from the rose field.\n\n4. From the chosen field, repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no neighboring fields left to explore.\n   - Since there are no neighboring fields with free flowers, the exploration ends here.\n\nTherefore, the path starting from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: rose"
