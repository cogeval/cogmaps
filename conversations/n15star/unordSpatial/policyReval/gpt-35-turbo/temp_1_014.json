The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields. \n   - Since we want to maximize the number of flowers, we will not choose the lily or chrysanthemum fields because they have fewer connected fields compared to poppy and carnation fields.\n   - Choose either the poppy or carnation field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n3. Let's choose the poppy field from the rose field.\n4. The poppy field is connected to the daisy field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, and lavender field.\n   - Since we have already chosen the lily field, we will not choose it again.\n   - Choose the lavender field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n5. Choose the lavender field from the poppy field.\n6. The lavender field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and rose field.\n   - We have already visited the rose field, so we cannot choose it again.\n   - Choose either the daffodil or marigold field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n7. Let's choose the daffodil field from the lavender field.\n8. The daffodil field is connected to the hydrangea field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n   - We have already visited the lavender field, so we cannot choose it again.\n   - Choose the hydrangea field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n9. Choose the hydrangea field from the daffodil field.\n10. The hydrangea field is connected to the tulip field, daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n    - We have already visited the daffodil and marigold fields, so we cannot choose them again.\n    - Choose the tulip field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n11. Choose the tulip field from the hydrangea field.\n12. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n    - We have already visited the hydrangea and daffodil fields, so we cannot choose them again.\n    - Choose the peony field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n13. Choose the peony field from the tulip field.\n14. The peony field is connected to the orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n    - We have already visited the carnation field, so we cannot choose it again.\n    - Choose either the orchid or zinnia field based on the availability of connected fields.\n\n15. Let's choose the zinnia field from the peony field.\n16. The zinnia field is not connected to any other fields, so we have reached the end of the path.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is: rose, poppy, lavender, daffodil, hydrangea, tulip, peony, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Lavender, Daffodil, Hydrangea, Tulip, Peony, Zinnia."
