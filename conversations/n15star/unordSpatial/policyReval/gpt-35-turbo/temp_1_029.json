The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will visit each field only once and choose the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nBased on the given information, the connections between fields are as follows:\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Poppy field: Lavender field\n- Lavender field: Marigold field\n- Marigold field: Zinnia field\n\nUsing the breadth-first search algorithm, we can explore the paths from the rose field to all the other fields and calculate the number of flowers obtained along each path.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with the rose field as the starting point.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained along each path.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of flowers obtained.\n4. Initialize an empty list to store the flower names in order.\n\n5. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 6-9.\n6. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n7. Check if the field has not been visited before.\n8. If the field has not been visited before, calculate the number of flowers obtained along the path from the rose field to the current field. Update the maximum number of flowers if necessary.\n9. Enqueue the connected fields of the current field into the queue.\n\n10. Starting from the field with the maximum number of flowers, trace back the path by selecting the field with the maximum number of flowers at each step until reaching the rose field.\n11. Append the flower names in reverse order to the list of flower names.\n12. Reverse the list of flower names to obtain the flower names in the correct order.\n\nFinally, we can provide the flower names in order starting from the rose field:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Marigold, Zinnia, Peony"
