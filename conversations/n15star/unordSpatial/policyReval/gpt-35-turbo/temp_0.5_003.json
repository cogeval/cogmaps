The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Among these options, we want to choose the field that allows us to obtain the maximum number of flowers. \n\n3. Looking at the connections, we see that the peony field is connected to both the rose field and the orchid field. We know that we can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if we visit the peony field.\n\n4. Therefore, the optimal choice is to visit the peony field from the rose field, as it allows us to obtain the maximum number of flowers.\n\n5. After visiting the peony field, we have obtained a bunch of peony flowers. Now, we need to determine the next field to visit.\n\n6. Looking at the connections from the peony field, we see that it is connected to the zinnia field. However, the zinnia field does not offer any additional free flowers.\n\n7. Therefore, the optimal choice is to end our path at the peony field, as it allows us to obtain the maximum number of flowers.\n\n8. In summary, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony"

Starting from the rose field, we know that it is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n\n2. Among these options, we want to choose the field that allows us to obtain the maximum number of flowers.\n\n3. Previously, the peony field was the optimal choice as it offered a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free. However, with the updated information, we need to reassess our options.\n\n4. Looking at the connections from the rose field, we see that the chrysanthemum field is now a potential candidate. It is connected to the rose field and offers a bunch of 100 chrysanthemum flowers for free.\n\n5. Therefore, the optimal choice is to visit the chrysanthemum field from the rose field, as it allows us to obtain a greater number of flowers compared to the peony field.\n\n6. After visiting the chrysanthemum field, we have obtained a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers. Now, we need to determine the next field to visit.\n\n7. Looking at the connections from the chrysanthemum field, we see that it is connected to the poppy field. However, the poppy field does not offer any additional free flowers.\n\n8. Therefore, the optimal choice is to end our path at the chrysanthemum field, as it allows us to obtain the maximum number of flowers.\n\n9. In summary, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the updated number of chrysanthemum flowers, is: rose, chrysanthemum.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum"
