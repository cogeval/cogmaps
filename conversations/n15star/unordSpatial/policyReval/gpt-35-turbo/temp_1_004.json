The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the rose field, we can choose either the chrysanthemum or the poppy field since they both yield a maximum of 50 flowers.\n\n    - If we choose the chrysanthemum field, we have the following options for the next field:\n      - Lily field: Not a valid choice since we can't get any flowers from there.\n      - Poppy field: A valid choice that allows us to get 50 flowers.\n\n    - If we choose the poppy field, we have the following options for the next field:\n      - Lily field: Not a valid choice since we can't get any flowers from there.\n      - Chrysanthemum field: A valid choice that allows us to get 50 flowers.\n\n2. Since both options lead to the same number of flowers, we can choose either the chrysanthemum field or the poppy field as our next destination.\n\n3. From either the chrysanthemum field or the poppy field, the next best field to visit would be the carnation field. However, none of the subsequent connections from the carnation field will yield more than 50 flowers, so it is not the optimal choice.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy"
