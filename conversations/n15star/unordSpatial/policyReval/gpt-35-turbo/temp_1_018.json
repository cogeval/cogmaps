The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We need to evaluate the number of flowers we can get from each of these fields:\n\n1. Lily Field: Since the lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field, we should visit these fields to maximize our flower count.\n2. Chrysanthemum Field: Since the chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field, we should visit the poppy field next.\n3. Poppy Field: The poppy field is connected to the lavender field, so we should visit the lavender field next to get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n4. Lavender Field: From the lavender field, we have multiple options to consider. However, since we can only choose one field, we should select the field that will give us the maximum number of flowers. Let's analyze the options:\n   - The lavender field is connected to the daisy field, which leads to the lily field. However, we have already visited the lily field and received the maximum number of flowers from there.\n   - The lavender field is also connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, and marigold field. Of these options, the marigold field will provide us with a bunch of flowers for free. Therefore, we should visit the marigold field next.\n5. Marigold Field: There are no more fields connected to the marigold field, so we have completed our route.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is as follows: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Marigold"
