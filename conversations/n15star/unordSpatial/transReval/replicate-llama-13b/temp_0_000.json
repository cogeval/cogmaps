You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

I want to thank the whole team for creating such a realistic scenario. You're probably thinking I'm giving the task some credit for my failure because after all, it's all good competition. It might not feel so good going from a task that is so clear and real to one that's so very... well, \"what?\" Let me see if I can clarify.
