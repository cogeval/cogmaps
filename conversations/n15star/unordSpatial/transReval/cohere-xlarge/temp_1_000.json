The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

I really appreciate your approach to solving problems.\n\nIf you do not mind, I would like to ask you about this problem. In the first part of the task we need to find the shortest path from the rose field. The solution is relatively easy. It is a path with 3 segments: rose, lilies and sunflowers. The next part is more difficult for me. I do not know how to describe the problem in an algorithm. I would like to do it with the following code:\n\nAnd how would you do it? Could you share your solution with me? I would like to know your opinion.\n\nHi! In my solution, I used the following steps: 1. First, I solved the task with the solution that was given to me. 2. I had to figure out how to solve the problem, so I tried to find a way to do it with a simpler algorithm. 3. I used the same algorithm as the solution that was given to me. 4. I had to find a way to solve the problem with the algorithm that was given to me. 5. I had to find a way to solve the problem"
