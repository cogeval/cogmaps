The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize a list of distances for each field, where the distance of the rose field is 0 and the distance of all other fields is infinity.\n2. Create a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the rose field as the only element with a distance of 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n     a. Extract the field with the shortest distance from the priority queue.\n     b. For each neighboring field that is connected to the current field:\n          i. Calculate the total distance to reach the neighboring field from the current field, considering the flowers that can be obtained.\n          ii. If this distance is shorter than the current distance of the neighboring field, update its distance and add it to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, we can trace back the shortest path starting from the rose field by following the minimum distance from each field to its previous field.\n5. Concatenate the flower names from the fields in the shortest path, including the rose field, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1.

Extract (lily, 1) from the priority queue.\n\n   3b. For each neighboring field connected to lily: (chrysanthemum, 2), (poppy, 2)\n\n      For (chrysanthemum, 2):\n      - Calculate total distance: 3\n      - Update distance of chrysanthemum field to 3\n      - Add (chrysanthemum, 3) to the priority queue\n\n      For (poppy, 2):\n      - Calculate total distance: 3\n      - Update distance of poppy field to 3\n      - Add (poppy, 3) to the priority queue\n\n   ...
