The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We'll start by creating a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges. We'll also assign weights to the edges based on the number of flowers we can get from each field.\n\nThe graph representation is as follows:\n- Rose field: connected to Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Carnation field.\n- Lily field: connected to Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to Poppy field.\n- Poppy field: connected to Carnation field.\n- Carnation field: connected to Zinnia field.\n- Zinnia field: no connections.\n- Orchid field: connected to Peony field and Carnation field.\n- Peony field: connected to Zinnia field.\n- Sunflower field: connected to Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, and Zinnia field.\n- Tulip field: connected to Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Peony field.\n- Hydrangea field: connected to Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Lavender field.\n- Daffodil field: connected to Marigold field and Lavender field.\n- Marigold field: connected to Lavender field.\n- Lavender field: no connections.\n- Daisy field: connected to Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Lavender field.\n\nNow, we'll apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. Starting from the Rose field, we'll calculate the shortest path to each connected field, taking into account the number of flowers we can get from each field.\n\n1. Start at the Rose field.\n2.
