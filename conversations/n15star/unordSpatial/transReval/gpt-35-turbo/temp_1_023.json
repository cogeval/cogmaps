The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We start from the rose field and keep track of the distances to each neighboring field. We also keep track of the number of flowers we can obtain from each field. \n\nStarting from the rose field:\n1. The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Since we can only obtain flowers from the peony and lavender fields, we don't consider the chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n3. We can obtain 50 peony flowers from the peony field, but 0 lavender flowers from the lavender field.\n4. Moving to the lily field, which is connected to the chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n5. Since we can't obtain any flowers from these fields, we skip them.\n6. Next, we move to the carnation field.\n7. Since we can obtain 50 peony flowers from the peony field and 0 lavender flowers from the lavender field, the maximum number of flowers we can obtain is 50 peony flowers.\n8. Finally, we choose the carnation field as it gives us the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: \nRose, Carnation\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation"
