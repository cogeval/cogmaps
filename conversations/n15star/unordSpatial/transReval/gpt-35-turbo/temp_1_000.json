Since we are starting at Starbucks, let's assign a reward of 1 to Starbucks and 0 to all other stores. Then we can traverse the map, adding up the rewards as we go.\n\nStarting at Starbucks, we can go to Chickflea (reward 0), then to Baskins and Robins (reward 0), Levis (reward 0), GNC Live Well (reward 0), and finally to Target (reward 0). This path yields a total reward of 1.\n\nAnother possible path from Starbucks is to go to Paris Baguette (reward 0), H&M (reward 0), and Zara (reward 0). This path yields a total reward of 0.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from Starbucks is Starbucks, Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Target.\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, Target."
