The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Each flower field will be a node in the graph, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the flower county with 15 flower fields:\n   - Create nodes for each flower field: rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation, sunflower, orchid, peony, zinnia, tulip, hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, lavender, and daisy.\n   - Add edges to connect the fields based on the given connections.\n\n2. Calculate the shortest path from the rose field to each field using a shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).\n\n3. Calculate the maximum number of flowers that can be obtained from each field:\n   - For each field, calculate the total number of flowers that can be obtained by summing the number of flowers in that field plus the number of flowers in the fields along the shortest path from the rose field to that field.\n\n4. Determine the field with the maximum number of flowers.\n\n5. List the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas:\n   - Starting from the rose field, follow the shortest path to the field with the maximum number of flowers, listing the flower names along the way.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
