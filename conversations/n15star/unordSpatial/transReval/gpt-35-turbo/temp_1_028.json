The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge.\n2. Initialize the distance of the rose field as 0 and the distance of all other fields as infinity.\n3. Create a priority queue and add the rose field with a distance of 0 to it.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Pop the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the popped field, calculate the new distance as the sum of the popped field's distance and the weight of the edge between them.\n   - If the new distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring field, update the neighboring field's distance and add it to the priority queue.\n5. After the algorithm finishes, the shortest path to each field starting from the rose field will be stored in their respective distances.\n\nNow let's apply the algorithm step by step:\n\n1. The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Initialize the distance of the rose field as 0 and the distance of all other fields as infinity: rose: 0, lily: infinity, chrysanthemum: infinity, poppy: infinity, carnation: infinity.\n3. Add the rose field to the priority queue with a distance of 0: [(rose, 0)].\n4. Pop the rose field from the priority queue and process its neighboring fields:\n   - The distance from the rose field to the lily field is 1, which is smaller than the current distance of infinity. Update the distance of the lily field to 1 and add it to the priority queue: [(lily, 1)].\n   - The distance from the rose field to the chrysanthemum field is 1, which is smaller than the current distance of infinity. Update the distance of the chrysanthemum field to 1 and add it to the priority queue: [(lily, 1), (chrysanthemum, 1)].\n   - The distance from the rose field to the poppy field is 1, which is smaller than the current distance of infinity. Update the distance of the poppy field to 1 and add it to the priority queue: [(lily, 1), (chrysanthemum, 1), (poppy, 1)].\n   - The distance from the rose field to the carnation field is 1, which is smaller than the current distance of infinity. Update the distance of the carnation field to 1 and add it to the priority queue: [(lily, 1), (chrysanthemum, 1), (poppy, 1), (carnation, 1)].\n5. The priority queue is now empty. The shortest paths from the rose field are: rose -> lily, rose -> chrysanthemum, rose -> poppy, and rose -> carnation.\n\nTherefore, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation"
