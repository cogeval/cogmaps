The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, we will start by mapping out all the possible paths and their associated flower counts.\n\n1. Starting from the rose field:\n   a. We can visit the lily field (connected to the rose field) and obtain a bunch of lilies.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose)\n   b. We can visit the chrysanthemum field (connected to the rose field) and obtain a bunch of chrysanthemums.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose)\n   c. We can visit the poppy field (connected to the rose field) and obtain a bunch of poppies.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose)\n   d. We can visit the carnation field (connected to the rose field) and obtain a bunch of carnations.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose)\n\n2. Analyzing the options from the first step:\n   - We can eliminate the options that do not yield any additional flowers compared to the starting rose field.\n     Thus, we can remove visiting the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and poppy field.\n\n3. Continuing from the remaining option in step 1:\n   a. We can visit the orchid field (connected to the carnation field) and obtain a bunch of orchids.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose) + 1 (carnation)\n   b. We can visit the zinnia field (connected to the carnation field) and obtain a bunch of zinnias.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose) + 1 (carnation)\n   c. We can visit the peony field (connected to the carnation field) and obtain a bunch of peonies.\n      - Total flower count: 1 (rose) + 50 (peonies)\n\n4. Analyzing the options from the third step:\n   - We can eliminate the option of visiting the orchid field as it does not yield any additional flowers compared to visiting the zinnia field.\n   Thus, we will choose to visit the zinnia field.\n\nTherefore, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Answer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia."
