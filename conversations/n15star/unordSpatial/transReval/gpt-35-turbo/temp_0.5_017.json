The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will assign a weight to each edge representing the number of flowers that can be obtained from that connection. Let's start step by step:\n\n1. Assign a weight of 0 to the rose field.\n2. Assign a weight of infinity to all other fields.\n3. Set the current field as the rose field.\n4. Visit each connected field from the current field and update their weights if a shorter path is found.\n5. Mark the current field as visited.\n6. Select the unvisited field with the minimum weight as the new current field.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all fields have been visited.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Assign a weight of 0 to the rose field.\n2. Assign a weight of infinity to all other fields: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation, sunflower, orchid, peony, zinnia, tulip, hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, lavender, daisy.\n3. Set the current field as the rose field.\n4. Visit each connected field from the current field and update their weights if a shorter path is found:\n   - The lily field is connected to the rose field.

Select the unvisited field with the minimum weight as the new current field. In this case, it is the lily field.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all fields have been visited.\n\nContinuing the steps:\n\n4. Visit each connected field from the current field and update their weights if a shorter path is found:\n   - The chrysanthemum field is connected to the lily field. Update its weight to 2.\n   - The poppy field is connected to the lily field. Update its weight to 2.\n   - The daisy field is connected to the lily field. Update its weight to 2.\n   - The rose field has already been visited, so no update is necessary.\n8. Mark the lily field as visited.\n9. Select the unvisited field with the minimum weight as the new current field. In this case, it is the chrysanthemum field.\n\nContinuing the steps:\n\n4. Visit each connected field from the current field and update their weights if a shorter path is found:\n   - The poppy field is connected to the chrysanthemum field. Update its weight to 3.\n   - The lily field has already been visited, so no update is necessary.\n   - The daisy field has already been visited, so no update is necessary.\n   - The rose field has already been visited, so no update is necessary.\n10.
