The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we have the following connections: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n\n2. From the carnation field, we have a connection to the zinnia field, which offers a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free. Since this is the maximum number of flowers we can get for free, we should prioritize visiting the peony field.\n\n3. From the peony field, we have a connection to the zinnia field. However, since we can only take one bunch of flowers, we should not visit the zinnia field at this point.\n\n4. Backtracking to the carnation field, we can continue to the poppy field.\n\n5. From the poppy field, we have a connection to the lavender field, which offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free. Since this is the only opportunity to get lavender flowers, we should prioritize visiting the lavender field.\n\n6. From the lavender field, we have connections to the daisy field, lily field, and marigold field. However, since we can only take one bunch of flowers, we should not visit any of these fields at this point.\n\n7. Backtracking to the poppy field, we can continue to the chrysanthemum field.\n\n8. From the chrysanthemum field, we have a connection to the lily field. However, since we have already visited the lily field, we should not revisit it.\n\n9. From the chrysanthemum field, we have no more connections to unvisited fields.\n\nBased on this analysis, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nRose, Carnation, Poppy, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Poppy, Lavender"
