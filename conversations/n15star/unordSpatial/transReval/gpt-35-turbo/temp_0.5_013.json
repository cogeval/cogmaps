The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n3. To maximize the number of flowers, we need to choose a field that has the highest number of flowers available.\n4. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field, but the poppy field is also connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and daisy field. Therefore, we should avoid the chrysanthemum field and the poppy field.\n5. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field, but the chrysanthemum field is already excluded. Therefore, we should choose the lily field.\n6. The lily field is connected to the daisy field, which is connected to the lavender field. However, the lavender field only offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free, which is fewer than the 50 peony flowers available in the peony field. Therefore, we should avoid the lavender field.\n7. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. Since we have already excluded the chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field, we should choose the daisy field.\n8. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, which is already visited. Therefore, we have reached the end of the path.\n\nBased on the analysis, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Daisy"
