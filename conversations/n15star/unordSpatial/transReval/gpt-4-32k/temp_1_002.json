The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose Field\n2. Sunflower Field\n3. Orchid Field\n4. Peony Field\n\nShortest path to Lavender Field:\n1. Rose Field\n2. Daisy Field\n3. Lavender Field\n\nThe shortest path to the Peony Field has four steps, while the shortest path to the Lavender Field has three steps. However, we also need to consider the number of flowers gained in each path.\n\nAt the Peony Field, we can get 50 flowers, and at the Lavender Field, we can get 10 flowers.\n\nSince the objective is to maximize the number of flowers, we should choose the shortest path to the Peony Field, even though it has one more step.\n\nAnswer: Rose Field, Sunflower Field, Orchid Field, Peony Field"
