Starting at Starbucks, we can access Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, and Sephora.\n2. From Paris Baguette, we can access Marshalls, H&M, Zara, and Target.\n3. From H&M, we can access Zara and Marshalls, but we have already visited those stores in previous steps.\n4. From Zara, we can also access Marshalls and Target.\n5. From Sephora, we can access Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, and Bath and Body Works.\n\nNow, since we can teleport to any room only once, let's assume we use the magic coffee bean to teleport to a store that hasn't been visited yet.\n\n6. Teleport to Chickflea and visit Baskin and Robins, Levi's, and GNC Live Well.\n7. From Baskin and Robins, we can access Levi's and GNC Live Well, which have already been visited in step 6.\n8. From Levi's, we can access GNC Live Well and Target.\n9. From GNC Live Well, we can access Target.\n\nFollowing this path, we can visit 12 unique stores: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Sephora, Marshalls, Target, Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, Levi's, GNC Live Well, and Nike (from Sephora).\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Sephora, Marshalls, Target, Chickflea, Baskin and Robins, Levi's, GNC Live Well, Nike"
