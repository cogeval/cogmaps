Starbucks -> Sephora\n\nNext, let's explore the connections from each of these stores:\n\n1. Paris Baguette:\n   - H&M\n   - Zara\n   - Marshalls\n   - Target\n\n2. H&M:\n   - Zara\n   - Paris Baguette\n   - Marshalls\n   - Target\n\n3. Zara:\n   - H&M\n   - Paris Baguette\n   - Marshalls\n   - Target\n\n4. Sephora:\n   - Pete's Coffee\n   - Carter Children\n   - Nike\n   - Bath and Body Works\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that starting from Starbucks and going to either Paris Baguette, H&M, or Zara will lead to the same set of connected stores. Going to Sephora will lead to a different set of connected stores, but it has fewer connections. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward would be starting from Starbucks and going to Paris Baguette, H&M, or Zara.\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Marshalls, Target"
