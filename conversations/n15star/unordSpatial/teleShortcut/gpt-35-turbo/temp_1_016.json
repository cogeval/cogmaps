The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We'll start from the rose field and explore the connected fields, considering the number of flowers we can get for free. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n3. Calculate the number of flowers we can get for free in each neighboring field:\n   - Lily field: No free flowers.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: No free flowers.\n   - Poppy field: No free flowers.\n   - Carnation field: No free flowers.\n4. Choose the field with the maximum number of free flowers, which is none in this case.\n5. There are no more fields to visit since none of the neighboring fields have free flowers.\n6. The final outcome is \"Answer: Rose\".\n\nTherefore, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is just the rose field itself."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, considering the new teleportation portal from the aster field to any neighboring field of the zinnia field, we'll modify our approach. Here is the updated solution:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation, and aster fields.\n3. Calculate the number of flowers we can get for free in each neighboring field:\n   - Lily field: No free flowers.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: No free flowers.\n   - Poppy field: No free flowers.\n   - Carnation field: No free flowers.\n   - Aster field: No free flowers.\n4. Choose the field with the maximum number of free flowers, which is none in this case.\n5. Since we have the teleportation portal from the aster field to any neighboring field of the zinnia field, we can consider the neighboring fields of the zinnia field.\n6. Check the neighboring fields connected to the zinnia field: peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n7. Calculate the number of flowers we can get for free in each neighboring field:\n   - Peony field: 50 free peony flowers.\n   - Carnation field: No free flowers.\n   - Zinnia field: No free flowers.\n8. Choose the field with the maximum number of free flowers, which is the peony field.\n9. Since we have the maximum number of free flowers in the peony field, we'll choose to visit the peony field.\n10. There are no more fields to visit since the peony field doesn't have any connections.\n11. The final outcome is \"Answer: Rose, Peony\".\n\nTherefore, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Peony."
