The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Each flower field can be considered as a node, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nLet's create a graph based on the given information:\n\nRose -> Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\nSunflower -> Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\nTulip -> Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\nDaisy -> Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\nOrchid -> Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\nHydrangea -> Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\nLily -> Chrysanthemum, Poppy\nPeony -> Zinnia\nDaffodil -> Marigold, Lavender\nChrysanthemum -> Poppy\nCarnation -> Zinnia\nMarigold -> Lavender\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the rose field, we will explore all the connected fields one by one until we reach the target field (peony field). Along the way, we will keep track of the maximum number of flowers we can obtain.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Explore the connected fields (lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation).\n3. Check if any of these fields are the target field (peony). If yes, stop the search.\n4. If the target field is not found, add the connected fields to the queue and move to the next level.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target field is found or all the fields have been explored.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the rose field to the peony field is:\n\nRose -> Lily -> Chrysanthemum -> Poppy -> Peony\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Peony"
