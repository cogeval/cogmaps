The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

The shortest path that includes the peony field is: rose field -> lily field -> chrysanthemum field -> peony field. This path allows to get a free bunch of 50 peony flowers. The shortest path that includes the lavender field is: rose field -> daisy field -> lavender field. This path allows to get a free bunch of 10 lavender flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is \"rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, peony field\" and it will give a free bunch of 50 peony flowers. \n\nAnswer: Rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, peony field."

This means that from the poppy field you can go to any field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers?

The algorithm will calculate the shortest paths from the rose field to all the other fields and we can choose the path that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from the rose field to the peony field is: rose field -> lily field -> chrysanthemum field -> peony field, and the distance is 4 fields. The shortest path from the rose field to the lavender field is: rose field -> daisy field -> lavender field, and the distance is also 4 fields. \n\nSince both paths have the same distance and the peony field offers a greater number of flowers (50 vs 10), the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field is: \"rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, peony field\".\n\nAnswer: Rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, peony field."
