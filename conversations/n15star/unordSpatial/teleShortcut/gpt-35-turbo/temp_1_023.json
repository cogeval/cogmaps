The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

Let's first represent the flower fields and their connections as a graph:\n\n- Rose Field: Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Carnation Field\n- Lily Field: Rose Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Daisy Field\n- Chrysanthemum Field: Rose Field, Lily Field, Poppy Field, Daisy Field, Lily Field\n- Poppy Field: Rose Field, Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Daisy Field, Carnation Field, Chrysanthemum Field\n- Carnation Field: Rose Field, Poppy Field, Orchid Field, Zinnia Field\n- Orchid Field: Carnation Field, Peony Field, Zinnia Field\n- Zinnia Field: Carnation Field, Orchid Field, Peony Field, Marigold Field\n- Peony Field: Zinnia Field, Orchid Field, Carnation Field, Tulip Field\n- Tulip Field: Peony Field, Hydrangea Field, Daffodil Field, Marigold Field\n- Hydrangea Field: Tulip Field, Daffodil Field, Marigold Field, Lavender Field\n- Daffodil Field: Hydrangea Field, Tulip Field, Marigold Field, Lavender Field\n- Marigold Field: Daffodil Field, Hydrangea Field, Tulip Field, Zinnia Field\n- Lavender Field: Hydrangea Field, Daffodil Field, Marigold Field, Daisy Field\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path starting from the rose field. We will use Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which has a distance of 0. Also, initialize the number of flowers collected at each field as 0.\n2. Set the current field as the rose field and mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighbor of the current field, calculate the total distance from the start (which is the sum of the distances of the current field and the edge weight) and update the number of flowers collected at the neighbor field.\n4. Select the unvisited field with the smallest total distance as the next current field and mark it as visited. If there are multiple fields with the same total distance, prioritize the field with the maximum number of flowers collected.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all fields are visited or there are no more reachable fields.\n6. The resulting path will be the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1.
