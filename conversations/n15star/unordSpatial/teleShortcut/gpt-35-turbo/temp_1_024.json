The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n3. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n4. The poppy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and lavender field.\n5. The lavender field is connected to the marigold field.\n6. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n7. The peony field is connected to the orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n8. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n9. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n10. The zinnia field is connected to the peony field.\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the number of flowers we can get for free from the peony field and the lavender field.\n\nSince we can get 50 peony flowers for free from the peony field, and the peony field is connected to the rose field through the carnation field, we will choose to visit the peony field first.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Carnation, Peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Peony"

The additional information is that from the aster field, we can teleport to any neighboring field of the zinnia field.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, we should still visit the peony field first to get 50 free peony flowers.\n\nAfter visiting the peony field, we can teleport from the aster field to the neighboring field of the zinnia field. Since the zinnia field is the only neighboring field of the aster field, we will teleport directly to the zinnia field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the teleportation portal, is: Rose, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia."
