The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Among these options, the chrysanthemum field offers the highest number of flowers, which is not mentioned. Therefore, we will choose the chrysanthemum field.\n\nFrom the chrysanthemum field, we can see that it is connected to the poppy field. However, the poppy field does not offer any additional flowers. Therefore, we will not choose the poppy field.\n\nNext, we need to determine the shortest path to the peony field, which offers a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free. From the chrysanthemum field, we can see that it is connected to the peony field. Therefore, we will choose the peony field.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the shortest path to the lavender field, which offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free. From the peony field, we can see that it is not directly connected to the lavender field. However, the peony field is connected to the zinnia field, and the zinnia field is connected to the carnation field, which is connected to the lavender field. Therefore, the shortest path from the peony field to the lavender field is through the zinnia field, carnation field, and lavender field.\n\nBased on this analysis, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, chrysanthemum, peony, zinnia, carnation, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Peony, Zinnia, Carnation, Lavender"

From the chrysanthemum field, we can see that it is connected to the peony field. Therefore, we will choose the peony field.\n\nNow, we need to consider the teleportation portal in the aster field. Since the zinnia field is the neighboring field of the aster field, we can teleport directly to the zinnia field.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the shortest path to the lavender field, which offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free. From the zinnia field, we can see that it is connected to the carnation field, which is connected to the lavender field. Therefore, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the lavender field is through the carnation field.\n\nBased on this analysis, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the teleportation portal, is: rose, chrysanthemum, peony, aster, zinnia, carnation, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Peony, Aster, Zinnia, Carnation, Lavender"
