The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a graph representing the connections between the flower fields:\n   - Create a node for each flower field.\n   - Add edges between connected fields, with weights representing the number of flowers obtained by visiting the connected field.\n\n2. Initialize the algorithm:\n   - Set the distance of the starting node (rose field) to 0, and the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\n   - Set the starting node as the current node.\n\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\n   - Visit the neighbors of the current node.\n   - Update the distances to the neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n   - Mark the current node as visited.\n\n4.
