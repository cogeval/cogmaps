The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's go step by step:\n\n1. The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Since we want to maximize the number of flowers, we need to choose the field that offers the most flowers. From the available options, the carnation field offers a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free.\n3. From the carnation field, we need to determine the next optimal field to visit. Looking at the connections, the carnation field is connected to the zinnia field, which offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n4. The zinnia field does not have any further connections, so this will be the last field we visit.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, carnation, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Zinnia."

The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field, which offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n4. However, now we have a new option. We can use the teleportation portal in the aster field to visit any neighboring field of the zinnia field. Looking at the connections, the aster field is directly connected to the zinnia field.\n5. The zinnia field does not have any further connections, so this will be the last field we visit.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the teleportation option, is: rose, carnation, aster, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Aster, Zinnia."
