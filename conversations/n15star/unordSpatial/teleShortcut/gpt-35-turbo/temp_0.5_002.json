The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

However, none of these fields offer free flowers.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, we need to consider the available options. The peony field offers a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free, and the lavender field offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n\nSince the peony field is not directly connected to the rose field, we need to find the shortest path to reach it. Let's analyze the connections:\n\n1. Rose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Lavender field: This path includes the lavender field, but we can only get 10 lavender flowers for free. Therefore, this path is not the most optimal.\n\n2. Rose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Carnation field -> Zinnia field -> Peony field: This path includes the peony field, and we can get 50 peony flowers for free. This is the most optimal path.\n\nSo, starting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field, Peony field.\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field, Peony field."

Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose field -> Asters field -> Zinnia field: This path allows us to teleport directly to the Zinnia field, where we can obtain a bunch of flowers. However, it is not specified which type of flowers are available in the Zinnia field.\n\n2. Rose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Carnation field -> Zinnia field: This path includes the Zinnia field, and we can potentially obtain flowers from there.\n\nSince the information about the flowers available in the Zinnia field is not provided, we cannot determine the maximum number of flowers we can obtain from that field. Therefore, the most optimal path is the one that includes the maximum number of known flowers.\n\nStarting from the rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field.\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Zinnia field."
