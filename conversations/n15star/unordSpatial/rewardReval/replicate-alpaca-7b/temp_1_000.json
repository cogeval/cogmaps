The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field and taking one bunch of 50 flowers, one can explore the rose field, lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field and carnation field obtainring maximum of 7 flowers. Taking more bunches means the exploration could overlap in different order that does not explore any new flower fields and therefore reduces the number of flowers retrieved. Starting from another flower field, any other path, could yield other maximum flower count, notably for those connected to other fields as the zinnia is only reachdble by exploring the rose and lavender fields, in a total of only five floras. Other than visit the same field more times, no combinations exist for laveter 50 flowers as only bouquet of max 10 lavender flowers is avaliable from lavanda field. Similarly, zinin field only holds a maximum bouquet size of 10 zinnia. There is no such combinations like start from the rose field, zinine field; get 10 of 5o flowers, followed of other max bouqets of 20 (rose and lily, lily and chrysanth, and chrysant and popp ) or one explration to maximise overall bouquet, will yield same result as what has being stated above. All other path from Rose field will exceed both time required. The bouquet of 50 plus free of flowers. One can explore around, to see which paths gives more of desired flor, either starting of existing flowers, all for a desired quantity not found with current constraints and other available flower boucets.. Please list flower names in the path above and do comaprare the results against max flower amount possible while exploring only a prefence amount of flower field and visit only once per flower - ( rose:lily ch,rys:po. car:Z. and visa vr.). Start with a small path, gradually extend. Examples below:  rose; lily,chrysanthemum; poppl ;carotion :visa vr. Or another example: rose; lily,chrys:pot ;  visapre ovi. Or any other comon starting points/direction exploration available and only follow until full desieased bouques available, with no repeat flor.  Start witha small path, gradually extend and record above results."
