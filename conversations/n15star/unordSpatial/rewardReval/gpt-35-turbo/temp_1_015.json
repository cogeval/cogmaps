The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We need to analyze the flower fields connected to each of these fields to determine the path with the highest number of flowers.\n\nThe lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field. The poppy field is also connected to the carnation field.\n\nConsidering the given information about the number of free flowers we can get, it is clear that we should prioritize visiting the peony field first to get the bunch of 50 peony flowers for free.\n\nThe peony field is connected to the orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. So, our next step is to visit the peony field, followed by the zinnia field.\n\nThe zinnia field is connected to the sunflower field. However, since we have already obtained the maximum number of flowers from the peony field, visiting the sunflower field is not necessary.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia"

However, since we have already obtained the maximum number of flowers from the peony field, visiting the sunflower field is not necessary.\n\nFinally, we consider the lavender field. Given that the bunch from the lavender field contains 48 flowers, it offers a higher number of flowers compared to the revised bunch from the peony field (12 flowers). Therefore, it is more beneficial to visit the lavender field last to obtain the bunch of 48 lavender flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, considering the updated numbers of flowers, is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation, Peony, Zinnia, Lavender"
