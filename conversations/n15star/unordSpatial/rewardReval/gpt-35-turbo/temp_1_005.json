The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following connections:\n   - Rose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Lavender field\n\n2. Since we can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field, we need to determine which field will yield the maximum number of flowers:\n   - Lily field is connected to the Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Lavender field.\n   - Chrysanthemum field is connected to the Poppy field.\n   - Poppy field is connected to the Lavender field.\n\n3. Among these options, the Poppy field is the field that will yield the maximum number of flowers because it is connected to the most fields.\n\n4. So, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n   Answer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy"

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following connections:\n   - Rose field -> Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field -> Lavender field\n\n2. Among the connected fields, let's consider the number of flowers in each field:\n   - Lily field: No free flowers mentioned.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: No free flowers mentioned.\n   - Poppy field: No free flowers mentioned.\n   - Lavender field: Free bunch of 48 lavender flowers.\n\n3. Based on the updated numbers, the Lavender field now yields the maximum number of flowers for free.\n\n4.
