The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Each flower field will be a node, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges. \n\nFirst, I will create a graph with the given connections:\n\n- Rose field is connected to Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Carnation field.\n- Lily field is connected to Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field.\n- Chrysanthemum field is connected to Poppy field.\n- Poppy field is connected to Carnation field.\n\nNow, I will use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from the Rose field to any field that allows me to obtain the maximum number of flowers. During the search, I will keep track of the number of flowers I can obtain from each field.\n\nStarting from the Rose field, I will traverse the graph in the following order:\n\n1. Rose field\n2. Lily field\n3. Chrysanthemum field\n4. Poppy field\n5. Carnation field\n\nSince the Rose field is the starting point, it does not yield any flowers. However, from the Poppy field, I can obtain a bunch of 50 Peony flowers for free. Therefore, the shortest path from the Rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy"

Rose field\n2. Lily field\n3. Chrysanthemum field\n4. Poppy field\n5. Carnation field\n\nSince the Rose field is the starting point and does not yield any flowers, I will move on to the next field, which is the Lily field. Similarly, the Lily field does not yield any flowers, so I will continue to the Chrysanthemum field. Again, the Chrysanthemum field does not yield any flowers.\n\nNext, I will move to the Poppy field. From the Poppy field, I can obtain a bunch of 12 Peony flowers. However, since the Lavender field now offers 48 flowers, which is more than the Peony field, I will continue to the next field.\n\nThe last field is the Carnation field, which also does not yield any flowers. Therefore, the shortest path from the Rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender"
