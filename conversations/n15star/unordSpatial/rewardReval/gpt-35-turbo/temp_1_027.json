The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each field. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the fields to explore. Enqueue the rose field with the number of peony flowers as 0.\n\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n\n3. Initialize variables to store the maximum number of peony flowers and the corresponding path.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - Mark the field as visited.\n   - If the field is the peony field and the number of peony flowers obtained is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum number of peony flowers and the corresponding path.\n   - Explore the neighboring fields that are connected to the current field.\n   - For each neighboring field:\n     - If the field has not been visited:\n       - Calculate the number of flowers obtained by visiting the neighboring field.\n       - Enqueue the neighboring field with the updated number of flowers.\n       - Update the path to include the neighboring field.\n\n5.
