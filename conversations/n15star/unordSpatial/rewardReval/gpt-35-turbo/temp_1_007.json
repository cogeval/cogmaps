The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we will first check the neighboring fields: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields. \n2. Since we want the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the fields that have the most connections. Both the poppy and carnation fields are connected to multiple other fields, so we will prioritize these two fields. \n3. Next, we check the neighboring fields of the poppy and carnation fields. The poppy field is connected to the daisy and lavender fields, while the carnation field is connected to the orchid and zinnia fields. \n4. Continuing our search, we check the neighboring fields of the daisy, lavender, orchid, and zinnia fields. The daisy field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, and poppy fields (which we have already visited), so we can exclude it from our path. The lavender field is connected to the daisy, marigold, and rose fields. The orchid field is connected to the peony, carnation, and zinnia fields. The zinnia field is connected to the sunflower, peony, and carnation fields. \n5. Based on our analysis, the path with the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n   - Rose Field -> Carnation Field -> Orchid Field -> Peony Field\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Carnation, Orchid, Peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation, Orchid, Peony"
