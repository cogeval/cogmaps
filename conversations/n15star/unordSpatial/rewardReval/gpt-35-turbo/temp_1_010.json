The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections as edges.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge, indicating the cost of moving from one field to another.\n3. Initialize the distance to each field as infinity, except for the rose field which will be 0.\n4. Initialize an empty set to store the visited fields.\n5. While there are unvisited fields:\n   a. Choose the field with the minimum distance and mark it as visited.\n   b. Update the distances of the neighboring fields if a shorter path is found.\n6. Determine the shortest path from the rose field to each field by following the minimum distance values.\n7. Calculate the number of flowers obtained for each path and choose the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n8. List the flower names in order, starting from the rose field and following the chosen path.\n\nNow let's go step by step through Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Create the graph:\n\n   - Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n   - Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n   - Poppy field: (No connections)\n   - Carnation field: Zinnia field\n   - Zinnia field: (No connections)\n\n2. Assign weights:\n\n   - All edges have a weight of 1.\n\n3. Initialize distances:\n\n   - Rose field: 0\n   - Lily field: Infinity\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Infinity\n   - Poppy field: Infinity\n   - Carnation field: Infinity\n   - Zinnia field: Infinity\n\n4. Initialize visited set:\n\n   - Empty set\n\n5. While there are unvisited fields:\n\n   a. Choose the field with the minimum distance and mark it as visited:\n\n      - Start with the rose field since its distance is 0.\n\n   b. Update distances:\n\n      - From the rose field, the minimum distance is 0. Update the neighboring fields:\n\n         - Lily field: 1\n         - Chrysanthemum field: 1\n         - Poppy field: 1\n         - Carnation field: 1\n\n   c. Mark the current field as visited and remove it from the unvisited set:\n\n      - Mark the rose field as visited.\n\n   d. Repeat steps a-c until all fields are visited.\n\n6. Determine the shortest path:\n\n   - The shortest path is from the rose field to the lily field, followed by the chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n\n7. Calculate the number of flowers obtained:\n\n   - The rose field does not offer any free flowers.\n   - The lily field does not offer any free flowers.\n   - The chrysanthemum field does not offer any free flowers.\n   - The poppy field does not offer any free flowers.\n   - The carnation field does not offer any free flowers.\n\n8.
