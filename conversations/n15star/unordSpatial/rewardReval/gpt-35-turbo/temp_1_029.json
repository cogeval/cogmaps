The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to determine the path:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Create an empty queue and add the rose field to the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained from each field.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to store the path taken to reach each field.\n6. Set the number of flowers obtained from the rose field as 0.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the field from the front of the queue.\n   b. Add the field to the visited set.\n   c. If the field is the peony field, stop the search and retrieve the path taken to reach the peony field from the dictionary.\n   d. Otherwise, check each neighboring field:\n      - If the neighboring field is not in the visited set:\n         - Calculate the number of flowers obtained if choosing to visit this field (considering the bonuses).\n         - If the number of flowers obtained from this field is greater than the previous recorded number of flowers (or the field is not yet recorded), update the number of flowers obtained in the dictionary.\n         - Add the neighboring field to the queue.\n         - Add the path taken to reach the neighboring field to the dictionary.\n8.
