Please be more specific.\n\nThe path should be from rose, carnation, orchid, marigold, flower field, orchid, carnation, chrysanthemum field, rose. I got this path because carnation and orchid share the road to chrysanthemum field and rose field. And lavander flower field and peony field shares the road with orchid field, so lavander flowers and rose flowers have more paths to select from. But I failed to realize that carnation also shares the road with peony field. There are only 2 ways to reach carnation from lavander field: 1. through rose field, which gave 20 carnations, then, using the new rules, 2. by bringing 70 carnations from carnation field, then dropping 40 at rose field, then taking another 30 back to carnation field, leaving 20 to lavander field and thus 20 flowers in lavander field would give 25 lavander flowers. 2. bringing 30 carnations from carnation field, passing by rose field, passing by peony field, passing by lavander field, leaving 30 at lavander field, then using the new rules, dropping 30 at carnation field.\n\nFollowing this logic, it is possible to do the following path:\n\nrose - carnation - lavander - carnation - orchid - carnation - chrysanthemum field - rose.\n\nI am looking for a logic that answers my question and not a code.\n\nComment: This challenge is actually about programming.
