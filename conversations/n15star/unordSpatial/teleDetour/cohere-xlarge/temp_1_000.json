The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Therefore, I did not choose the rose field at first. I chose the tulip field first. Because if I had chosen the tulip field last, I would not have been able to get the most flowers. Then I thought I should choose the sunflower field next because it has a lot of fields. Finally, I chose the rose field. This is because the sunflower field has only one flower field, and if I chose it last, I would not have been able to get more flowers. Therefore, I chose the rose field.\n\nSo the output will be like this:\nYou should visit the tulip field, sunflower field, and rose field in that order. You can take a bunch of 50 tulips from tulip field, 10 sunflowers from sunflower field, and 10 roses from rose field.\n\nFor the above task, you should first get the index of each flower field from the data. Then, for each field, get the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nI got the answer by thinking step by step. First, I was sure"
