Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara -> Sephora (Path closed for cleaning)\n2. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> Marshalls -> H&M -> Zara -> Sephora (Path closed for cleaning)\n\nSince the direct path between Starbucks and Sephora is closed for cleaning, we need to use the magic coffee bean to teleport to another store and then find a path to Sephora.\n\nPossible teleport options from Starbucks:\n\n1. Teleport to Pete's Coffee\n2. Teleport to Chickflea\n3. Teleport to Marshalls\n4. Teleport to Carter Children\n5. Teleport to Baskins and Robins\n6. Teleport to Levis\n7.
