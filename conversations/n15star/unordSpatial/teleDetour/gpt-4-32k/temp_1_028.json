Pete\u2019s Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works are connected to each other. Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Nike are all connected to each other. Marshalls, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, and Target are connected to each other. Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works are connected to each other. Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Target are connected to each other. Paris Baguette, H&M, and Zara are connected to each other. Nike is connected to Bath and Body Works. Levis, GNC Live Well and Target are connected to each other. H&M is connected to Zara. Sephora is connected to Bath and Body Works. GNC Live Well is connected to Target. You are in Starbucks and you find a magic coffee bean with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that the path between Starbucks and Sephora is now closed for cleaning. From Starbucks, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the store names in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "First, let's identify the possible paths from Starbucks to Sephora without using the magic coffee bean. Since the direct path between Starbucks and Sephora is closed, we can consider the following paths:\n\n1. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara -> Marshalls -> Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Nike -> Bath and Body Works -> Sephora\n2. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara -> Marshalls -> Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Nike -> Carter Children -> Sephora\n3. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara -> Marshalls -> Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Nike -> Pete's Coffee -> Sephora\n\nNow, let's use the magic coffee bean to teleport directly to one store and shorten the path:\n\n1. Teleport to Paris Baguette: Starbucks -> Paris Baguette (teleport) -> H&M -> Zara -> Marshalls -> Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Nike -> Bath and Body Works -> Sephora\n2. Teleport to Nike: Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara -> Marshalls -> Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Baskin and Robins -> Chickflea -> Nike (teleport) -> Bath and Body Works -> Sephora\n\nThe second path is the shortest and yields the most reward. So the path is:\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Marshalls, Target, GNC Live Well, Levis, Baskin and Robins, Chickflea, Nike, Bath and Body Works, Sephora"
