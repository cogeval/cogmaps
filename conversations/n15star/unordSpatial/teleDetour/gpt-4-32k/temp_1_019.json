The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

I will find the shortest path for each and compare the lengths.\n\nPeony field path:\n1. Start at the rose field\n2. Go to the sunflower field\n3. Go to the orchid field\n4. Go to the peony field\n\nLavender field path:\n1. Start at the rose field\n2. Go to the daisy field\n3. Go to the lavender field\n\nThe shortest path to the lavender field is shorter than the shortest path to the peony field. However, I can only take one bunch of flowers, and the bunch from the peony field has 50 flowers compared to 10 from the lavender field. So, I will choose the path with the most flowers, which leads to the peony field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Orchid, Peony"

Start at the rose field\n2. Go to the daisy field\n3. Teleport from the daisy field to the peony field\n\nLavender field path:\n1. Start at the rose field\n2. Go to the daisy field\n3. Teleport from the daisy field to the lavender field\n\nBoth paths now have the same length due to the teleportation portal. Since the peony field offers a bunch of 50 flowers compared to the 10 from the lavender field, the path to the peony field yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Peony"
