You are in Starbucks and you find a magic coffee bean with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that the path between Starbucks and Sephora is now closed for cleaning. From Starbucks, what is the path that yields the most reward?

Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> Marshalls -> Target\n3. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Carter Children -> Nike\n4. Starbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Carter Children -> Bath & Body Works\n\nSince we cannot directly reach Sephora from Starbucks, we will use the magic coffee bean to teleport from one of these connected stores to Sephora.\n\nNow, let's analyze the paths to Sephora from the above store list:\n\n1. Zara -> Sephora\n2. Target -> GNC Live Well -> Levis -> Nike -> Sephora\n3. Nike -> Sephora\n4. Bath & Body Works -> Sephora\n\nConsidering the paths that yield the most reward (visiting the most number of stores), we can choose the path:\n\nStarbucks -> Paris Baguette -> H&M -> Zara (use magic coffee bean) -> Sephora\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Sephora"
