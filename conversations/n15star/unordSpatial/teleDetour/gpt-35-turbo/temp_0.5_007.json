The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We also know that the peony field is connected to the orchid field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, we need to choose the path that allows us to collect the most flowers. Let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Rose Field -> Lily Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Poppy Field -> Lavender Field\n   This path allows us to collect a bunch of roses from the rose field, a bunch of lilies from the lily field, a bunch of chrysanthemums from the chrysanthemum field, and a bunch of poppies from the poppy field. However, it does not allow us to collect any lavender flowers.\n\n2. Rose Field -> Lily Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Poppy Field -> Carnation Field -> Zinnia Field -> Peony Field\n   This path allows us to collect a bunch of roses from the rose field, a bunch of lilies from the lily field, a bunch of chrysanthemums from the chrysanthemum field, a bunch of poppies from the poppy field, a bunch of carnations from the carnation field, a bunch of zinnias from the zinnia field, and a bunch of peonies from the peony field. This path allows us to collect the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\nRose Field, Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Carnation Field, Zinnia Field, Peony Field.\n\nAnswer: Rose Field, Lily Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Poppy Field, Carnation Field, Zinnia Field, Peony Field."
