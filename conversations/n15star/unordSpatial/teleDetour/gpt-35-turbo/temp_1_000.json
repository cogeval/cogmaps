Since we can only teleport once, we want to make the most out of it by visiting the maximum number of stores that are not connected to each other. \n\nStarting at Starbucks, we can teleport to Marshalls, which is not directly connected to any of the stores that Starbucks is connected to. From there, we can visit Target, which is connected to Levis, GNC Live Well, and Baskin and Robins, which are not directly connected to any of the stores that Starbucks is connected to. Finally, we can visit Chickflea, which is connected to Baskin and Robins, Levis, and GNC Live Well, which are also not directly connected to any of the stores that Starbucks is connected to. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is: Starbucks, Marshalls, Target, Baskin and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Chickflea.\n\nAnswer: Starbucks, Marshalls, Target, Baskin and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, Chickflea."
