The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will explore each possible path and determine the number of flowers we can collect.\n\n1. Rose field -> Lily field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n2. Rose field -> Chrysanthemum field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n3. Rose field -> Poppy field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n4. Rose field -> Carnation field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\nBased on the given connections, there are no opportunities to collect free flowers starting from the rose field. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is the path that only includes the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"

Rose field -> Daisy field (using the teleportation portal):\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n2. Daisy field -> Lily field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n3. Daisy field -> Chrysanthemum field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n4. Daisy field -> Poppy field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\n5. Daisy field -> Carnation field:\n   - No free flowers available.\n\nSince there are no opportunities to collect free flowers along the path, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is to stay in the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"
