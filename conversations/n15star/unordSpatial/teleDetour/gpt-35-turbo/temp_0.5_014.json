The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the lily field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field and the poppy field. However, the chrysanthemum field is a dead-end and does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we choose to go to the poppy field.\n\n3. From the poppy field, we can go to the carnation field. However, the carnation field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we choose to stay in the poppy field.\n\n4. Since the poppy field does not have any further connections, this is the end of our path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, poppy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy"

Let's analyze the connections and flower yields:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following connections: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n\n2. From the rose field, we can teleport to the daisy field and have access to all other fields. Let's consider each field one by one:\n\n   a. If we go to the lily field, we can then go to the chrysanthemum field and the poppy field. However, neither of these fields yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n   \n   b. If we go to the chrysanthemum field, we can then go to the poppy field. However, the poppy field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n   \n   c. If we go to the poppy field, we can then go to the carnation field. However, the carnation field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n   \n   d. If we go to the carnation field, we cannot proceed further as it is a dead-end. Therefore, we skip this path.\n\n3. Since none of the paths from the daisy field yield any additional flowers, we need to consider other options.\n\n4. If we stay in the rose field, we can directly go to the lily field. From the lily field, we can then go to the chrysanthemum field, which does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n\n5. If we stay in the rose field, we can directly go to the chrysanthemum field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can then go to the poppy field. However, the poppy field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n\n6. If we stay in the rose field, we can directly go to the poppy field. From the poppy field, we can then go to the carnation field. However, the carnation field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n\n7. If we stay in the rose field, we can directly go to the carnation field. However, the carnation field does not yield any additional flowers. Therefore, we skip this path.\n\nConsidering all possible paths, we find that there are no paths from the rose field that yield any additional flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is simply staying in the rose field.\n\nAnswer: Rose"
