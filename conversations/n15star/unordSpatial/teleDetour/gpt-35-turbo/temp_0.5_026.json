The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We need to find the path that includes the fields with the most flowers.\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following options:\n   - Lily field: Connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Connected to the poppy field.\n   - Poppy field: Connected to the lily field and chrysanthemum field.\n   - Carnation field: Not connected to any other field.\n\n2. Let's analyze the number of flowers we can get from each field:\n   - Lily field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Poppy field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Carnation field: No information about free flowers.\n\nSince there is no information about free flowers in any of the fields, we need to choose the path that maximizes the number of flowers we can collect. In this case, we can choose any of the connected fields from the rose field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field can be:\nRose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation"

Let's analyze the connections and determine the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field.\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following options:\n   - Lily field: Connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Connected to the poppy field.\n   - Poppy field: Connected to the lily field and chrysanthemum field.\n   - Carnation field: Not directly connected.\n\n2. Since we have a teleportation portal in the daisy field, we can use it to reach any field. Let's analyze the number of flowers we can get from each field:\n   - Daisy field: Connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. Offers no free flowers.\n   - Lily field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Chrysanthemum field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Poppy field: No information about free flowers.\n   - Lavender field: Offers a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n\n3. Considering the options, we can see that the lavender field offers a bunch of 10 free flowers. Therefore, it is beneficial to include the lavender field in our path.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, considering the teleportation portal in the daisy field, can be:\nRose, Daisy, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Lavender"
