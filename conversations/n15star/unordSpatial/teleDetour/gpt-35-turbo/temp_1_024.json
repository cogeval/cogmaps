The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we can choose to visit the following fields: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation.\n2. From the lily field, we have the following options: chrysanthemum and poppy.\n3. From the chrysanthemum field, the only option is the poppy field.\n4. From the poppy field, we can choose to visit the lavender field or the daisy field.\n5. If we choose the lavender field, we can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n6. If we choose the daisy field, we have the following options: lily, chrysanthemum, and poppy.\n7. From the lily field, we have already visited it before, so we need to backtrack.\n8. From the chrysanthemum field, we have already visited it before, so we need to backtrack.\n9. From the poppy field, we have already visited it before, so we need to backtrack.\n10. Since we can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free, the optimal path is to choose the poppy field and then the lavender field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is: rose, poppy, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Lavender"

Let's revise the steps to find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following options: lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation.\n2. From the lily field, we can choose to visit the chrysanthemum field or the poppy field.\n3. From the chrysanthemum field, the only option is the poppy field.\n4. From the poppy field, we can choose to visit the lavender field or the daisy field (with the teleportation portal).\n5. If we choose the lavender field, we can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n6. If we choose the daisy field (using the teleportation portal), we can then choose any field to visit.\n7. Let's consider visiting the peony field from the daisy field.\n8. From the peony field, we have the option to visit the zinnia field.\n9. From the zinnia field, we have no more options, so the path ends here.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, considering the teleportation portal, is: rose, poppy, daisy, peony, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Daisy, Peony, Zinnia"
