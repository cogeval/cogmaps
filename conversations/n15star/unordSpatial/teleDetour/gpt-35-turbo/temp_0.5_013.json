The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We also know that the peony field yields a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free, and the lavender field yields a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n\nLet's analyze the connections and determine the path that maximizes the number of flowers:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Since the peony field yields 50 peony flowers for free, we should prioritize visiting this field.\n3. From the rose field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field.\n4. From the chrysanthemum field, we can go to the poppy field.\n5. From the poppy field, we can go to the lavender field.\n6. Since the lavender field yields 10 lavender flowers for free, we should prioritize visiting this field.\n7. From the lavender field, we can go to the marigold field.\n8. From the marigold field, we can go to the hydrangea field.\n9. From the hydrangea field, we can go to the daffodil field.\n10. From the daffodil field, we can go to the peony field.\n11. Since we have already visited the peony field, we can end our path here.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Marigold, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Peony.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender, Marigold, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Peony."

Since the lavender field yields 10 lavender flowers for free, we should prioritize visiting this field.\n7. From the lavender field, we can go to the daisy field.\n8. From the daisy field, we can use the teleportation portal to go to any field.\n9. Since we have already visited the peony field, we should choose a different field to maximize the number of flowers.\n10. From the daisy field, we can teleport to the orchid field.\n11. From the orchid field, we can go to the zinnia field.\n12. Since the zinnia field yields a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free, we should prioritize visiting this field.\n13.
