The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the rose field, we have connections to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields. None of these fields provide any free flowers, so we'll skip them for now.\n\n2. From the poppy field, we have connections to the daisy, lily, chrysanthemum, and lavender fields. Again, none of these fields provide any free flowers.\n\n3. From the daisy field, we have connections to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and lavender fields. None of these fields provide any free flowers.\n\n4. From the lavender field, we have connections to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and daisy fields. The lavender field does provide 10 free lavender flowers, so we'll choose this field and collect the lavender flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, lavender."

From the rose field, we have connections to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields. None of these fields provide any free flowers, so we'll skip them for now.\n\n2. From the poppy field, we have connections to the daisy, lily, chrysanthemum, and lavender fields. None of these fields provide any free flowers.\n\n3. From the daisy field, we can teleport to any field, so we have the option to visit any field that offers free flowers. Let's consider the available options:\n\n   a. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum and poppy fields but doesn't offer any free flowers.\n   \n   b. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field but doesn't offer any free flowers.\n   \n   c. The lavender field is connected to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and daisy fields. The lavender field offers 10 free lavender flowers.\n   \n   d. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil, marigold, and lavender fields but doesn't offer any free flowers.\n   \n   e. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold and lavender fields but doesn't offer any free flowers.\n   \n   f. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field but doesn't offer any free flowers.\n   \n   g. The zinnia field is not directly connected to the daisy field.\n   \n   Therefore, the lavender field is the best choice from the daisy field for obtaining free flowers.\n\n4. From the lavender field, we have connections to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and daisy fields. We have already chosen the lavender field, which provides 10 free lavender flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, daisy (teleport), lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, daisy, lavender."
