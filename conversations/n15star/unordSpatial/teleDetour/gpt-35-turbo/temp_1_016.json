The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we will keep track of the shortest distance to each field and the previous field that leads to it. We will also keep track of the number of flowers we can obtain from each field.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the distance and previous field for each field as follows:\n   - Set the distance of the rose field to 0.\n   - Set the distance of all other fields to infinity.\n   - Set the previous field of all fields to null.\n\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields and their distances. Add the rose field to the priority queue with a distance of 0.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Remove the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue. Let's call it the current field.\n   - For each neighboring field connected to the current field, do the following:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current field to the neighboring field.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the recorded distance of the neighboring field, update its distance and previous field.\n     - Add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n\n4. After the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest distance and the previous field for each field.\n\n5. To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we will trace back from the lavender field to the rose field using the recorded previous field.\n   - Start from the lavender field.\n   - While the previous field is not null, do the following:\n     - Add the current field to the path.\n     - Update the current field to the previous field.\n   - Add the rose field to the path.\n\n6. Finally, we will reverse the path obtained in step 5 to get the shortest path from the rose field to the lavender field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender"
