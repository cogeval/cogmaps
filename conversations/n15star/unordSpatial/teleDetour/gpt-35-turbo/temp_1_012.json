The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we can choose either the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, or carnation field. Let's consider each option:\n   - Choosing the lily field leads to the daisy field, which is connected to the lavender field. However, we can't get any flowers from the lavender field. So, we don't choose this path.\n   - Choosing the chrysanthemum field leads to the lily field, which is connected to the daisy field, and finally the lavender field. Again, we can't get any flowers from the lavender field. So, we don't choose this path.\n   - Choosing the poppy field leads to the daisy field, which is connected to the lavender field. We can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if we choose to visit the lavender field. This path gives us a total of 10 flowers.\n   - Choosing the carnation field leads to the zinnia field, which is connected to the peony field. We can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if we visit the peony field. This path gives us a total of 50 flowers.\n\n2. Comparing the number of flowers obtained in each path, we see that choosing the carnation field yields the maximum number of flowers. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Carnation"
