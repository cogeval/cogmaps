The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free if you visit peony field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field, but neither of these fields offers a free bunch of flowers.\n\n3. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field, but neither of these fields offers a free bunch of flowers.\n\n4. The poppy field is connected to the carnation field, but neither of these fields offers a free bunch of flowers.\n\n5. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field, which offers a bunch of 50 peony flowers for free. However, the peony field is not directly connected to the rose field.\n\nBased on the connections, there is no direct path from the rose field to the peony field, which offers the free bunch of 50 peony flowers. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is simply the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"
