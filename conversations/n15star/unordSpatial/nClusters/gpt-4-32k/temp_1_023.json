Pete's Coffee is connected to Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works. Chickflea is connected to Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Nike. Marshalls is connected to Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, and Target. Carter Children is connected to Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works. Baskins and Robins is connected to Levis, GNC Live Well, and Target. Paris Baguette is connected to H&M and Zara. Nike is connected to Bath and Body Works. Levis is connected to GNC Live Well and Target. H&M is connected to Zara. Sephora is connected to Bath and Body Works. GNC Live Well is connected to Target. How many densely-connected store clusters do we have in this mall? A densely-connected cluster is a group of stores that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 stores."

Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara\n2. Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, Bath and Body Works\n3. Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well\n4. Marshalls, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Target\n5. Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, Bath and Body Works\n6. Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, Target\n\nThe clusters 1 and 4 share stores, so they can be merged into one cluster. The same happens with clusters 2 and 5. So, we have the following clusters after merging:\n1. Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Marshalls, Target\n2. Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, Bath and Body Works\n3. Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well\n4. Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, Target\n\nClusters 1 and 4 share stores, so they can be merged into one cluster. So, we finally have the following clusters after merging:\n1. Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Marshalls, Target, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well\n2. Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, Bath and Body Works\n3. Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well\n\nThere are 3 densely-connected clusters in total.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
