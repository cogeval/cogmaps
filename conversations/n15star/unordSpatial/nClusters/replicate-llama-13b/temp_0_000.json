To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in the flower county, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the BFS queue with the starting field (tulip field).\n\nStep 2: While the BFS queue is not empty, dequeue a field and explore its neighbors. If a field has a connection to another field that is not yet explored, add it to the BFS queue.\n\nStep 3: After exploring all fields, count the number of clusters found. A cluster is a group of fields that are connected to each other and have no unexplored fields between them.\n\nAnswer: There are 5 densely-connected field clusters in the flower county."
