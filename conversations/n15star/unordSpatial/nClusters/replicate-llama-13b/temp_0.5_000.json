The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in the flower county, I will use a systematic approach.\nStep 1: Identify all possible pairs of fields that are connected to each other.\nStep 2: Count the number of clusters that can be formed by grouping the fields into pairs.\nStep 3: Calculate the number of densely-connected field clusters by dividing the number of clusters by 2.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nStep 1: Identify all possible pairs of fields that are connected to each other.\n\nThere are 15 fields in total, and each field can be connected to any other field. Therefore, there are a total of 15 x 14 = 210 possible pairs of fields that are connected to each other.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of clusters that can be formed by grouping the fields into pairs.\n\nWe can group the fields into pairs as follows:\n\n1. Rose field and Lily field\n2. Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field\n3. Sunflower field and Orchid field\n4. Tulip field and Hydrangea field\n5. Daisy field and Lily field\n6.

Poppy field and Chrysanthemum field\n\nThere are a total of 15 pairs, and each pair can form a cluster. Therefore, there are 15 clusters in total.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of densely-connected field clusters by dividing the number of clusters by 2.\n\nSince each cluster has 2 fields, we can divide the number of clusters by 2 to find the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n\n15 clusters / 2 = 7 densely-connected field clusters\n\nAnswer: There are 7 densely-connected field clusters in the flower county."
