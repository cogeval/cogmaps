The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in this county, we can use the information given about the connections between the fields. \n\nStarting with the rose field, we see that it is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field. Following these connections, we find that the chrysanthemum field is also connected to the poppy field, and the poppy field is connected to the carnation field. This forms a cluster with three fields: rose, chrysanthemum, and poppy.\n\nNext, we move to the sunflower field, which is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. Following these connections, we find that the orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. This forms a cluster with four fields: sunflower, orchid, peony, and zinnia.\n\nMoving on to the tulip field, it is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. Following these connections, we find that the hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field and marigold field. This forms a cluster with four fields: tulip, hydrangea, daffodil, and marigold.\n\nContinuing with the daisy field, it is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. Following these connections, we find that the chrysanthemum field is also connected to the poppy field. This forms a cluster with four fields: daisy, lily, chrysanthemum, and poppy.\n\nNext, we move to the orchid field, which is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. Following these connections, we find that the peony field is also connected to the zinnia field. This forms a cluster with three fields: orchid, peony, and zinnia.\n\nMoving on to the hydrangea field, it is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. Following these connections, we find that the daffodil field is also connected to the marigold field. This forms a cluster with three fields: hydrangea, daffodil, and marigold.\n\nLastly, we have the lily field, which is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field. Following these connections, we find that there are no additional connections within this cluster.\n\nSo, in total, we have 7 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: there are 7 clusters"
