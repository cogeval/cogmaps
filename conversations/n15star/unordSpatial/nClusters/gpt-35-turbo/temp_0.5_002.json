The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be considered as a node in the graph, and the connections between fields represent the edges of the graph.\n\nLet's create a graph representation of the flower county:\n\n- Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n- Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n- Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n- Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n- Peony field: Zinnia\n- Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy\n- Carnation field: Zinnia\n- Marigold field: Lavender\n\nNow, we can identify the densely-connected field clusters by finding the connected components in this graph.\n\nStarting with the Rose field, we can explore the connected fields and mark them as visited. We repeat this process for all unvisited fields until we have covered all fields.\n\nThe clusters are as follows:\n1. Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n2. Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, Zinnia\n3. Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold\n4. Daisy, Lavender\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
