The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We will represent each field as a node, and the connections between fields as edges.\n\nFirst, let's list down all the connections between fields:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Peony field: Zinnia field\n- Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Carnation field: Zinnia field\n- Marigold field: Lavender field\n\nNow, let's identify the clusters by examining the connections. We can start with any field and explore all its connections to identify a cluster. Once we have identified a cluster, we can mark those fields as visited to avoid counting them again.\n\nStarting with the Rose field, we can identify the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\nCluster 2: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Zinnia field\nCluster 3: Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\nCluster 4: Daisy field\n\nSo, the number of densely-connected field clusters in this county is 4.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
