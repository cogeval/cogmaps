Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n2. Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n3. Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n4. Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n5. Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n6. Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n7. Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n8. Peony field: Zinnia\n9. Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender\n10. Chrysanthemum field: Poppy\n11. Carnation field: Zinnia\n12. Marigold field: Lavender\n\nNow, let's identify the clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\nCluster 2: Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, Zinnia\nCluster 3: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\nCluster 4: Daisy\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
