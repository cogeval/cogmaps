The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. The sunflower field is connected to the orchid, peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n3. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony fields.\n4. The daisy field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and lavender fields.\n5.
