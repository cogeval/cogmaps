The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Sunflower field is connected to the orchid, peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n3. Tulip field is connected to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony fields.\n4. Daisy field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and lavender fields.\n5. Orchid field is connected to the peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n6. Hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil, marigold, and lavender fields.\n7. Lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n8. Peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n9. Daffodil field is connected to the marigold and lavender fields.\n10. Chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n11. Carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n12.
