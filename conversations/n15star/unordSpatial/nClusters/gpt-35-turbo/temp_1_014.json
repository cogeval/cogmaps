The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

From the given connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n   - Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Carnation fields are all connected to each other.\n   - Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, and Zinnia fields are all connected to each other.\n   - Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, and Lavender fields are all connected to each other.\n   - Daisy field is not connected to any other field.\n\n2. Since Daisy field is not connected to any other field, it cannot form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Therefore, we have 3 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
