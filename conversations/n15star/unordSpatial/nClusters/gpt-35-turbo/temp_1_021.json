Create a graph representation of the connections between the fields.\n2. Traverse the graph to identify the clusters.\n3. Count the clusters that have a minimum of 2 fields.\n\nLet's start by creating the graph representation of the connections:\n\nGraph representation:\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field.\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field.\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field.\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field.\n- Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field.\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field.\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field.\n- Peony field: Zinnia field.\n- Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field.\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field.\n- Carnation field: Zinnia field.\n- Marigold field: Lavender field.\n\nNow, let's traverse the graph to identify the clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field.\nCluster 2: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Zinnia field.\nCluster 3: Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field.\n\nFinally, let's count the clusters that have a minimum of 2 fields:\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
