The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Create a graph representation of the fields and their connections.\n2. Traverse the graph and identify the clusters using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.\n3. Count the number of clusters with a minimum of 2 fields.\n\nLet's start by creating the graph representation:\n\n- Create a list of fields and their connections:\n  - Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n  - Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n  - Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n  - Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n  - Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n  - Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n  - Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n  - Peony field: Zinnia\n  - Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender\n  - Chrysanthemum field: Poppy\n  - Carnation field: Zinnia\n  - Marigold field: Lavender\n\nBased on these connections, we can represent the graph as follows:\n\nRose - Lily - Chrysanthemum - Poppy\n|     /\nCarnation\n\nSunflower - Orchid - Peony - Zinnia\n          \\\n        Carnation\n\nTulip - Hydrangea - Daffodil - Marigold\n                          \\\n                        Lavender\n\nDaisy - Lily - Chrysanthemum - Poppy\n      /\nLavender\n\nOrchid - Peony - Zinnia\nCarnation\n\nHydrangea - Daffodil - Marigold\n                \\\n              Lavender\n\nLily - Chrysanthemum - Poppy\n\nPeony - Zinnia\n\nDaffodil - Marigold\n         \\\n       Lavender\n\nChrysanthemum - Poppy\n\nCarnation - Zinnia\n\nMarigold - Lavender\n\nNow, we can perform a DFS to identify the clusters:\n\n- Initialize an empty list to store the clusters.\n- Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n- For each field:\n  - If the field has not been visited:\n    - Create a new cluster and add the field to it.\n    - Perform a DFS starting from the current field, adding all connected fields to the cluster.\n    - Add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n- Count the clusters with a minimum of 2 fields.\n\nThe clusters identified in this flower county are:\n\n1. Rose - Lily - Chrysanthemum - Poppy - Carnation\n2. Sunflower - Orchid - Peony - Zinnia - Carnation\n3. Tulip - Hydrangea - Daffodil - Marigold - Lavender\n4. Daisy - Lily - Chrysanthemum - Poppy - Lavender\n5. Orchid - Peony - Zinnia\n6. Hydrangea - Daffodil - Marigold - Lavender\n7. Chrysanthemum - Poppy\n8. Carnation - Zinnia\n9. Marigold - Lavender\n\nAnswer: there are 9 clusters."
