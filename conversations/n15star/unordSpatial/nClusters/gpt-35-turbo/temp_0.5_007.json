Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections. Each field will be a node, and the connections between fields will be represented by edges.\n\n2. Initialize a variable `cluster_count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n\n3. For each field, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all the connected fields. During the DFS, mark each visited field as \"visited\" to avoid revisiting it.\n\n4. If the DFS visits more than one field, increment `cluster_count` by 1. This indicates that a new densely-connected field cluster has been found.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all unvisited fields in the graph.\n\n6. The final value of `cluster_count` will be the number of densely-connected field clusters in the county.\n\nAnswer: there are 8 clusters"
