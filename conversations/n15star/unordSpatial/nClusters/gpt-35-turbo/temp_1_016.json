The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Starting with the rose field, we have a cluster of rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n2. Moving on to the sunflower field, we have a cluster of sunflower, orchid, peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n3. Next, the tulip field forms a cluster with hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony fields.\n4. The daisy field forms a cluster with lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and lavender fields.\n5. The orchid field forms a cluster with peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n6. The hydrangea field forms a cluster with daffodil, marigold, and lavender fields.\n7. The remaining connections between lily and chrysanthemum fields do not form a cluster as there are no other fields connected to them.\n8. Similarly, the peony and zinnia fields do not form a cluster as there are no other fields connected to them.\n9. The daffodil field forms a cluster with the marigold and lavender fields.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: There are 6 clusters."
