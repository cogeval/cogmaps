We can start with one field and perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all the connected fields. If we encounter a field that has already been visited, we can skip it to avoid counting the same cluster multiple times.\n\nBy repeating this process for all the fields, we can count the total number of clusters.\n\nLet's start by building the graph representation."
