The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We will create a graph where each flower field represents a node, and the connections between the fields represent edges. \n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n- Rose Field (RF) is connected to Lily Field (LF), Chrysanthemum Field (CF), Poppy Field (PF), and Carnation Field (CAF).\n- Sunflower Field (SF) is connected to Orchid Field (OF), Peony Field (PF), Carnation Field (CAF), and Zinnia Field (ZF).\n- Tulip Field (TF) is connected to Hydrangea Field (HF), Daffodil Field (DF), Marigold Field (MF), and Peony Field (PF).\n- Daisy Field (DF) is connected to Lily Field (LF), Chrysanthemum Field (CF), Poppy Field (PF), and Lavender Field (LAF).\n- Orchid Field (OF) is connected to Peony Field (PF), Carnation Field (CAF), and Zinnia Field (ZF).\n- Hydrangea Field (HF) is connected to Daffodil Field (DF), Marigold Field (MF), and Lavender Field (LAF).\n- Lily Field (LF) is connected to Chrysanthemum Field (CF) and Poppy Field (PF).\n- Peony Field (PF) is connected to Zinnia Field (ZF).\n- Daffodil Field (DF) is connected to Marigold Field (MF) and Lavender Field (LAF).\n- Chrysanthemum Field (CF) is connected to Poppy Field (PF).\n- Carnation Field (CAF) is connected to Zinnia Field (ZF).\n- Marigold Field (MF) is connected to Lavender Field (LAF).\n\nNow, we can visually identify the densely-connected field clusters by finding the connected components of the graph. Each connected component represents a densely-connected cluster.\n\nBy analyzing the graph, we can identify the following densely-connected field clusters:\n\nCluster 1: RF, LF, CF, PF, CAF, DF, MF, LAF\nCluster 2: SF, OF, ZF\nCluster 3: TF, HF\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
