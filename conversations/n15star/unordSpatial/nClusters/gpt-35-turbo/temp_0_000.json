The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We can represent each field as a node and the connections between them as edges. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to find all the clusters.\n\nStarting with the rose field, we can traverse the graph using depth-first search (DFS) and mark all the nodes that are connected to it. We can repeat this process for all unmarked nodes until all nodes are marked. Each time we complete a DFS traversal, we will have found a new cluster.\n\nAfter applying DFS to all unmarked nodes, we find that there are 4 densely-connected field clusters in the county. \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
