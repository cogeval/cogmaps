Pete's Coffee is connected to Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works. Chickflea is connected to Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Nike. Marshalls is connected to Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, and Target. Carter Children is connected to Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works. Baskins and Robins is connected to Levis, GNC Live Well, and Target. Paris Baguette is connected to H&M and Zara. Nike is connected to Bath and Body Works. Levis is connected to GNC Live Well and Target. H&M is connected to Zara. Sephora is connected to Bath and Body Works. GNC Live Well is connected to Target. How many densely-connected store clusters do we have in this mall? A densely-connected cluster is a group of stores that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 stores."

Each store can be represented as a node, and the connections between stores can be represented as edges. \n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n```\nStarbucks -- Paris Baguette -- H&M -- Zara -- Sephora -- Bath and Body Works -- Nike\nPete's Coffee -- Carter Children -- Nike -- Sephora -- Bath and Body Works\nChickflea -- Baskins and Robins -- Levis -- GNC Live Well -- Nike -- Target\nMarshalls -- Paris Baguette -- H&M -- Zara -- Target\n```\n\nTo find the densely-connected clusters, we can use the concept of cliques. A clique is a subset of nodes in a graph where every node is connected to every other node in the subset. In this case, a clique of size 3 or more represents a densely-connected cluster of stores.\n\nUsing this definition, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n- Starbucks, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Nike (size 7)\n- Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, Bath and Body Works (size 5)\n- Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, Nike, Target (size 5)\n- Marshalls, Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, Target (size 5)\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 4 clusters."
