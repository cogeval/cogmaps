The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We can represent each field as a node and the connections between fields as edges. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to identify the clusters.\n\nStarting with the rose field, we can traverse the graph using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all the nodes that are connected to it. We can mark each visited node to avoid revisiting it and continue the traversal until all the nodes are visited.\n\nUsing DFS, we can identify the following clusters:\n- Cluster 1: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n- Cluster 2: Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, Zinnia\n- Cluster 3: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n- Cluster 4: Daisy\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 4 clusters."
