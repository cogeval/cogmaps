The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We can represent each field as a node in a graph, and the connections between fields as edges.\n\n1. First, let's create a graph representation of the fields and their connections:\n\n   - Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n   - Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n   - Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n   - Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n   - Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n   - Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n   - Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n   - Peony field: Zinnia field\n   - Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n   - Carnation field: Zinnia field\n   - Marigold field: Lavender field\n\n2. Next, we can identify the clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on the graph. We start from each field and explore its connections recursively until we cannot find any more connected fields.\n\n3. Count the number of clusters that have a minimum of 2 fields.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters."
