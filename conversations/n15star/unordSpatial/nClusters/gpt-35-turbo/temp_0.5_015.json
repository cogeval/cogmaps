The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be considered as a node in the graph, and the connections between fields represent the edges.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the fields and their connections:\n   - Create a list of all the fields: rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation, sunflower, orchid, peony, zinnia, tulip, hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, lavender, daisy.\n   - Create a dictionary to represent the connections between fields. Each field will be a key, and its value will be a list of connected fields.\n   - Based on the given information, populate the dictionary with the connections between fields.\n\n2. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph to find the connected components:\n   - Initialize a counter for the number of clusters.\n   - Initialize a set to keep track of visited fields.\n   - Iterate through each field:\n     - If the field has not been visited:\n       - Increment the cluster counter by 1.\n       - Start a DFS or BFS from the current field, marking all visited fields.\n   - The final value of the cluster counter will be the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n\n3. Output the result:\n   - Return the number of clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
