The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

We will create a graph representation of the fields, with each field as a node and the connections between fields as edges.\n\n2. Starting with an empty list of clusters, we will iterate through each field in the county.\n\n3. For each field, we will perform a depth-first search (DFS) to identify all fields that are part of the same densely-connected cluster.\n\n4. During the DFS, we will mark each visited field and add it to the current cluster.\n\n5. Once the DFS is complete for a field, we will add the cluster to the list of clusters if it contains at least 2 fields.\n\n6. After iterating through all fields, we will have a list of densely-connected field clusters.\n\n7. Finally, we will count the number of clusters in the list and provide the answer.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
