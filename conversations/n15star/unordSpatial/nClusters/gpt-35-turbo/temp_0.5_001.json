The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in this county, we can start by creating a graph to represent the connections between the fields. Each field will be represented as a node, and the connections between the fields will be represented as edges.\n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n- Rose field -> Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Sunflower field -> Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Tulip field -> Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Daisy field -> Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Orchid field -> Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Hydrangea field -> Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Lily field -> Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Peony field -> Zinnia field\n- Daffodil field -> Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Chrysanthemum field -> Poppy field\n- Carnation field -> Zinnia field\n- Marigold field -> Lavender field\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected field clusters. We can do this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each field and counting the number of fields visited.\n\nStarting from the Rose field, we can visit the following fields: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field, Orchid field, Peony field, Zinnia field. This forms a densely-connected field cluster.\n\nNext, starting from the Sunflower field, we can visit the following fields: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field. This forms another densely-connected field cluster.\n\nStarting from the Tulip field, we can visit the following fields: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field. This forms another densely-connected field cluster.\n\nStarting from the Daisy field, we can visit the following fields: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field. This forms another densely-connected field cluster.\n\nStarting from the Hydrangea field, we can visit the following fields: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field. This forms another densely-connected field cluster.\n\nFinally, starting from the Daffodil field, we can visit the following fields: Marigold field, Lavender field. This forms the last densely-connected field cluster.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
