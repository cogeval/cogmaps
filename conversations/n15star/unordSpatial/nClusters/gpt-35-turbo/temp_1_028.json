Create a graph representing the connections between the fields.\n2. Each field will be represented by a node, and the connections will be represented by edges between the nodes.\n3. Iterate through each field and perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that field to identify all connected fields.\n4. Mark each field as visited to avoid redundancy.\n5. Count the number of DFS iterations performed. Each iteration represents a densely-connected field cluster.\n6. Return the final count.\n\nBased on the given information, let's calculate the number of densely-connected field clusters:\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
