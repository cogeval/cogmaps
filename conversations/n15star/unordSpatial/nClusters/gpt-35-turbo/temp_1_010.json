The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be represented as a node, and the connections between the fields can be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph to represent the connections between the fields:\n\n- Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n- Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n- Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n- Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n- Peony field: Zinnia\n- Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy\n- Carnation field: Zinnia\n- Marigold field: Lavender\n\nNow, let's find the connected components in this graph. \n\nStarting with the first field, we traverse the graph using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to find all the fields connected to it. We repeat this process for any remaining unvisited fields until all fields have been visited.\n\nAfter traversing the graph, we count the number of distinct groups or clusters of fields that we have encountered. These clusters represent the densely-connected field clusters in the county.\n\nNow, let's perform the DFS/BFS traversal and count the clusters:\n\n- Start with the Rose field and traverse its connected fields (Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation).\n- Move to the Sunflower field and traverse its connected fields (Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia).\n- Move to the Tulip field and traverse its connected fields (Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony).\n- Move to the Daisy field and traverse its connected fields (Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender).\n- Move to the Orchid field and traverse its connected fields (Peony, Carnation, Zinnia).\n- Move to the Hydrangea field and traverse its connected fields (Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender).\n- Move to the Lily field and traverse its connected fields (Chrysanthemum, Poppy).\n- Move to the Peony field and traverse its connected fields (Zinnia).\n- Move to the Daffodil field and traverse its connected fields (Marigold, Lavender).\n- Move to the Chrysanthemum field and traverse its connected fields (Poppy).\n- Move to the Carnation field and traverse its connected fields (Zinnia).\n- Move to the Marigold field and traverse its connected fields (Lavender).\n\nAfter performing the DFS/BFS traversal, we find that there are 5 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
