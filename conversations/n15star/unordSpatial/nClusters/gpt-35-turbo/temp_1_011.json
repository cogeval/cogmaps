The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Rose field: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, carnation field.\n2. Lily field: chrysanthemum field, poppy field.\n3. Chrysanthemum field: poppy field.\n4. Poppy field: no additional connections.\n5. Carnation field: zinnia field.\n6. Sunflower field: orchid field, peony field, carnation field, zinnia field.\n7. Orchid field: peony field, carnation field, zinnia field.\n8. Peony field: zinnia field.\n9. Zinnia field: no additional connections.\n10. Tulip field: hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, peony field.\n11. Hydrangea field: daffodil field, marigold field, lavender field.\n12. Daffodil field: marigold field, lavender field.\n13. Marigold field: lavender field.\n14. Daisy field: lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, lavender field.\n15. Lavender field: no additional connections.\n\nNext, we can determine the clusters by traversing the connections and identifying groups of fields that are connected to each other. \n\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\nCluster 2: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\nCluster 3: Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\nCluster 4: Daisy field\n\nTherefore, the final outcome is:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
