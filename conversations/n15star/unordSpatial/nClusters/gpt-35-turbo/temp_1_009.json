The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Rose field is connected to Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Carnation fields.\n2. Sunflower field is connected to Orchid, Peony, Carnation, and Zinnia fields.\n3. Tulip field is connected to Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, and Peony fields.\n4. Daisy field is connected to Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Lavender fields.\n5. Orchid field is connected to Peony, Carnation, and Zinnia fields.\n6. Hydrangea field is connected to Daffodil, Marigold, and Lavender fields.\n7. Lily field is connected to Chrysanthemum and Poppy fields.\n8. Peony field is connected to Zinnia field.\n9. Daffodil field is connected to Marigold and Lavender fields.\n10. Chrysanthemum field is connected to Poppy field.\n11. Carnation field is connected to Zinnia field.\n12. Marigold field is connected to Lavender field.\n\nBased on these connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n\n1. Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Carnation fields.\n2. Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, and Zinnia fields.\n3. Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, and Marigold fields.\n4. Daisy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Lavender fields.\n\nAnswer: There are 4 clusters."
