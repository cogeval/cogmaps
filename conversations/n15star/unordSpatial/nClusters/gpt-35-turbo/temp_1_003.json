The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections.\n2. Traverse the graph and identify the densely-connected clusters.\n3. Count the number of clusters found.\n\nLet's start by creating the graph:\n\nGraph representation:\n- Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation.\n- Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia.\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony.\n- Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender.\n- Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia.\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender.\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy.\n- Peony field: Zinnia.\n- Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender.\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy.\n- Carnation field: Zinnia.\n- Marigold field: Lavender.\n\nNow let's identify the clusters:\n\n1. Starting from the Rose field, we can visit the following fields: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Carnation.\n2. Starting from the Sunflower field, we can visit the following fields: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, and Zinnia.\n3. Starting from the Tulip field, we can visit the following fields: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, and Peony.\n4. Starting from the Daisy field, we can visit the following fields: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Lavender.\n5. Starting from the Orchid field, we can visit the following fields: Peony, Carnation, and Zinnia.\n6. Starting from the Hydrangea field, we can visit the following fields: Daffodil, Marigold, and Lavender.\n7. Starting from the Lily field, we can visit the following fields: Chrysanthemum and Poppy.\n8. Starting from the Peony field, we can visit the following field: Zinnia.\n9. Starting from the Daffodil field, we can visit the following fields: Marigold and Lavender.\n10. Starting from the Chrysanthemum field, we can visit the following field: Poppy.\n11. Starting from the Carnation field, we can visit the following field: Zinnia.\n12. Starting from the Marigold field, we can visit the following field: Lavender.\n\nBased on the connections, we have the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field.\n2. Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field.\n3. Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field.\n4. Daisy field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
