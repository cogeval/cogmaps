The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in this county, we can use the concept of graph theory. Each field can be represented as a node in a graph, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the fields and their connections based on the given information:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n- Peony field: Zinnia field\n- Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Carnation field: Zinnia field\n- Marigold field: Lavender field\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected field clusters:\n\n1. Starting with the Rose field, we can follow its connections to the Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Carnation field.\n2. From the Lily field, we can follow its connections to the Chrysanthemum field and Poppy field.\n3. The Chrysanthemum field is connected to the Poppy field.\n4. Moving on to the Daisy field, we can follow its connections to the Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, and Lavender field.\n5. The Poppy field is connected to the Chrysanthemum field.\n6. The Sunflower field is connected to the Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, and Zinnia field.\n7. The Orchid field is connected to the Peony field and Carnation field.\n8. The Peony field is connected to the Zinnia field.\n9. The Tulip field is connected to the Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Peony field.\n10. The Daffodil field is connected to the Marigold field and Lavender field.\n11. The Marigold field is connected to the Lavender field.\n12. The Hydrangea field is connected to the Daffodil field, Marigold field, and Lavender field.\n13. The Carnation field is connected to the Zinnia field.\n14. The Zinnia field is connected to no other field.\n\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following densely-connected field clusters:\n\n1. Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n2. Daisy field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n3. Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n4. Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n5. Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field, Hydrangea field\n\nAnswer: There are 5 clusters."
