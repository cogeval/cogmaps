The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be represented as a node, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nLet's create a graph to visualize the connections between the fields:\n\n- Rose field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n- Sunflower field: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n- Daisy field: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n- Orchid field: Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n- Peony field: Zinnia\n- Daffodil field: Marigold, Lavender\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy\n- Carnation field: Zinnia\n- Marigold field: Lavender\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected field clusters:\n\n1. Rose field cluster: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\n2. Sunflower field cluster: Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n3. Tulip field cluster: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\n4. Daisy field cluster: Daisy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\n5. Orchid field cluster: Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\n6. Hydrangea field cluster: Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n7. Lily field cluster: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n8. Peony field cluster: Peony, Zinnia\n9. Daffodil field cluster: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n10. Chrysanthemum field cluster: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n11. Carnation field cluster: Carnation, Zinnia\n12. Marigold field cluster: Marigold, Lavender\n\nAnswer: there are 12 clusters."
