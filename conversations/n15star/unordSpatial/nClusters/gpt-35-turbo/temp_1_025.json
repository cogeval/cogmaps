The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field will be represented as a node, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges.\n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\nRose -> Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\nSunflower -> Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\nTulip -> Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\nDaisy -> Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Lavender\nOrchid -> Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\nHydrangea -> Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\nLily -> Chrysanthemum, Poppy\nPeony -> Zinnia\nDaffodil -> Marigold, Lavender\nChrysanthemum -> Poppy\nCarnation -> Zinnia\nMarigold -> Lavender\n\nNow we can use graph traversal algorithms to find the densely-connected clusters in the graph. One such algorithm is Depth-First Search (DFS). By performing DFS starting from each field, we can identify all the fields that are connected to it.\n\nBy performing DFS starting from each field, we find the following clusters:\nCluster 1: Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Carnation\nCluster 2: Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, Carnation, Zinnia\nCluster 3: Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, Marigold, Peony\nCluster 4: Daisy, Lavender\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: there are 4 clusters."
