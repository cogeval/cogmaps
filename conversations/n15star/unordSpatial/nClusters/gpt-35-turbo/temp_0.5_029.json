Each flower field can be considered as a vertex, and the connections between the fields can be represented as edges.\n\nStep 1: Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections.\n\n- The rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n- The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n- The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field.\n- The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n- The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n- The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n- The peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n- The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field.\n- The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n- The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n- The marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n\nStep 2: Identify the densely-connected field clusters.\n\nTo determine the densely-connected field clusters, we need to find groups of fields that are connected to each other with a minimum of 2 fields. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph and identify these clusters.\n\nStarting from each unvisited field, perform a DFS to visit all connected fields and mark them as visited. Count the number of fields visited in each DFS traversal as a densely-connected field cluster.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n\nCount the number of densely-connected field clusters identified in Step 2.\n\nAnswer: there are 7 clusters"
