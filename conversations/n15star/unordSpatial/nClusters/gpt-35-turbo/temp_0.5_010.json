The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each flower field can be represented as a node in a graph, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the connections between the fields:\n\n1. Rose field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and carnation field.\n2. Sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n3. Tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.\n4. Daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field.\n5. Orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n6. Hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n7. Lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n8. Peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n9. Daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field.\n10. Chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n11. Carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n12. Marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n\nNow, let's identify the clusters of densely-connected fields:\n\nCluster 1: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\nCluster 2: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Peony field, Zinnia field\nCluster 3: Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\nCluster 4: Daisy field\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
