The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in this flower county, we can use the concept of connected components in a graph.\n\n1. First, let's represent the connections between the fields as a graph, where each field is a vertex and the connections between fields are edges.\n\n2. Based on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n   - Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n   - Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n   - Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n   - Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n   - Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n   - Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n   - Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field\n   - Peony field: Zinnia field\n   - Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n   - Carnation field: Zinnia field\n   - Marigold field: Lavender field\n\n3. Now, we can identify the connected components in the graph. A connected component is a subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the connected components.\n\n4. Starting with the first field (Rose field), we perform a DFS traversal to identify all the fields connected to it. We mark each visited field as we traverse through the graph.\n\n5. After completing the DFS traversal for the first field, we move on to the next unvisited field (Sunflower field) and repeat the process.\n\n6. We continue this process until we have visited all the fields in the graph. Each time we start a new DFS traversal, we have found a new densely-connected field cluster.\n\n7. Count the number of densely-connected field clusters we found during the DFS traversals.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters."
