We have Paris Baguette, H&M, Zara, and Sephora. From this group, we can see that Paris Baguette is also connected to Marshalls, which in turn is connected to Target, H&M, and Zara. This creates a cluster of 6 stores (Starbucks, Paris Baguette, Marshalls, H&M, Zara, and Target).\n\nNext, let's move on to Pete's Coffee. We have Carter Children, Nike, Sephora, and Bath and Body Works. From this group, we can see that Carter Children is also connected to Nike and Bath and Body Works. This creates a cluster of 3 stores (Pete's Coffee, Carter Children, and Nike). \n\nMoving on to Chickflea, we have Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Nike. From this group, we can see that Baskins and Robins is also connected to Levis and GNC Live Well, which in turn is connected to Target. This creates a cluster of 5 stores (Chickflea, Baskins and Robins, Levis, GNC Live Well, and Target).\n\nFinally, we have Bath and Body Works, which is connected to Sephora and Nike, and Levis, which is connected to GNC Live Well and Target. These two stores do not form a cluster with any other stores.\n\nTherefore, we have 3 densely-connected clusters in this mall. \n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
