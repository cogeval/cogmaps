The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.

The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected field clusters in this county, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent each field as a node in a graph, and the connections between the fields as edges. \n\nThen, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph and identify the clusters. We start with an unexplored node and keep traversing the graph until we reach a node that has no unexplored neighbors. This forms one cluster. We then repeat the same process with any remaining unexplored nodes to find all the clusters.\n\nUsing this method, we can identify 6 clusters: \n\n- Rose, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, and Carnation fields\n- Sunflower, Orchid, Peony, and Zinnia fields\n- Tulip, Hydrangea, Daffodil, and Marigold fields\n- Daisy and Lavender fields\n- Peony and Zinnia fields\n- Daffodil, Marigold, and Lavender fields\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters."
