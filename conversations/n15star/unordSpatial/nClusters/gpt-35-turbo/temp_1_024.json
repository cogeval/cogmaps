The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field. The daisy field is connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and lavender field. The orchid field is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil field, marigold field, and lavender field. The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, and poppy field. The peony field is connected to the zinnia field. The daffodil field is connected to the marigold field and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to poppy field. The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field. The marigold field is connected to the lavender field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Identify the fields that are connected to each other.\n   - The rose field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and carnation fields.\n   - The sunflower field is connected to the orchid, peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n   - The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, and peony fields.\n   - The daisy field is connected to the lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, and lavender fields.\n   - The orchid field is connected to the peony, carnation, and zinnia fields.\n   - The hydrangea field is connected to the daffodil, marigold, and lavender fields.\n   - The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum and poppy fields.\n   - The peony field is connected to the zinnia field.\n   - The daffodil field is connected to the marigold and lavender fields.\n   - The chrysanthemum field is connected to the poppy field.\n   - The carnation field is connected to the zinnia field.\n   - The marigold field is connected to the lavender field.\n\n2. Determine the clusters of densely-connected fields.\n   - From the connections mentioned, we can observe the following clusters:\n     - Cluster 1: rose, lily, chrysanthemum, poppy, carnation\n     - Cluster 2: sunflower, orchid, peony, zinnia\n     - Cluster 3: tulip, hydrangea, daffodil, marigold, lavender\n     - Cluster 4: daisy\n\n3. Count the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n   - From the above clusters, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected field clusters in this county.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
