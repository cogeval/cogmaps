The sunflower field is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field. The tulip field is connected to the hydrangea field, daffodil field, marigold field, and peony field.

We will create a graph where each field is represented as a node, and the connections between fields are represented as edges.\n\nStep 1: Create the graph representation:\n- Create a graph with 15 nodes, representing the 15 flower fields.\n- Add edges between connected fields based on the given connections.\n\nStep 2: Find the densely-connected clusters:\n- Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph to identify clusters.\n- Start the search from each unvisited node and explore all connected nodes.\n- If a cluster has at least 2 nodes, count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected clusters:\n- Count the number of clusters identified in Step 2.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
