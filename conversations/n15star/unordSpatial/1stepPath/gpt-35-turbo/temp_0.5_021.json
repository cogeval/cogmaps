Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections as edges:\n\n- Sunflower field -> Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field -> Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Peony field -> Zinnia field\n- Carnation field -> Zinnia field\n\nNow, we can use a graph search algorithm to find the shortest path. One common algorithm for this is Breadth-First Search (BFS). Starting from the sunflower field, we will explore the graph level by level until we reach the peony field.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\nLevel 0: Sunflower field\nLevel 1: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\nLevel 2: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\nLevel 3: Zinnia field\n\nThe shortest path from the sunflower field to the peony field is: Sunflower field, Peony field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field, Peony field"
