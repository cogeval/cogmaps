Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation is as follows:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Lily field: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Daisy field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Poppy field\n- Poppy field: Daisy field\n- Daisy field: Lavender field\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field: Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Peony field: Zinnia field\n- Zinnia field: \n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Hydrangea field: Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Daffodil field: Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Marigold field: Lavender field\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the daisy field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the chrysanthemum field.\n2. Check its neighbors: Poppy field.\n3. Check the neighbors of the poppy field: Daisy field.\n4. The shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the daisy field is: Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy.\n\nAnswer: Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy"
