We will start from the peony field and traverse the graph to reach the tulip field.\n\n1. Start at the peony field.\n2. From the peony field, we can go to the zinnia field.\n3. From the zinnia field, we can go to the sunflower field.\n4. From the sunflower field, we can go to the orchid field.\n5. From the orchid field, we can go to the tulip field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the peony field to the tulip field is: \"Peony, Zinnia, Sunflower, Orchid, Tulip\".\n\nAnswer: Peony, Zinnia, Sunflower, Orchid, Tulip"
