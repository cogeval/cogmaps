Start at the lily field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the lily field: chrysanthemum field and poppy field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Repeat the process for each field in the queue until the daisy field is reached.\n5. Keep track of the path taken from the lily field to each field visited.\n6. Once the daisy field is reached, return the path taken.\n\nUsing this approach, the shortest path from the lily field to the daisy field is:\n\nAnswer: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy, Daisy"
