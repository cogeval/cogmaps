Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation is as follows:\n\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the poppy field, lily field, and rose field.\n- Poppy field: connected to the chrysanthemum field, daisy field, and lily field.\n- Lily field: connected to the chrysanthemum field, daisy field, and poppy field.\n- Daisy field: connected to the lily field, chrysanthemum field, and rose field.\n- Rose field: connected to the daisy field.\n\nNow, we can use a shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the rose field.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the rose field is:\n\nChrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Daisy field, Rose field.\n\nAnswer: Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Daisy field, Rose field."
