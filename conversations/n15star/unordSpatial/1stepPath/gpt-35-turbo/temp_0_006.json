Let's create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\n- Rose field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Lily field: Rose field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Daisy field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Lily field, Lily field, Poppy field, Carnation field\n- Poppy field: Rose field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Daisy field\n- Carnation field: Rose field, Sunflower field, Orchid field, Zinnia field, Chrysanthemum field\n- Sunflower field: Orchid field, Peony field, Carnation field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field: Sunflower field, Peony field, Carnation field\n- Peony field: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Zinnia field\n- Zinnia field: Sunflower field, Carnation field, Peony field\n- Tulip field: Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Peony field\n- Hydrangea field: Tulip field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Daffodil field: Hydrangea field, Tulip field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Marigold field: Tulip field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Lavender field\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Lavender field: Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Daffodil field, Marigold field\n- Daisy field: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field, Poppy field, Lavender field\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the lily field to the chrysanthemum field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the lily field.\n2. Add the lily field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the chrysanthemum field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the lily field to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nUsing the breadth-first search algorithm, the shortest path from the lily field to the chrysanthemum field is:\n\nAnswer: Lily field, Chrysanthemum field"
