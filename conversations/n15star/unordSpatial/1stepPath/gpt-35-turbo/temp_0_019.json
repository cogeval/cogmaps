Start at the carnation field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields connected to the carnation field: zinnia field.\n3. Since the zinnia field is the destination, we have found the shortest path.\n4. The shortest path from the carnation field to the zinnia field is: carnation, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Carnation, Zinnia"
