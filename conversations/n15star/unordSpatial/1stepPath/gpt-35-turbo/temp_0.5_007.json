Check if the lily field is connected to the poppy field. If yes, the shortest path is just \"lily, poppy\". If not, continue to the next step.\n3. Create a queue and add the lily field to the queue.\n4. Create a visited set and add the lily field to the set.\n5. Create a dictionary to store the parent of each flower field.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a flower field from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued flower field is connected to the poppy field. If yes, break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each adjacent flower field of the dequeued field that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the adjacent flower field to the visited set.\n     - Add the adjacent flower field to the queue.\n     - Set the parent of the adjacent flower field as the dequeued field in the dictionary.\n7. If the loop is broken, it means the shortest path has been found.\n8. Starting from the poppy field, use the parent dictionary to backtrack and find the shortest path.\n9. Return the shortest path as a list of flower names, including \"lily\", separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Lily, Chrysanthemum, Poppy"
