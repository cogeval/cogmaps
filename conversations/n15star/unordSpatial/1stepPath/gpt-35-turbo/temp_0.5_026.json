Start at the orchid field.\n2. Add the orchid field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n4. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n5. If the dequeued field is the carnation field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n6. If the dequeued field has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue its adjacent fields.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the graph representation and the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from the orchid field to the carnation field is:\n\nOrchid field, Zinnia field, Carnation field\n\nAnswer: Orchid field, Zinnia field, Carnation field"
