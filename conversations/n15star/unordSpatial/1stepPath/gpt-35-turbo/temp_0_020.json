Starting from the sunflower field, we can see that it is connected to the orchid field, peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n2. Since we want to reach the orchid field, we will choose the orchid field as the next destination.\n3. From the orchid field, we can see that it is connected to the peony field, carnation field, and zinnia field.\n4. Since the orchid field is already visited, we will choose the peony field as the next destination.\n5. From the peony field, we can see that it is connected to the zinnia field.\n6. Since the zinnia field is not yet visited, we will choose the zinnia field as the next destination.\n7. From the zinnia field, we can see that it is not connected to the orchid field.\n8. Since the orchid field is our target destination, we have reached the end of the path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the orchid field is: Sunflower, Orchid.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Orchid"
