Add the poppy field to a queue.\n2. Check the first flower field in the queue.\n3. If it is the daisy field, stop and return the path.\n4. Otherwise, add all the neighboring flower fields of the current field to the queue.\n5. Mark the current field as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until either the daisy field is found or the queue becomes empty.\n\nApplying the breadth-first search algorithm, we find the following shortest path from the poppy field to the daisy field: Poppy -> Lily -> Daisy.\n\nAnswer: Poppy, Lily, Daisy"
