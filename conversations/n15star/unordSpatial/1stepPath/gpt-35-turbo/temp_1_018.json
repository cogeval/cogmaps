Let's map out the connections to determine the shortest path:\n\n- The carnation field is connected to the poppy field.\n- The poppy field is connected to the lily field.\n- The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n- The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation field (loop).\n- The chrysanthemum field is also connected to the poppy field.\n- The poppy field is connected to the lily field.\n- The lily field is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n- The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation field (loop).\n- The carnation field is also connected to the zinnia field.\n- The zinnia field is connected to the orchid field.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that the shortest path from the carnation field to the orchid field is:\n\nCarnation, Poppy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia, Orchid\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, starting from the carnation field and following the shortest path to the orchid field, are:\n\nAnswer: Carnation, Poppy, Lily, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia, Orchid"
