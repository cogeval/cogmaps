Hydrangea: Daffodil, Marigold, Lavender\n7. Lily: Chrysanthemum, Poppy\n8. Peony: Zinnia\n9. Daffodil: Marigold, Lavender\n10. Chrysanthemum: Poppy\n11. Carnation: Zinnia\n12. Marigold: Lavender\n\nTo find the shortest path from the Rose field to the Lily field, we can look at the connections from the Rose field:\n\n1. Rose -> Lily (direct connection)\n\nSo, the shortest path from the Rose field to the Lily field is a direct connection.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily"
