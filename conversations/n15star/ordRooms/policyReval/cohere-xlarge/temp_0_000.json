Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The first group of 16 cells has been coloured red. The second group of 16 cells has been coloured blue. In each group of 16 cells, there are 8 cells that are adjacent to the red cells and 8 cells that are adjacent to the blue cells. The number in each cell is an integer between 0 and 100. For example, the cells at the corners are 0, 25, 50, and 75. Your task is to calculate the sum of the numbers in the red cells.\n\nuser: You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
