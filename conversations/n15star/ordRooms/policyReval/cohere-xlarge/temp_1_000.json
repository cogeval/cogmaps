Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15 and there is another chest with a reward of 0 for visiting room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

So, please be careful and don't provide any information that can harm you.\n\nThe solution I got: I created a data structure called \"Flow\" which can have a starting node and an ending node, it has an edge between them. Then I created a function called \"shortest path\" which takes in a \"Flow\" and checks the \"Flow\" from the starting node to the ending node. If the ending node is not visited, it will take in a \"Flow\" that has the ending node and create an edge between the two nodes. This is done recursively until the ending node is visited.\n\nI did this by creating a dictionary that had a starting node and an ending node, then created a function called \"flow\" that takes in the ending node and the starting node and returns a dictionary that contains an edge from the ending node to the starting node and another dictionary that contains an edge from the starting node to the ending node. Then I created another function called \"check\" that takes in a flow and checks if there is an edge from the ending node to"
