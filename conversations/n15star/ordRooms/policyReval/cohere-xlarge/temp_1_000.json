Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The order of the numbers does not matter, but the rooms must be listed in the order they are connected.\n\nExplanation: From room 1, the shortest path that yields the most reward is room 1,7,8,11,13,14,15. Since room 8 has a reward of 50, this path yields a total of 50 + 10 = 60 reward. Note that if we had chosen room 8,11,14,15, the reward would have been 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70.\n\nThis exercise is provided to allow potential candidates to experience firsthand the day-to-day work of a Google SWE. There is no need to write code.\n\n[0] We use both digital logic and boolean algebra in our day-to-day work. A common way of describing boolean logic is through truth tables. A truth table lists all the possible input combinations and the corresponding output values.\n\nCreate a truth table to describe the logic required for the inputs described below.
