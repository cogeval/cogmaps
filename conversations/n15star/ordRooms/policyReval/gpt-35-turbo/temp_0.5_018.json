We can use a graph to visualize the connections between the rooms and their rewards. \n\nStarting from room 1, we can visit rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11, which are all connected to each other and have a total reward of 20 (5 + 5 + 5 + 5). Then we can visit room 14, which has a reward of 5. From there, we can go to room 11, which has already been visited, or we can go to room 8, which has a reward of 3. \n\nFrom room 8, we can visit room 5, which has a reward of 2, and then room 2, which has a reward of 1. This path has a total reward of 31 (20 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1).\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8, 5, 2. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8, 5, 2."
