Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can first go to room 7, then to room 10, and finally to room 13 where the chest with the reward of 50 is located. This path will yield a total reward of 50. \n\nAnother path we can take is to visit room 11 first, then room 14, and finally room 8 where the chest with the reward of 50 is located. This path will also yield a total reward of 50. \n\nVisiting room 15 will yield a reward of only 10, which is less than the reward in room 8. Therefore, we will not consider visiting room 15.\n\nSo, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1, 7, 10, 13, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 8"
