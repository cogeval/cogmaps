Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15 and there is another chest with a reward of 0 for visiting room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We first create a graph with 15 vertices representing the rooms and weighted edges representing the distances between the rooms. The weights will be the rewards for visiting the corresponding rooms. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1 to find the shortest path to all other rooms. \n\nUsing this method, we can see that the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is: \n\n1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, which is the reward for visiting room 8. Note that even though room 15 has a higher reward of 10, it is better to visit room 8 first since it has a higher reward and we can only collect the reward once. Room 10 is not visited since it has a reward of 0. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15"

Using the same method as before, we create a graph with weighted edges representing the rewards for visiting each room, and run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms. \n\nUsing this method, we can see that the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is: \n\n1, 7, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 100, which is the reward for visiting room 10. Note that this path is much shorter than the previous one since we only need to visit two rooms instead of six.
