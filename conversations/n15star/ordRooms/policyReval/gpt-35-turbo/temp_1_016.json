You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The shortest path to room 10 and 13 also have a distance of 1 and do not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 11 has a distance of 1 and does not yield any reward. \n\nThe shortest path to room 2 has a distance of 2 and does not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 4 has a distance of 2 and does not yield any reward. \n\nThe shortest path to room 3 has a distance of 3 and does not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 5 has a distance of 3 and does not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 6 has a distance of 3 and does not yield any reward.\n\nThe shortest path to room 8 has a distance of 4 and yields a reward of 50. The shortest path to room 9 has a distance of 4 and does not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 12 has a distance of 4 and yields a reward of 10. The shortest path to room 14 has a distance of 4 and does not yield any reward. The shortest path to room 15 has a distance of 4 and yields a reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 8\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 8"
