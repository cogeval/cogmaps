We can start by creating a matrix of size 15x15, where each element (i, j) represents the maximum reward that can be obtained by starting from room i and ending in room j. We can initialize the matrix with 0s and then use the given connections to fill in the rewards.\n\nHere is the matrix with the maximum rewards:\n\n|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 |  5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  0 |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  5 |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 |  5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |\n| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 |  0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |\n| 7 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |\n| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |\n| 10| 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 11| 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 12| 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |  0 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 13| 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 |  5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |\n| 14| 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |  5 |  5 |  5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |\n| 15| 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |  5 |  0 |  5 |  5 |  5 |  0 |\n\nAs we can see from the matrix, the path with the highest reward from room 1 to room 14 is: 1, 7, 11, 14. The total reward for this path is 20 (5 for visiting room 7, 5 for visiting room 11, and 10 for visiting room 14).\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 11, 14"
