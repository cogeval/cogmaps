Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Then, we can choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we start by initializing the distance of each room to infinity and the distance of room 1 to 0. Then, we explore all the neighboring rooms of room 1 and update their distances. We repeat this process until we have explored all rooms. Here are the final distances:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 2\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: 2\nRoom 6: 3\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 8: 2\nRoom 9: 3\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 2\nRoom 12: 4\nRoom 13: 2\nRoom 14: 3\nRoom 15: 2\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is to go from room 1 to room 8, collect the 50 reward, and then return to room 1. This path has a total distance of 2 and a total reward of 50. Here is the path in order: 1, 8, 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 8, 1"
