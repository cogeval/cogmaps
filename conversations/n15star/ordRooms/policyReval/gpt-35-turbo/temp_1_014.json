Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We will start by initializing the distances to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1, which we will set to 0. We will also keep track of the rewards associated with each room. Then, we will visit the adjacent rooms to room 1 and update their distances and rewards if they are less than the current values. We will continue this process, visiting the adjacent rooms with the smallest distances until we reach room 8 or room 15. Finally, we will list the rooms visited in order, starting from room 1.\n\nThe distances and rewards for each room are as follows:\n\nRoom 1: Distance = 0, Reward = 0\nRoom 2: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 3: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 4: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 5: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 6: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 7: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 8: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 50\nRoom 9: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 10: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 11: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 12: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 13: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 14: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 0\nRoom 15: Distance = Infinity, Reward = 10\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is as follows:\n\n1, 8\n\nAnswer: 1, 8"
