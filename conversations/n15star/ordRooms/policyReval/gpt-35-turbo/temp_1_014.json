Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set room 1 as the current room and create an empty list of visited rooms.\n3. For each room adjacent to the current room:\n   - If the sum of the current room's tentative distance and the reward for the adjacent room is greater than the adjacent room's tentative distance, update the adjacent room's tentative distance to the sum and set the current room as its predecessor.\n4. Mark the current room as visited and select the unvisited room with the largest tentative distance as the new current room. If all remaining unvisited rooms have infinite distance, stop.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the current room is room 14 or all rooms have been visited.\n6. If a path to room 14 has been found, backtrack from room 14 to room 1 using each room's predecessor until room 1 is reached.\n\nThe path from room 1 to room 14 that yields the most reward is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 14. The total reward is 5. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 14."
