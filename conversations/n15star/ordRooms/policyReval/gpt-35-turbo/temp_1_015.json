Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Applying this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from room 1 to all the other rooms, and then choose the path that leads to the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following distances and rewards for each room:\n- Room 1: distance 0, reward 0\n- Room 2: distance 1, reward 0\n- Room 3: distance 2, reward 0\n- Room 4: distance 1, reward 0\n- Room 5: distance 2, reward 0\n- Room 6: distance 3, reward 0\n- Room 7: distance 1, reward 0\n- Room 8: distance 2, reward 50\n- Room 9: distance 3, reward 0\n- Room 10: distance 2, reward 0\n- Room 11: distance 2, reward 0\n- Room 12: distance 4, reward 0\n- Room 13: distance 2, reward 0\n- Room 14: distance 3, reward 0\n- Room 15: distance 3, reward 10\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is 1-7-10-13-11-8 with a total distance of 4 and a total reward of 50. The shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is 1-7-10-13-15 with a total distance of 4 and a total reward of 10. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1-7-10-13-11-8.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,8"

However, this path does not yield the most reward since we have a higher reward of 50 in room 8.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is still 1-7-10-13-11-8 with a total distance of 4 and a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,8"
