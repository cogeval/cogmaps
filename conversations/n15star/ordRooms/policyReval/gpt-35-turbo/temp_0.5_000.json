Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room, and the previous room in the path.\n```\n| Room | Distance | Previous |\n|------|----------|----------|\n|  1   |    0     |   None   |\n|  2   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  3   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  4   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  5   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  6   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  7   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  8   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  9   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  10  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  11  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  12  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  13  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  14  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  15  |   inf    |   None   |\n```\n\n2. Set the distance for the directly connected rooms to their respective rewards (50 for room 8, 10 for room 15), and update their previous room to room 1.\n```\n| Room | Distance | Previous |\n|------|----------|----------|\n|  1   |    0     |   None   |\n|  2   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  3   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  4   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  5   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  6   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  7   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  8   |    50    |    1     |\n|  9   |   inf    |   None   |\n|  10  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  11  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  12  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  13  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  14  |   inf    |   None   |\n|  15  |    10    |    1     |\n```\n\n3. For each unvisited room, select the one with the smallest distance and mark it as visited. For each directly connected room that is unvisited, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge between them (1 in this case). If this distance is smaller than the previous distance for that room, update the distance and previous room in the table.\n```\n| Room | Distance | Previous |\n|------|----------|----------|\n|  1   |    0     |   None   |\n|  2   |    1     |    1     |\n|  3   |    1     |    1     |\n|  4   |    1     |    1     |\n|  5   |    2     |    2     |\n|  6   |    2     |    3     |\n|  7   |    1     |    1     |\n|  8   |    50    |    1     |\n|  9   |    3     |    6     |\n|  10  |    2     |    7     |\n|  11  |    3     |    2     |\n|  12  |    3     |    3     |\n|  13  |    2     |    7     |\n|  14  |    51    |    8     |\n|  15  |    10    |    1     |\n```\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until all rooms have been visited or there are no more reachable rooms.\n\n5. Trace back the path from room 8 or room 15 to room 1 by following the previous room in the table. The path that yields the most reward is the one that includes the room with the highest reward. In this case, the path that yields the most reward is 1 -> 8, with a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8"
