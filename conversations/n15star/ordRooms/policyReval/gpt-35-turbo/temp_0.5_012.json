Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Alternatively, we can reach room 15, which contains the chest with the reward of 10.\n\nTo determine which path yields the most reward, we can calculate the total reward for each path. The path from room 1 to room 8 has a total reward of 50, while the path from room 1 to room 15 has a total reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8"
