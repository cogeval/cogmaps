Then, I will traverse these paths and add up the rewards for each path. The path with the highest total reward is the one we want.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with all of the rooms as nodes and their connections as edges.\n2. Set all node distances to infinity except for room 1 which has a distance of zero.\n3. Initialize an empty list called \"visited\" to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Initialize a dictionary called \"rewards\" where each key is a node and its value is its reward (5 if it's room 14, otherwise 0).\n5. While there are still unvisited nodes:\n   - Find the node with minimum distance in \"distances\" that isn't in \"visited\". This will be our current node.\n   - Add this current node \"visited\".\n   - For each neighbor of this current node:\n      * Calculate a tentative distance by adding its weight (which is always 0) to its parent's distance plus its own reward from \"rewards\".\n      * If this tentative distance is less than its current recorded distance, update it in our distances dictionary.\n6. Once we have calculated all shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can traverse them starting at room 14 until we reach room 1 again while keeping track of rewards along each path.\n7. We choose the path with maximum total reward.\n\nAnswer: 14,11,7,4"
