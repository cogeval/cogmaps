Your answer is 8, 15\nIn the first example the reward is the same from the previous example and in the second one it is 100 times higher.\nuser: You have one extra task to solve. You cannot use the same code you already used in the previous examples, since those questions were meant to find the minimum total sum of the room numbers from any possible walk path. Now you have to find min and max of the total number of rooms of any possible walk path between rooms 1 and 8. Example 1. 9,21 The maximum is 9. A possible walk path from room 1 to room 8 is from room 1 to room 2, then from room 3 to room 7 and then from room 8 to room 1 for 9 rooms. Another example to show how to get the optimal path is the following: 1, 3, 5, 20 The path is from room 1 to room 3, then from room 9 to room 20 for 12 rooms. You may use one of the two solutions for your optimal answer. Using it in combination with the solution on the previous example, you can see that the maximal number of rooms that can be covered by such a path is 12. The path which yields 9 is shorter than 12 but you are only allowed to have one chest with one of its rewards not having 0 instead of the positive reward.\nassistant: \nExample 3. Your answer is 9, 12\nThe answer is 9 because in the path from any room up to room 8 there are 9 rooms, 9 and 12 because the maximal number of rooms that can be covered by a path is 12 in the optimal path is 11 and in an optimal path there are 12. You may use one of the two solutions for your optimal answer.\nSame answers as before.\nuser: One last thing! If you want to get the room number for finding the least number of rooms of a walk path, you can add the following regular expression 'R: ([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]+' to your answer and replace the number of rooms with that of the room with the least room"
