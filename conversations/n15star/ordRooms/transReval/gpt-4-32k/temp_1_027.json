We will start from room 1 and consider all possible paths.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can visit rooms 3, 7, 10, 13, or 11. From each of these rooms, we can visit the next connected rooms. We will choose the path that visits the maximum number of unique rooms.\n\n1. Room 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15\n2. Room 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13\n3. Room 1 -> 10 -> 13\n4. Room 1 -> 13\n5.
