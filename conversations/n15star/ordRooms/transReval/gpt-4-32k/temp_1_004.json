I will first list the connections between the rooms and identify possible paths:\n\n1. Room 1 is connected to rooms 3, 7, 10, 11, and 13.\n2. Room 3 is connected to rooms 1, 6, 9, and 12.\n3. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 10, and 13.\n4. Room 10 is connected to rooms 1, 7, 13, and 4.\n5. Room 13 is connected to rooms 1, 7, 10, and 4.\n6. Room 11 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n7. Room 2 is connected to rooms 11, 5, 8, and 14.\n8. Room 5 is connected to rooms 2, 8, 11, and 14.\n9. Room 8 is connected to rooms 2, 5, 11, 14, and 3.\n10. Room 14 is connected to rooms 2, 5, 8, 11, and 9.\n11. Room 3 is connected to rooms 1, 6, 9, 12, and 8.\n12. Room 6 is connected to rooms 3, 9, 12, and 15.\n13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 3, 6, 12, and 15.\n14. Room 12 is connected to rooms 3, 6, 9, 15, and 11.\n15. Room 15 is connected to rooms 6, 9, 12, and 4.\n\nBased on these connections, the path that yields the most reward would be:\n\n1. Start at room 1.\n2. Go to room 3 (connected to room 1).\n3. Go to room 6 (connected to room 3).\n4. Go to room 9 (connected to room 6).\n5. Go to room 12 (connected to room 9).\n6. Go to room 15 (connected to room 12).\n7. Go to room 4 (connected to room 15).\n8. Go to room 7 (connected to room 4).\n9. Go to room 10 (connected to room 7).\n10. Go to room 13 (connected to room 10).\n11. Go to room 11 (connected to room 1).\n12. Go to room 2 (connected to room 11).\n13. Go to room 5 (connected to room 2).\n14. Go to room 8 (connected to room 5).\n15. Go to room 14 (connected to room 8).\n\nSo, the most rewarding path would be:\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 4, 7, 10, 13, 11, 2, 5, 8, 14"
