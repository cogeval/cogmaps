Since room 1 is connected to room 3, we can consider these connections as well.\n3. Room 7 is connected to rooms 4, 10, and 13.\n4. Room 10 is connected to rooms 4, 7, and 13.\n5. Room 13 is connected to rooms 4, 7, and 10.\n6. Room 11 is connected to rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n7. Room 8 is connected to rooms 5, 11, 14, and 3.\n\nWe can now find the path with the most reward:\n\n1. Start in Room 1.\n2. Move to Room 3 (connecting rooms 1 and 3).\n3. Move to Room 6.\n4. Move to Room 9.\n5. Move to Room 12.\n6. Move to Room 15.\n7. Move to Room 9.\n8. Move to Room 6.\n9. Move to Room 3.\n10. Move to Room 8.\n11. Move to Room 5.\n12. Move to Room 2.\n13.
