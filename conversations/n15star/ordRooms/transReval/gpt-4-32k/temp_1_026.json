If we continue from room 4, we have options: room 7, room 10, and room 13.\n\nTo maximize the number of unique rooms visited, we can take the following path:\n\n1 (starting room) -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15 -> 4 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 1 (return to the starting point, completing the loop)\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 4, 7, 10, 13"
