Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

You can visit a room number only after you have visited all the rooms connecting to it at most one time. For example, suppose there are two rooms connecting to room 1. If both of these rooms connect to room 2, then we could visit room 2 twice, which is a violation of your rule.\nRoom 1, Room 2, Room 3, Room 4, Room 5, Room 6, Room 7, Room 8, Room 9, Room 10, Room 11, Room 12, Room 13, Room 14, Room 15\nSolution: 50\nExplanation: By checking from the first room until the second room you find that 8 is connected to 5 and 10 and 50 is the least number in between.\nImagine 5 people from 5 different nationalities with different ages in the world. One person is 30 years old. One person is from Asia. Another person is 40. Another is from South East Asia. Another is European. Another is from Europe. The person with least age is from South East Asia. You are asked to find the nationality of that person. Remember, you can only check one nationality at a time and you must give accurate answer. Note that you can choose and check one nationality only once. Starting from the person that has the least age, please choose a nationality and submit the name of the nationality and an English description for that person (for example: Indian or Malaysian). Do not submit a complete sentence; a person that has a nationality is not described by a complete sentence. For instance, in the case where the person is from South East Asia, you should submit 'Indian' or 'Malaysian' and then no space should appear after these two words. For a person from Europe, you should submit 'French' or 'Italian' and then no space should appear after these two words. For a person from the United States of America, you should submit 'American' or 'American' and then no space should appear after these two words. For a person at least 40, you should submit 'Old' and then no space should appear after these two words"
