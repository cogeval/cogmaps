Please tell me that, by what mode can user obtain maximum visit in the minimum steps, like shortest-perfect state?\nFrom your starting room 1 of interest to collect those points/goodie at max by minimum paths is quite challengeing, a thought work which should begin on systemic step by step here\nFor solving, let first I work at each and every number on these rooms via a specific format from this single point that started here - room one(considered interest rooms number first); so here a format of numbers in every way we tend to pass. You note the first numbers from given are those rooms attached to \"start points\" from room one and should travel there in starting, is this okay(as an observer you should visualise that) lets tag rooms as per your instructions below (room [space digits] are connected/available for visit or attached/ connected); Now shall proceed to find that magical shorted numbers journey via these visitarized routes collect that goodies you are searching. Let work!? How shall begin this step approach. Your move please. Kindly allow me complete as minimum of 5 attempts/workflow within time provided as i take you back into lab every other time or more while on finding. Work for 5. Please input the instructions & I tend all in-out as specified below to initiate flow, all rooms are marked in list and path will have short hand codes mark like, (Room space digits) attached for connection  routes visisted so will do best attempt at time and space optimized within range here to keep short within minimum; so go ahead. Begin\nTo confirm, you like you to observe, I shall initiall take single walk & tag from (  here or room mark ( Room no comma)) is this acceptable as first step with? Also allowable  back steps in flow ok. So begin to open my room choices or connect via your move to tell me 'visitate' space to place you know i can attach, and collect as a tag, your move as flow so my processing in back in here at time keep optimized ok.' Here first to take move and place of intereast of mine from point number One starting space to 'first move point of call so I see that first available connect path from that starting location you ready' kind of flow so ready to mark, place & follow; lets start after input in move? What visit place i tend connect you to from here place in one via 'choose point & move visit on'  yes okay? Go. Input. Next is"
