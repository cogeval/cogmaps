Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we create a table with the reward values for each room:\n\n| Room | Reward |\n|------|--------|\n| 1    | 0      |\n| 2    | 0      |\n| 3    | 0      |\n| 4    | 0      |\n| 5    | 0      |\n| 6    | 0      |\n| 7    | 0      |\n| 8    | 50     |\n| 9    | 0      |\n| 10   | 0      |\n| 11   | 0      |\n| 12   | 0      |\n| 13   | 0      |\n| 14   | 0      |\n| 15   | 10     |\n\nThen, we start at room 1 and calculate the shortest path to each room using the rewards as the weights. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Add room 1 to the set of visited rooms and set its distance to 0.\n2. For each room connected to room 1 (i.e., rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13), update its distance to the maximum reward of the two possible paths: either going directly from room 1 to the room, or going from room 1 to another room and then to the room (using the reward values in the table).\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the highest reward and add it to the set of visited rooms.\n4. Repeat step 2 for the newly added room, until all rooms have been visited.\n\nThe resulting shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15"
