Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The reward for visiting Rooms 7, 10, and 13 is not the highest, so we can discard them. The reward for visiting Room 11 is also not the highest, so we can discard it as well.\n\nNext, we can move to Room 8, which has the highest reward of 50. From Room 1, we can reach Room 8 through Room 11. However, we can also reach Room 8 through Room 2, which has another path to Room 11. This means we have two possible paths to reach Room 8. \n\nFrom Room 8, we can move to Room 14, which has no other paths to higher reward rooms. From Room 14, we can reach Room 11, which has no other paths to higher reward rooms.\n\nFinally, from Room 11, we can reach Room 15, which has a reward of 10. Since we have already collected the highest reward, we do not need to visit Room 15.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from Room 1 is: \n1, 11, 8, 14\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8, 14"

However, the reward for visiting Room 8 is still the highest, and it is connected to Room 12.\n\nTo reach Room 12, we need to go through Room 7 or Room 13, which have a lower reward. Therefore, we can first move to Room 4, which is now connected to Room 11.
