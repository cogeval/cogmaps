Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The rewards can be assigned as weights to the edges. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path with the maximum reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm with the given graph, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is 1-10-13-7-4-10-13-11-14-8, with a reward of 50. The shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is 1-10-13-7-4-15, with a reward of 10.\n\nSince the reward for visiting room 8 is greater, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is 1-10-13-7-4-10-13-11-14-8.\n\nAnswer: 1,10,13,7,4,10,13,11,14,8"
