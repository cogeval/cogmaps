            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward from Room 1, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to 0 for Room 1 and to infinity (\u221e) for all other rooms.\n2. Set Room 1 as the current room and create a set of unvisited rooms.\n3. For the current room, calculate the tentative distance value for each of its neighboring rooms. The tentative distance is the sum of the current room's distance and the distance to the neighbor.\n4. When we have finished considering all the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until we visit all rooms or there are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find the path with the highest reward, which means the path with the highest sum of rewards for each room. Let's assume that each room has a reward value that is equal to its room number. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the following tentative distances for each room:\nRoom 1: 0 (start)\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 2: \u221e\nRoom 4: \u221e\nRoom 5: \u221e\nRoom 6: \u221e\nRoom 7: \u221e\nRoom 8: \u221e\nRoom 9: \u221e\nRoom 10: \u221e\nRoom 11: \u221e\nRoom 12: \u221e\nRoom 13: \u221e\nRoom 14: \u221e\nRoom 15: \u221e\n\nNext, we visit the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is Room 3. From there, we calculate the tentative distances for its neighboring rooms:\nRoom 1: 0 (start)\nRoom 3: 1 (visited)\nRoom 2: 4 (1+3)\nRoom 6: 15 (1+14)\nRoom 9: 16 (1+15)\nRoom 12: 17 (1+16)\nRoom 8: \u221e\nRoom 10: \u221e\nRoom 13: \u221e\nRoom 15: \u221e\nRoom 4: \u221e\nRoom 5: \u221e\nRoom 7: \u221e\nRoom 11: \u221e\nRoom 14: \u221e\n\nThe next unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance is Room 2.
