Rooms 1, 7, 10, 13 - Total reward: 4\n3. Rooms 1, 7, 4, 15 - Total reward: 4\n4. Rooms 1, 7, 10, 11, 14 - Total reward: 4\n5. Rooms 1, 7, 11, 14 - Total reward: 3\n6. Rooms 1, 7, 4, 10, 13 - Total reward: 3\n7. Rooms 1, 7, 11, 8, 14 - Total reward: 3\n8. Rooms 1, 7, 10 - Total reward: 2\n9. Rooms 1, 7, 13 - Total reward: 2\n10. Rooms 1, 7, 4 - Total reward: 2\n11.
