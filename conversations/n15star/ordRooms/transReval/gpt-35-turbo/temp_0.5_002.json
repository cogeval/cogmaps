Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For the current room, calculate the tentative distance to all its neighboring rooms (rooms 3, 7, 10, 11, and 13) as 1.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. Set the next current room to the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance (room 3).\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all rooms have been visited.\n8. The path with the most reward will be the one with the smallest total distance from room 1 to any of the rooms that yield a reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that the path with the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 3, 9, 12, 15. \n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 9, 12, 15."
