Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we have the following shortest paths and rewards:\n\n- Room 1: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 7: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 10: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 13: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 11: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 5: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 8: 50 reward (chest)\n- Room 2: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 6: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 9: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 12: 10 reward (chest)\n- Room 15: 10 reward (chest)\n- Room 4: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 14: 0 reward (no chests)\n- Room 3: 0 reward (no chests)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is the path to room 8, which has a reward of 50.
