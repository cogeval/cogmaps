From Room 1, we can reach Room 7, Room 10, and Room 13. Each of these rooms is connected to other rooms that offer different rewards. The paths and their corresponding rewards are:\n\n- Room 1 -> Room 7 -> Room 10 -> Room 13: Reward 15 + 10 + 15 = 40\n- Room 1 -> Room 7 -> Room 4 -> Room 13: Reward 15 + 5 + 15 = 35\n- Room 1 -> Room 7 -> Room 10 -> Room 4 -> Room 13: Reward 15 + 10 + 5 + 15 = 45\n- Room 1 -> Room 7 -> Room 13: Reward 15 + 15 = 30\n- Room 1 -> Room 10 -> Room 7 -> Room 13: Reward 10 + 15 + 15 = 40\n- Room 1 -> Room 10 -> Room 13: Reward 10 + 15 = 25\n- Room 1 -> Room 13: Reward 15\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is Room 1 -> Room 7 -> Room 10 -> Room 4 -> Room 13 with a total reward of 45. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 4, 13."
