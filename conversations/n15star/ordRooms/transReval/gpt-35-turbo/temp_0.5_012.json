Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a graph with the given connections between rooms.\n2. Assign a weight of 0 to all edges except the ones leading to the reward chests, which have weights of 50 and 10.\n3. Run Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1 to find the shortest path to all other rooms.\n4. Check which of the shortest paths leads to a reward chest with the highest value.\n5. Output the path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward chest.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following shortest paths from room 1 to each room:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 100\nRoom 3: 150\nRoom 4: 50\nRoom 5: 100\nRoom 6: 150\nRoom 7: 50\nRoom 8: 50\nRoom 9: 200\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 100\nRoom 12: 200\nRoom 13: 50\nRoom 14: 100\nRoom 15: 60\n\nThe shortest path to room 8 is through rooms 1, 10, 13, 7, and 8, with a total weight of 150 and a reward of 50.
