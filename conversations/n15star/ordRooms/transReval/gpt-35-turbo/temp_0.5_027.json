            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. First, we will create a table with the distances from room 1 to every other room and the rewards in each room:\n\n| Room | Distance from 1 | Reward |\n|------|----------------|--------|\n| 1    | 0              | 0      |\n| 2    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 3    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 4    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 5    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 6    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 7    | 1              | 0      |\n| 8    | 2              | 50     |\n| 9    | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 10   | 1              | 0      |\n| 11   | 1              | 0      |\n| 12   | Infinity       | 0      |\n| 13   | 1              | 0      |\n| 14   | 2              | 0      |\n| 15   | 2              | 10     |\n\nNext, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to each room, taking into account the rewards. Starting from room 1, we will consider the distances and rewards of all the adjacent rooms and update the table accordingly. We will repeat this process until we have visited all the rooms or until we reach room 8 or room 15.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Mark the distance from room 1 to room 1 as 0 and the reward as 0.\n2. For all the other rooms, mark the distance as Infinity and the reward as 0.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For each adjacent room, update the distance and reward in the table if it is shorter and more rewarding to go through the current room.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. Set the next current room to the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 1.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until we reach room 8 or room 15 or we have visited all the rooms.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following table:\n\n| Room | Distance from 1 | Reward | Visited? |\n|------|----------------|--------|----------|\n| 1    | 0              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 2    | 2              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 3    | 3              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 4    | 2              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 5    | 3              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 6    | 4              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 7    | 1              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 8    | 2              | 50     | Yes      |\n| 9    | 4              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 10   | 1              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 11   | 1              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 12   | 4              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 13   | 1              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 14   | 2              | 0      | Yes      |\n| 15   | 2              | 10     | Yes      |\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is to go to room 7, then to room 8, and finally to room 15, for a total reward of 50. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,7,8,15"
