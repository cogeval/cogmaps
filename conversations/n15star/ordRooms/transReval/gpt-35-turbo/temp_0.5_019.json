Starting from room 1, we can take the following paths:\n\n1. Room 7 (reward 10) -> Room 10 (reward 5) -> Room 13 (reward 7) -> Room 11 (reward 8) -> Room 14 (reward 3) -> Room 8 (reward 2) -> Total reward: 35\n2. Room 7 (reward 10) -> Room 10 (reward 5) -> Room 13 (reward 7) -> Room 11 (reward 8) -> Room 14 (reward 3) -> Total reward: 33\n3. Room 7 (reward 10) -> Room 10 (reward 5) -> Room 13 (reward 7) -> Room 11 (reward 8) -> Total reward: 30\n4. Room 7 (reward 10) -> Room 10 (reward 5) -> Room 13 (reward 7) -> Total reward: 22\n5. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 6 (reward 4) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Room 12 (reward 1) -> Room 15 (reward 10) -> Total reward: 30\n6. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 6 (reward 4) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Room 12 (reward 1) -> Total reward: 20\n7. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 6 (reward 4) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Total reward: 19\n8. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Room 12 (reward 1) -> Room 15 (reward 10) -> Total reward: 26\n9. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Room 12 (reward 1) -> Total reward: 16\n10. Room 3 (reward 6) -> Room 9 (reward 9) -> Total reward: 15\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1,7,10,13,11,14 with a total reward of 35.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,14"
