The reward of a path is the sum of the rewards of all the rooms in the path. Assuming that the reward of each room is equal to its number, the path with the highest reward will be the one with the highest sum. \n\nStarting from room 1, the possible paths are:\n1. 1-7-10-13-11-14-8-5-2-6-9-12-15 (total reward = 96)\n2. 1-7-10-13-11-14-8-5-2-6-9-12 (total reward = 93)\n3. 1-7-10-13-11-14-8-5-2-6-9 (total reward = 88)\n4. 1-7-10-13-11-14-8-5-2 (total reward = 73)\n5. 1-7-10-13-11-14-8 (total reward = 50)\n6. 1-3-6-9-12-15 (total reward = 46)\n7. 1-3-9-12-15 (total reward = 40)\n8. 1-3-12-15 (total reward = 31)\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8, 5, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15 \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 8, 5, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15"
