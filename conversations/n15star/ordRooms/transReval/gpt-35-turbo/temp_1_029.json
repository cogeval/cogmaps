Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will start by setting the distance to room 1 to 0 and the distances to all other rooms to infinity. Then, we will visit each room and update the distances to its neighbors based on the rewards of the chests in those rooms. We will also keep track of the previous room on the shortest path to each room. Finally, we will backtrack from room 8 and room 15 to room 1 to find the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity and the distance to room 1 to 0.\n   - distance = {1: 0, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: inf, 11: inf, 12: inf, 13: inf, 14: inf, 15: inf}\n2. Initialize an empty set called visited.\n   - visited = set()\n3. Initialize an empty dictionary called previous.\n   - previous = {}\n4. While there are unvisited rooms:\n   a. Choose the room with the shortest distance from the start node. Call this room \"current\".\n   b. For each neighbor of \"current\":\n      i. If the distance to the neighbor through \"current\" is less than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance to the neighbor and set the previous room to \"current\".\n   c. Mark \"current\" as visited.\n5. Backtrack from room 8 and room 15 to room 1 to find the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15\n\nAnswer: 1,\\s*7,\\s*10,\\s*13,\\s*4,\\s*15"
