Since the task does not provide this information, we cannot provide a specific answer. However, we can provide a general approach to solve the problem. \n\nOne way to find the path that yields the most reward is to use a graph search algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm. We can represent the castle as a graph, where each room is a node and the connections between rooms are edges. The rewards associated with each room can be represented as edge weights. \n\nStarting from room 1, we can use the graph search algorithm to find the shortest path to room 3, taking into account the rewards associated with each room. Once we reach room 3, we can continue the search to find the path that yields the most reward, taking into account the connections between rooms and the rewards associated with each room. \n\nAnswer: This task cannot be answered without information about the rewards associated with each room."
