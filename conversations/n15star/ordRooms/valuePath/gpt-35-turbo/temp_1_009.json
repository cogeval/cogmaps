Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step by step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to all rooms except room 1, which will have a distance of 1000 (since we want to minimize the distance and 1000 is larger than the maximum possible distance).\n\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited and create a set of unvisited rooms.\n\n3. Set the current room as room 1 and current distance as 0.\n\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances based on the rewards available in those rooms. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance of the neighboring room, update the neighboring room's distance.\n\n5. When we have considered all the neighboring rooms, mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. \n\n6. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until we reach the target room (room 8 or room 15).\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest paths and rewards for each target room:\n\n- Room 8: 1-7-8 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-10-13-7-8 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-10-13-11-14-8 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-15-6-9-8 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-15-12-9-8 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-10-7-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-13-11-14-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-13-10-1-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-13-11-2-5-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-13-11-2-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-13-11-2-14-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-10-1-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-10-13-2-5-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-10-13-2-8 (reward: 50), 1-7-4-10-13-2-14-8 (reward: 50)\n- Room 15: 1-7-4-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-10-13-15 (reward: 10), 1-7-4-13-10-15 (reward: 10), 1-7-4-13-11-2-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-11-14-8-2-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-11-14-2-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-11-2-5-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-11-2-8-14-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-10-1-8-14-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-10-13-2-8-14-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-10-1-8-14-15 (reward: 0), 1-7-4-13-10-2-8-14-15 (reward: 0)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is \"1-7-4-13-10-7-8\" with a reward of 50. \n\nAnswer: 1,7,4,13,10,7,8"
