Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 8 and room 15 respectively, and then choose the path with the highest reward. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room and the previous room in the path. We start by initializing the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 1, which we set to 0. Then, we visit the neighbors of room 1, update their distances if they are shorter than the current distance, and add them to a priority queue. We continue to visit the neighbors in the priority queue until we reach room 8 and room 15.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is: 1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 3 -> 8, with a reward of 50.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is: 1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15, with a reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the path with the highest reward is the first one, 1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 3 -> 8, which yields a total reward of 50. \n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9, 3, 8."
