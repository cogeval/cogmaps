Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we create a graph where each room is a node and the edges represent the connections between rooms. We also assign the rewards to the corresponding nodes. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1, keeping track of the total reward at each node and the previous node in the shortest path.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15. This path has a total reward of 50 (from room 8) and is the shortest path that includes the chest with the highest reward, 50. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15"
