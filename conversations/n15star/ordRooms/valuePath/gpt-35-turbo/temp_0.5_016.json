Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a table with the following columns: \"Room\", \"Visited\", \"Distance\", \"Previous\", and \"Reward\". For each room, set \"Visited\" to false, \"Distance\" to infinity, \"Previous\" to null, and \"Reward\" to 0.\n\n2. Set the \"Distance\" of room 1 to 0.\n\n3. While there are unvisited rooms, do the following:\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest \"Distance\" and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each neighboring room that is unvisited, calculate the distance from the current room to that room. If the distance is less than the current \"Distance\" of the neighboring room, update its \"Distance\" to the new value, and set its \"Previous\" to the current room.\n\n6. If a room with a chest is visited, update its \"Reward\" to the value of the chest.\n\n7. Once all rooms have been visited, follow the \"Previous\" links from room 8 and room 15 to room 1 to determine the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following:\n\nRoom | Visited | Distance | Previous | Reward\n-----|---------|----------|----------|-------\n  1  |  true   |    0     |   null   |   0\n  7  |  true   |    1     |    1     |   0\n 10  |  true   |    1     |    1     |   0\n 13  |  true   |    1     |    1     |   10\n 11  |  true   |    1     |    1     |   0\n  8  |  true   |    2     |    11    |  50\n 14  |  true   |    2     |    11    |   0\n  5  |  true   |    2     |    11    |   0\n  2  |  true   |    3     |    5     |   0\n  6  |  true   |    3     |    5     |   0\n  9  |  true   |    3     |    6     |   0\n 12  |  true   |    3     |    9     |  10\n 15  |  true   |    4     |    12    |  10\n  4  |  false  |   inf    |   null   |   0\n-----\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 11, 8\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8"
