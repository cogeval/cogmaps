Out of these, room 7 is on the shortest path and yields no reward. Rooms 10 and 13 are connected to room 7, and also yield no reward. Room 11 is also connected to room 7, but yields no reward either. \n\nFrom room 8, we can go to room 14, which is the only room connected to it. Room 14 also yields no reward. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, and 9, which yields a reward of 0. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9"
