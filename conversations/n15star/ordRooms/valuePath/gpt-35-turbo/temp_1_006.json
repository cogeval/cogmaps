Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we will visit the adjacent rooms one by one and calculate the reward for each possible path. The path with the highest reward will be our answer. Here are the steps:\n\n1. We start from room 1 and visit its adjacent rooms: room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11.\n2. We visit room 7. From there, we can visit room 4, room 10, room 13, and back to room 1. None of these rooms have a chest with a reward, so we don't collect anything. We return to room 1.\n3. We visit room 10. From there, we can visit room 7, room 13, and room 4. We visit room 7 and collect the reward of 10 from the chest. We now have a total reward of 10. We continue to room 1.\n4. We visit room 13. From there, we can visit room 10, room 7, and room 4. We visit room 10 and collect the reward of 50 from the chest. We now have a total reward of 50. We continue to room 1.\n5. We visit room 11. From there, we can visit room 1, room 14, and room 8. We visit room 8 and collect the reward of 50 from the chest. We now have a total reward of 50. We continue to room 1.\n\nThe path that yields the most reward while starting from room 1 is: 1, 10, 7. The total reward is 10. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:  Answer: 1, 10, 7"
