Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of zero to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms. Set all rewards to zero.\n\n2. Mark room 1 as visited.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13), calculate the distance to that room (1 + distance to room 1) and the reward for visiting that room. Update the distance and reward for each neighboring room if the new values are better than the old values.\n\n4. Choose the neighboring room with the highest reward and mark it as the target room.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the target room is either room 8 or room 15.\n\n6. Backtrack from the target room to room 1 by choosing the neighbor with the shortest distance at each step. Record each visited room.\n\n7. Return the recorded room numbers, separated by commas, including room 1.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15."
