Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity except for room 1, which is 0. Also, initialize the maximum reward to all rooms as 0.\n2. Add room 1 to the priority queue.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Pop the room with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   2. For each neighboring room, calculate the distance to that room as the distance to the current room plus 1 (since all rooms are connected by a single edge). If the new distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and the maximum reward for that room.\n   3. If the neighboring room has not been visited yet, add it to the priority queue.\n4. The shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 1 and ends at either room 8 or room 15, depending on which chest to collect. The maximum reward for each room is as follows:\n   - Room 8: 50\n   - Room 15: 10\n5. To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can backtrack from the destination room (either room 8 or room 15) to room 1 using the maximum reward for each room. Here is the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1:\n   1. Room 1 (reward: 0)\n   2. Room 7 (reward: 0)\n   3. Room 10 (reward: 0)\n   4. Room 13 (reward: 0)\n   5. Room 15 (reward: 10)\n   \nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15."
