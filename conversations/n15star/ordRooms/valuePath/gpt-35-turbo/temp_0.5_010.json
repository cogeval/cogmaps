Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity and set the distance to room 1 to 0. Set all rewards to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add room 1 with distance 0 and reward 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the room with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   b. For each neighboring room that has not been visited, calculate the distance and reward if we were to visit it from the current room. If the distance is shorter than the current distance, update the distance and reward and add the room to the queue.\n4. The shortest path that yields the most reward is the path with the highest reward among the shortest paths to each of the target rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 1 and goes to room 7, then to room 10, and finally to room 13, with a reward of 0. Answer: 1, 7, 10, 13."
