Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can reach room 7, 10, 11, and 13, all of which do not have any rewards. From there, we can reach room 8, which has a reward of 50, and room 14, which has no rewards. We can then backtrack to room 2, which has no rewards, and then reach room 5, which also has no rewards. From there, we can reach room 11, which we have already visited, and room 14, which we have also visited. We can then backtrack to room 2, and then reach room 8, which we have already visited. We can then backtrack to room 1 and reach room 10, which has no rewards, and then reach room 13, which also has no rewards. Finally, we can reach room 4, which has no rewards, and then reach room 15, which has a reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 8, 2, 5, 11, 14, 4, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 8, 2, 5, 11, 14, 4, 15."
