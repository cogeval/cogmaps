Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which has distance 0. We also initialize a visited set as empty.\n\n1. We visit room 1 and update the distances to its neighbors: room 7, room 10, room 11, and room 13. Their distances are respectively 0+0, 0+0, 0+0, and 0+0, which are all less than infinity. We mark room 1 as visited.\n\n2. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 7 with distance 0. We update the distances to its neighbors: room 10 and room 13. Their distances are respectively 0+0 and infinity, which are both less than infinity.\n\n3. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 10 with distance 0. We update the distances to its neighbor: room 13. Its distance is 0+0, which is less than infinity.\n\n4. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 13 with distance 0. We update the distance to its neighbor: room 4. Its distance is 0+0, which is less than infinity.\n\n5. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 4 with distance 0. We update the distances to its neighbors: room 7, room 10, and room 15. Their distances are respectively 0+0, 0+0, and 0+10, which are all less than infinity.\n\n6. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 15 with distance 10. We have reached one of the chests with a reward, so we stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15. The total reward collected is 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15."
