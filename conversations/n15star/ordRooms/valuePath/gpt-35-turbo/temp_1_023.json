Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Based on the given connections and rewards, the path that yields the maximum reward is as follows:\n\n1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15\n\nThe total reward obtained is 50, which comes from visiting room 8. The shortest path that yields the most reward starts at room 1, then goes to room 10, then room 13, then room 7, then room 4, and finally room 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 1, 10, 13, 7, 4, 15."
