The path with the highest reward obtained will be the answer.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can visit the following rooms in order:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 10 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 10 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\n1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 10 -> 11 -> 14 -> 5 -> 8 (total reward: 20)\n\nTherefore, any of the above paths can be taken from room 1 to get the maximum reward of 20. \n\nAnswer: 7,10,13,11,14,8 (or any of the above paths with a total reward of 20)"
