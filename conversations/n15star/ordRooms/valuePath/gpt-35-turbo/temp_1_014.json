Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to use Dijkstra's Algorithm. We start by creating a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room and the maximum reward collected so far. \n\n| Room | Shortest Distance | Max Reward |\n|------|------------------|------------|\n|  1   |        0         |     0      |\n|  2   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  3   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  4   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  5   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  6   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  7   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  8   |       Inf        |     50     |\n|  9   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  10  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  11  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  12  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  13  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  14  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  15  |       Inf        |     10     |\n\nNext, we set the shortest distance for room 1 to be 0 and the maximum reward to be 0. We then consider the rooms adjacent to room 1, which are rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13. The shortest path to these rooms has a distance of 1 and there is no reward. We update their respective rows in the table accordingly. \n\n| Room | Shortest Distance | Max Reward |\n|------|------------------|------------|\n|  1   |        0         |     0      |\n|  2   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  3   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  4   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  5   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  6   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  7   |        1         |      0     |\n|  8   |       Inf        |     50     |\n|  9   |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  10  |        1         |      0     |\n|  11  |        1         |      0     |\n|  12  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  13  |        1         |      0     |\n|  14  |       Inf        |    -50     |\n|  15  |       Inf        |     10     |\n\nWe continue to update the table for all the rooms until we reach room 8 and 15. The shortest path to room 8 has a distance of 2 and a maximum reward of 50. The shortest path to room 15 has a distance of 3 and a maximum reward of 10. \n\n| Room | Shortest Distance | Max Reward |\n|------|------------------|------------|\n|  1   |        0         |     0      |\n|  2   |        3         |      0     |\n|  3   |        3         |      0     |\n|  4   |        2         |      0     |\n|  5   |        4         |      0     |\n|  6   |        4         |      0     |\n|  7   |        1         |      0     |\n|  8   |        2         |     50     |\n|  9   |        4         |      0     |\n|  10  |        1         |      0     |\n|  11  |        2         |      0     |\n|  12  |        4         |      0     |\n|  13  |        1         |      0     |\n|  14  |        3         |      0     |\n|  15  |        3         |     10     |\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13"
