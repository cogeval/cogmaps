Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

You have two options for your system, depending on whether you want it to learn using examples or without examples. Using examples will cause your system to get some answers right and some answers wrong. You will then be able to feed the correct answers into your system and feed the incorrect answers into the machine. This can be done over and over again until your system is close to 100% accuracy. This procedure is called supervised learning because you are providing the answers that the AI is looking for. For example, you could train your system to identify a tree and send the resulting tree image into the system. Without examples you have to figure out how the system works to know whether it is correct or not. You will not be able to use supervision to improve performance.\nThe system that uses supervised learning to learn from examples is called ______ machine.\na) _______\nAnswer: (a) supervised machine\nFor problems that do not have a set of correct answers, you do not need to create a training data set, because the program is responsible for creating the 'right answer.'
