Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

I first identified all of the rooms that are connected to room 1. These are rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11.\n2. I then calculated the total reward that can be obtained by visiting each of these rooms and all of the rooms that are connected to it. The results are as follows:\n\nRoom | Total Reward\n-------|------------\n7 | 10\n10 | 20\n13 | 30\n11 | 10\n\n3. I then chose the room with the highest total reward, which is room 8.\n4. To reach room 8 from room 1, I would follow the path:\n\n```\n1, 7, 8\n```\n\nThis path has a length of 2 and a total reward of 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the regular expression is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1,8\n```"
