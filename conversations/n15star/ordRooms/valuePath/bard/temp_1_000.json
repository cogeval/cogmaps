Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

I identified all of the rooms that are connected to room 1. These are rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11.\n2. I calculated the total reward that can be obtained by visiting each of these rooms. The room with the highest total reward is room 8.\n3. I followed the path from room 1 to room 8. This path has a length of 2.\n4. I output the regular expression for the answer. The regular expression is `Answer: 1,8`.\n\nDo you have any other questions?"
