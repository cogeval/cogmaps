You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, I will explore all possible paths to each connected room using depth-first search (DFS) and keep track of the total rewards obtained in each path. Since we can only teleport once, I will mark any visited rooms as \"teleported\" to prevent revisiting them.\n\nThe DFS algorithm will terminate when there are no more unvisited connected rooms or all remaining rooms have been teleported to. The path with the highest total reward will be returned.\n\nUsing this method, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,15"
