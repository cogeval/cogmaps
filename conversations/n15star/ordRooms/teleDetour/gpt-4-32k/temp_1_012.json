Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Based on the connections, the best path would be to teleport to a room in Group 2 or Group 4, as they share connections with the largest number of other rooms.\n\nFor example, teleporting to room 7 (Group 4) would give you access to Groups 1 and 7, while teleporting to room 2 (Group 2) would give you access to Groups 2 and 5.\n\nLet's assume that the reward is equal for each group. The best path would be to choose the group with the most connections, in this case, Group 4:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
