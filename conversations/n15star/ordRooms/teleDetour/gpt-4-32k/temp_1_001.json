We can select paths 1, 5, and 9, respectively.\n\nComparing the number of rooms reached in each path, we find that paths 1, 5, and 9 yield the most reward as they connect to four other rooms.\n\nSo, there are three paths that yield the most reward:\nPath 1: 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\nPath 5: 1, 10, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\nPath 9: 1, 13, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 1, 10, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 1, 13, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
