You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Each set of rooms represents a connection between rooms, and we can only teleport once.\n\n1. Rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, 11: 5 rewards\n2. Rooms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14: 5 rewards\n3. Rooms 3, 6, 9, 12, 8: 5 rewards\n4. Rooms 4, 7, 10, 13, 15: 5 rewards\n5. Rooms 5, 8, 11, 14: 4 rewards\n6. Rooms 6, 9, 12, 15: 4 rewards\n7. Rooms 7, 10, 13: 3 rewards\n8. Room 8, 14: 2 rewards\n9. Rooms 9, 12, 15: 3 rewards\n10. Rooms 10, 13: 2 rewards\n11. Rooms 11, 14: 2 rewards\n12. Rooms 12, 15: 2 rewards\n\nThe first four sets of rooms yield the most rewards (5 each). However, we are in room 1 and cannot connect to room 11, which excludes the first set. Therefore, we must choose between sets 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFrom room 1, we can teleport to any of the rooms in those sets. So, the path with the most rewards is:\n\n1. Teleport to room 2\n2. Visit rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14 in any order\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
