Choose room 2 as it has a significant number of connections.\nStep 3: From room 2, move to connected rooms in the following order: room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14.\nStep 4: Since you can only teleport once and you have already used it, you cannot visit any more rooms beyond room 14.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
