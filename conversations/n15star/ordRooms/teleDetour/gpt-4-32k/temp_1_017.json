You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Room 3 is connected to rooms 6, 9, and 12.\n4. Room 4 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n5. Room 5 is connected to rooms 8, 11, and 14.\n6. Room 6 is connected to rooms 9, 12, and 15.\n7. Room 7 is connected to rooms 10 and 13.\n8. Room 8 is connected to room 14.\n9. Room 9 is connected to rooms 12 and 15.\n10. Room 10 is connected to room 13.\n11. Room 11 is connected to room 14.\n12. Room 12 is connected to room 15.\n\nNow, since we can teleport to any room from room 1, we should choose a room that has the most connections to other rooms, as it will yield the most reward. Let's list the number of connections for each room:\n\n1. Room 2: 4 connections\n2. Room 3: 3 connections\n3. Room 4: 4 connections\n4. Room 5: 3 connections\n5. Room 6: 3 connections\n6. Room 7: 2 connections\n7. Room 8: 1 connection\n8. Room 9: 2 connections\n9. Room 10: 1 connection\n10. Room 11: 1 connection\n11. Room 12: 1 connection\n12. Room 13: 0 connections\n13. Room 14: 0 connections\n14. Room 15: 0 connections\n\nFrom this analysis, the rooms with the most connections are rooms 2 and 4, each with 4 connections. Since room 1 does not connect to room 11, we should choose room 2, as it has connections to rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14. So, the path that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
