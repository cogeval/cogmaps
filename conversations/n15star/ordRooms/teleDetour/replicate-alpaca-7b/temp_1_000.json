Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

For full path, 1-Room 1 (nothing), 1 Room 7,Room 11or20 (50), 1 Room 13 (50), Room11- Room8 (also50). Thus the most reward is gained from the path starting Room 1 \u2192Room7-> Room13-> Room15 which is the sequence1, 7, 10.  or 1, 13,7 ->11 (18 reward each). Lastly in some sequences some repeated room visit could not guarantee you the full reward for your patience and try \n1, 9 , 15; or,1, 14,8(16). Or, with any choice starting from room, one can move either right or left (startwith room ) depending on desired outcome. There is no wrong turns, room # can be adjusted accordingly, until finding all rewards with maximum advantage you seek for. Thank you. Answer: (15, 7, 11, 8). Answer:7 (10 rewards)."
