Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Set their rewards to 0 if they contain a chest, and update their rewards to the maximum between their current reward and the reward of room 1 plus the reward of the chest.\n3.

Set their rewards to 0 if they contain a chest, and update their rewards to the maximum between their current reward and the reward of room 8 plus the reward of the chest.\n6.
