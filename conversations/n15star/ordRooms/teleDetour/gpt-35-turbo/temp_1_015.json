Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Then, we need to choose the room that has the most connections to those directly connected rooms. Based on the given connections, the rooms directly connected to room 1 are rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 11.\n\n- Room 7 has connections to rooms 1, 4, 10, 13, and 15.\n- Room 10 has connections to rooms 1, 4, 7, 13, and 15.\n- Room 11 has connections to rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n- Room 13 has connections to rooms 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15.\n\nSo, the room that has the most connections to the directly connected rooms is room 7 or room 10, which both have 4 connections each. We can choose any of them as they have the same number of connections. \n\nThen, we need to choose the room that has the most connections to the directly connected rooms of the chosen room. \n\n- Room 4 has connections to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n- Room 15 has connections to rooms 4, 7, 10, and 13.\n\nSo, the next room in the path could be either room 4 or room 15. Let's choose room 4.\n\n- Room 13 has connections to rooms 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15.\n\nThe final room in the path could be room 13 as it is the only room connected to room 4.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is room 1 -> room 7 (or 10) -> room 4 -> room 13.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7 (or 10), 4, 13."
