Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a list of unvisited rooms and set the distance of all rooms except room 1 to infinity.\n2. Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and add it to the list of unvisited rooms.\n3. While there are still unvisited rooms:\n    - Choose the room with the smallest distance from the list of unvisited rooms and mark it as visited.\n    - For each neighboring room of the current room that is still unvisited, calculate the distance from room 1 to that neighboring room through the current room and update the distance if it's shorter than the current distance.\n4. Once all rooms have been visited, trace the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 to room 8 or room 15.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15."
