Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Based on the connections, we can see that the largest group of interconnected rooms contains 6 rooms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 4. Therefore, we should aim to visit all of these rooms.\n\nSince there is no connection between room 1 and 11, we cannot start by visiting room 11. The best starting point is room 7, which is connected to 1, 4, 10, 11, and 13. From there, we can visit 4, 13, 10, 1, 7, 11, 14, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\nSo, the path that yields the most reward is: 7, 4, 13, 10, 1, 11, 14, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\nAnswer: 7, 4, 13, 10, 1, 11, 14, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15."
