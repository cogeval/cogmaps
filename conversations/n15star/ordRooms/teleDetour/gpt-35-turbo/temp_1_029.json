You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Since we can only teleport once, we should choose a path that covers the most number of rooms. \n\nStarting from Room 1, we can visit Rooms 7, 10, 13, and 4, which are all connected. From Room 4, we can visit Rooms 15, 12, 6, and 3, which are also all connected. This covers a total of 9 rooms.\n\nAlternatively, we can visit Rooms 2, 5, and 8 from Room 1, which are all connected. From Room 8, we can visit Room 14 and then Room 11, which is not directly connected to Room 1 but is still accessible from Room 14. From there, we can visit Rooms 9 and 12, which are connected, and finally Room 15, covering a total of 7 rooms.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is Rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 12, 6, 3. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 12, 6, 3"
