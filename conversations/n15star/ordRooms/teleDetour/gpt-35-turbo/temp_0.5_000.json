Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13, all of which do not have any chests. From room 7, we can reach room 10 and room 13, both of which do not have any chests. From room 10, we can reach room 13, which does not have any chests. From room 13, we can reach room 4, which does not have any chests, and room 11, which has a chest with a reward of 50. From room 11, we can reach room 2, which does not have any chests, and room 14, which has a chest with a reward of 50. From room 14, we can reach room 8, which has a chest with a reward of 50. From room 8, we cannot reach room 15, which has a chest with a reward of 10, without passing through a room that we have already visited.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 13, 11, 14, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 11, 14, 8."
