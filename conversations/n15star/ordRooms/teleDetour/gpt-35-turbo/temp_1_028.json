You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Then, I will select the room with the highest reward value and follow the path to that room. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 11 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 11\n\nSince there is no connection between room 1 and 11, the reward value for this path is 0. \n\nThe reward value for each room is as follows:\nRoom 1: 10\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 5\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: 15\nRoom 8: 20\nRoom 9: 0\nRoom 10: 5\nRoom 11: 0\nRoom 12: 0\nRoom 13: 5\nRoom 14: 10\nRoom 15: 0\n\nThe room with the highest reward value is room 8 with a reward value of 20. The shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8"
