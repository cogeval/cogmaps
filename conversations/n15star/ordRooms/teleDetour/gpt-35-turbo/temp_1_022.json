We mark room 1 as the current room, and update the reward and shortest path for each of its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 1    | 0      |               |\n| 7    | 0      | 1-7           |\n| 10   | 0      | 1-10          |\n| 13   | 0      | 1-13          |\n| 8    | 50     | 1-8           |\n\n4. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is room 8. We mark room 8 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 8    | 50     | 1-8           |\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n\n5. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is room 14. We mark room 14 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-14-5     |\n| 8    | 50     | 1-8-14        |\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-14-2     |\n\n6. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is still room 8. However, its reward has already been collected, so we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 2. We mark room 2 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-14-2     |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-14-5     |\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11          |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 3    | 0      | 1-11-8-3      |\n\n7. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is room 5. However, its reward has already been collected, so we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 11. We mark room 11 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11          |\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-2        |\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-5        |\n| 1    | 0      | 1             |\n\n8. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is room 2. However, its reward has already been collected, so we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 14. We mark room 14 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11          |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-5        |\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-2        |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 1    | 0      | 1             |\n\n9. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is still room 11. However, we can't reach it from room 1 because the door is locked. So we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 5. We mark room 5 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-14-5     |\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11-14-11    |\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-14-2     |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 1    | 0      | 1             |\n\n10. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is room 11. However, we can't reach it from room 1 because the door is locked. So we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 14. However, we can't reach it from room 1 because we need to go through room 11. So we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 2. We mark room 2 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-14-2     |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-14-5     |\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11-14-11    |\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 1    | 0      | 1             |\n\n11. We choose the adjacent room with the highest reward, which is still room 5. However, its reward has already been collected, so we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 11. However, we can't reach it from room 1 because the door is locked. So we skip it and choose the next highest reward which is room 14. We mark room 14 as the new current room, and update the reward and shortest path for its adjacent rooms.\n\n| Room | Reward | Shortest Path |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 14   | 0      | 1-11-14       |\n| 5    | 0      | 1-11-14-5     |\n| 8    | 0      | 1-8-14-8      |\n| 2    | 0      | 1-11-14-2     |\n| 11   | 0      | 1-11-14-11    |\n| 1    | 0      | 1             |\n\n12.
