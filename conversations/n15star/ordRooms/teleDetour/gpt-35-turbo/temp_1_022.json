Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "To maximize the reward, we can use the shortest path algorithm. Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest distance to all other rooms using Dijkstra's algorithm. However, since we cannot teleport twice, we need to modify the algorithm slightly. Instead of marking visited nodes as we traverse the graph, we mark them as \"used\" once we teleport to them. This way, we won't revisit any room that we teleport to. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 11 is through room 7, so we need to avoid that path. After calculating the shortest distance to all rooms, we can choose the room with the highest reward, which is the sum of the distances to the connected rooms. \n\nUsing this method, the path that yields the most reward is: \n\n1 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11\n\nAnswer: 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8, 14, 11"
