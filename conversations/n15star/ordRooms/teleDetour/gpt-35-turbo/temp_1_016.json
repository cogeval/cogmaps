Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We will start by assigning a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1, which will have a tentative distance of 0. Then we will visit each connected room to room 1 and update their tentative distances to the rewards if they contain chests, and to the sum of the distance to room 1 and the distance to the visited room if they do not contain chests. We will repeat this process for each connected room until we have visited all rooms.\n\nThe tentative distances for each room are:\n\n- Room 1: 0\n- Room 7: 50\n- Room 10: 10\n- Room 11: 50\n- Room 13: 10\n- Room 8: 50\n- Room 5: 0 (visited through Room 7)\n- Room 14: 50 (visited through Room 11)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8."
