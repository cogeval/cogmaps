You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

The possible paths that connect 4 rooms and do not go through room 11 are:\n\n- Rooms 1, 7, 10, and 13\n- Rooms 1, 4, 7, and 13\n- Rooms 1, 4, 13, and 15\n\nWe can choose any of these paths since they all connect 4 rooms and do not go through room 11.
