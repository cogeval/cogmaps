Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nStarting from room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13. From room 7, we can reach rooms 4 and 13. From room 10, we can reach room 4 and from room 11, we can reach room 2. From room 13, we can reach room 4.\n\nTo find the shortest path with the highest reward, we can assign weights to the edges. The weight of the edge from room 1 to any of the reachable rooms is 0, as there is no reward yet. The weight of the edge from any reachable room to room 8 is 50 if there is a reward in room 8, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, the weight of the edge from any reachable room to room 15 is 10 if there is a reward in room 15, and 0 otherwise.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we start by initializing the distance from room 1 to all reachable rooms as infinity, except for room 7, 10, 11, and 13, which have a distance of 0. Then, we update the distances based on the weights of the edges.\n\n- Distance from room 1 to room 7: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 10: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 11: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 13: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 4: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 2: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 8: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 14: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 5: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 6: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 9: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 12: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 15: 10\n\nThe shortest path with the highest reward starts from room 1, goes to room 4, and then to room 15. The total reward collected is 10. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,4,15"

From room 4, we can now teleport to any neighboring room of room 14, which are rooms 2, 5, 8, and 11.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm again, we update the distances as follows:\n\n- Distance from room 1 to room 7: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 10: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 13: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 4: 0\n- Distance from room 1 to room 2: 60\n- Distance from room 1 to room 5: 60\n- Distance from room 1 to room 8: 60\n- Distance from room 1 to room 11: 60\n- Distance from room 1 to room 14: 50\n- Distance from room 1 to room 15: 10\n\nNow, the shortest path with the highest reward starts from room 1, goes to room 4, teleports to room 14, and then goes to room 15.
