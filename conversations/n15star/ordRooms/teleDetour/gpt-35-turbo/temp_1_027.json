Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

One possible approach is to use a depth-first search algorithm to explore all paths and keep track of the longest one that does not include room 11.\n\nHere is the path with the most rooms that can be reached from room 1 without passing through room 11:\n\n```\n1 - 7 - 13 - 10 - 4 - 15 - 12 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 8 - 14\n```\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 10, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 2, 5, 8, 14"
