Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Initialize all rooms with distance of infinity, except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. Also, initialize an empty set of visited rooms and a dictionary of rewards for each room.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each adjacent room of the current room that has not been visited, calculate the distance from the starting room to that room, and update the reward for that room if there is a chest in it. Then, update the distance of that room if it is shorter than the current distance.\n\n4. Add the current room to the visited set.\n\n5. Among the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the highest reward and shortest distance to be the new current room.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until there are no more unvisited rooms or the destination room has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15\n\nThis path has a distance of 6 and a reward of 10. The path 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 12 -> 15 also has a reward of 10, but it has a longer distance of 7."
