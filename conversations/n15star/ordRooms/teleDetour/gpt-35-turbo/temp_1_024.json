Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark room 1 as visited.\n3. For each room adjacent to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13), calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to that room (which is 0 + the reward of the chest in that room).\n4. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to that room, update the distance with the tentative distance.\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for all adjacent rooms to the visited rooms until all rooms have been visited.\n6. The shortest path that yields the most reward is the path that leads to the chest with the highest reward and has the shortest distance.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path starting from room 1: \n\n1 -> 8 \n\nThe reward for the chest in room 8 is 50, which is higher than the reward for the chest in room 15. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 8"
