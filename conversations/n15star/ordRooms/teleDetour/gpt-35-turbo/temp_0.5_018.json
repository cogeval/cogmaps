Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.
