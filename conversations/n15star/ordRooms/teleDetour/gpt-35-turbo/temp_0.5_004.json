You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The reward for each room can be considered as the weight of the corresponding edge in the graph.

We repeat this process until we reach room 8 or room 15. \n\nThe distances from room 1 to all other rooms are:\n- Room 1: 0\n- Room 2: infinity\n- Room 3: infinity\n- Room 4: infinity\n- Room 5: infinity\n- Room 6: infinity\n- Room 7: 1\n- Room 8: 2\n- Room 9: 3\n- Room 10: 1\n- Room 11: 2\n- Room 12: 4\n- Room 13: 1\n- Room 14: 3\n- Room 15: 4\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is to visit room 8, which has a reward of 50.
