Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

We start at room 1 and explore all possible paths to the other rooms, assigning a weight to each edge based on the reward associated with reaching the destination room. The path with the highest total weight will be the one that yields the most reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's Algorithm, we can find the following path from room 1 that yields the most reward: \n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8, 14, 11, 5, 2, 4"
