Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Specifically, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Room 1 to either Room 8 or Room 15 and then return the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can compute the shortest distance and previous node for each room from Room 1. Then, we can trace back from Room 8 and Room 15 to Room 1 to find the shortest path with the highest reward.\n\nHere are the steps to find the path:\n\n1. Compute the shortest distance and previous node for each room from Room 1 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n2. Check which of Room 8 and Room 15 can be reached from Room 1 and has the higher reward.\n3. Trace back from the chosen room to Room 1 to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this method, the shortest path that yields the most reward from Room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15."

We can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward from Room 1. The modifications are:\n\n1. If we encounter the locked door from Room 1 to Room 11 or the teleportation portal from Room 4, we skip the corresponding edge in the graph.\n2. When we reach Room 8 or Room 15, we return the path that leads to the chest with the higher reward.\n\nHere are the steps to find the path:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue and a dictionary to store the shortest distance and previous node for each room.\n2. Initialize the priority queue with Room 1 and its distance to 0.\n3. Loop while the priority queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue the room with the shortest distance.\n   2. For each neighboring room that can be reached without encountering the locked door or the teleportation portal:\n      1. Compute the distance to the neighboring room.\n      2. If the new distance is shorter, update the dictionary and enqueue the neighboring room.\n4. Trace back from the chosen room to Room 1 to find the shortest path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing this method, the shortest path that yields the most reward from Room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 14, 11, 2, 5, 8.
