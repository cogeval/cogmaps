Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start from room 1 and initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity except for room 1 which is 0. Also, create an empty set of visited rooms.\n\n2. Among the neighboring rooms of room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13), room 11 has the highest reward (50). So, we visit room 11 and collect the reward.\n\n3. Update the distance of neighboring rooms of room 11 (rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14) as the sum of the distance to room 11 and the reward of the chest in that room. For example, the distance to room 8 is now 50 (the reward of the chest in room 8) + the distance from room 1 to room 11 (which is 1) = 51.\n\n4. Among the neighboring rooms of room 11, room 14 has the highest reward (0). So, we visit room 14 and do not collect any reward.\n\n5. Update the distance of neighboring rooms of room 14 (rooms 2, 5, and 8) as the sum of the distance to room 14 and the reward of the chest in that room. For example, the distance to room 8 is now 50 (the reward of the chest in room 8) + the distance from room 1 to room 11 (which is 1) + the distance from room 11 to room 14 (which is 1) = 52.\n\n6. Among the neighboring rooms of room 14, room 8 has the highest reward (50). So, we visit room 8 and collect the reward.\n\n7. We have now collected the highest reward possible and there is no need to visit any other room. The shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 11, 14, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8."
