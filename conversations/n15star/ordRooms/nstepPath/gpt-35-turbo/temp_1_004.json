Starting from room 7, we can explore all adjacent rooms and add them to a queue. We can then explore the adjacent rooms of each of those rooms until we find room 8. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start at room 7.\n2. Add room 10 and room 13 to the queue.\n3. Explore room 10 and add room 11 and room 13 to the queue.\n4. Explore room 13 and add room 4 and room 10 to the queue.\n5. Explore room 11 and add room 2 and room 14 to the queue.\n6. Explore room 4 and add room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 to the queue.\n7. Explore room 2 and add room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 to the queue.\n8. Explore room 14 and add room 2 and room 11 to the queue.\n9. Explore room 5 and add room 2, room 8, and room 11 to the queue.\n10. Explore room 8 and stop because we have found the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 7 to room 8 is: 7, 10, 11, 8.\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 11, 8."
