            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room. Set the initial value to infinity for all rooms except room 1, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Mark all rooms unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from room 1 to the current room, plus the distance from the current room to the neighboring room. If this tentative distance is less than the current distance value for the neighboring room, update the neighboring room's distance value.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighboring rooms, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new \"current room\" then repeat from step 3.\n6. Stop when the destination room (room 12) has been marked visited. The shortest path can be obtained by working backwards from the destination room, using the distances calculated in the algorithm.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: \n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12"
