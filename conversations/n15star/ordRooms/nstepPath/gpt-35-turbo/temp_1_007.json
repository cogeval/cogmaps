            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use a graph algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with each room as a node and the connecting paths as edges. Each edge has a weight of 1 since all rooms are connected equally.\n2. Initialize a distance array with the distance from room 1 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which has a distance of 0.\n3. Initialize a visited array with all rooms marked as unvisited.\n4. While there are unvisited rooms:\n    - Find the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 1 and mark it as visited.\n    - For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the weight of the edge connecting them. If this distance is smaller than the current distance in the distance array, update the distance array with the new distance.\n5. Once all rooms have been visited, the distance array will contain the shortest distance from room 1 to all other rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 7, 13, 10, 4, 15, 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 10, 4, 15, 12."
