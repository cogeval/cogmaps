Initially, the distance to room 2 is 0, and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n2.

For each room adjacent to room 2 (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14), update the distance in the table if the new distance is shorter than the current distance.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n4.
