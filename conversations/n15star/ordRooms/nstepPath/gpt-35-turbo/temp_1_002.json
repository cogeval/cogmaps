Create a list of unvisited rooms and initialize the distances to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which is set to 0. Set the previous room of all rooms to null.\n\n```\nUnvisited rooms: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\nDistances: 0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf\nPrevious: null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null\n```\n\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 1). Visit this room and update the distances of its neighboring rooms.\n\n```\nUnvisited rooms: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\nDistances: 0, 1, inf, inf, inf, 1, inf, inf, inf, 1, inf, 1, inf, inf, inf\nPrevious: null, 1, null, null, null, 1, null, null, null, 1, null, 1, null, null, null\n```\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until all rooms have been visited and their distances have been updated. The final result will be:\n\n```\nUnvisited rooms: \nDistances: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4\nPrevious: null, 1, 2, 7, 2, 5, 1, 11, 8, 1, 11, 9, 12, 11, 12\n```\n\n4. To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can start from room 12 and follow the path of previous rooms until we reach room 1. The path will be:\n\n```\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 12\n```\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,12"
