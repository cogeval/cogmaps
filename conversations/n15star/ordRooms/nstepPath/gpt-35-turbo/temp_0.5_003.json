Create a set of unvisited rooms and set the distance of all rooms to infinity except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. \n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance from room 1 to that neighboring room. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance of the neighboring room, update its distance.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Among the unvisited rooms, choose the room with the smallest distance and set it as the new current room.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination room (room 3) is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 3 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 12, 3.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 12, 3."
