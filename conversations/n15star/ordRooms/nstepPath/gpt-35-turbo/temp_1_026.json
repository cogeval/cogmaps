Create a table to track the shortest distances from room 1 to each of the other rooms. Initialize the distance of room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n2. Start at room 1 and look at all the rooms that it is connected to (rooms 7, 10, 11, 13). For each of these rooms, calculate the distance to get there from room 1 (which is 1), and update the distance in the table if this distance is shorter than the current shortest distance.\n\n3. Next, look at the rooms that are connected to the rooms we just looked at: rooms 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15. For each of these rooms, calculate the distance to get there from room 1 (which is 2), and update the distance in the table if this distance is shorter than the current shortest distance.\n\n4. Continue this process, looking at rooms that are connected to rooms that we have already looked at, and updating the distance table as necessary. Keep going until we have looked at room 12 and updated its distance in the table.\n\n5. The final table should have the shortest distance from room 1 to room 12. To find the shortest path, we can backtrack through the table, starting at room 12 and following the path of shortest distances back to room 1.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is:\n\n1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12\n\nAnswer: 10, 13, 15, 12"
