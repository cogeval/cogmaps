            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 1. Initially, set the distance of room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity. Also, mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 0        | Yes     |\n| 2    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 3    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 4    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 5    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 6    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 7    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 8    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 9    | \u221e        | No      |\n| 10   | \u221e        | No      |\n| 11   | \u221e        | No      |\n| 12   | \u221e        | No      |\n| 13   | \u221e        | No      |\n| 14   | \u221e        | No      |\n| 15   | \u221e        | No      |\n\n2. Starting from room 1, visit the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it's room 7, which is connected to room 1.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room (room 7), calculate the distance to that room through the current room. If this distance is smaller than the current distance of that room in the table, update the table with the new distance. Also, mark the current room as the previous room for the neighboring room.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited | Previous |\n|------|----------|---------|----------|\n| 1    | 0        | Yes     | -        |\n| 2    | 1        | No      | 5        |\n| 3    | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n| 4    | 1        | No      | 7        |\n| 5    | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n| 6    | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n| 7    | 0        | Yes     | -        |\n| 8    | 2        | No      | 7        |\n| 9    | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n| 10   | 1        | No      | 7        |\n| 11   | 1        | No      | 7        |\n| 12   | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n| 13   | 1        | No      | 7        |\n| 14   | 2        | No      | 11       |\n| 15   | \u221e        | No      | -        |\n\n4. Mark the current room (room 7) as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited.\n\n6. To find the shortest path, start from the destination room (room 12) and follow the previous rooms until you reach the starting room (room 1). The shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 10, 7, 4, 13, 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 7, 4, 13, 12."
