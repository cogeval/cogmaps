Set the initial distances to infinity for all rooms except room 3, which we set to 0.\n2. Set the initial unvisited set to all rooms.\n3. For the current room (starting with room 3), visit each of its neighbors and calculate the distance to each neighbor by adding the distance from the current room to the neighbor to the current room's distance. If this distance is shorter than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n5. If the destination room (room 10) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the shortest distance as the next current room and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 3 to room 10 is:\n\n3, 8, 14, 11, 10\n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 14, 11, 10"
