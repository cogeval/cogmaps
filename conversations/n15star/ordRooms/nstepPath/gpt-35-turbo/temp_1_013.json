Initially, the distance to room 1 is 0 and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n2. Mark room 1 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 1, update its distance in the table if the distance through room 1 is shorter than its current distance.\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until room 12 is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12"
