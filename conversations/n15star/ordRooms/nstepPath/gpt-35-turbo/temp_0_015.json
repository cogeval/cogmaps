Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, and Visited. Initially, set the Distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 2 which is set to 0. Set Visited to False for all rooms.\n\n2. Starting from room 2, update the Distance of all adjacent rooms (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14) to 1. \n\n3. Mark room 2 as Visited.\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 5) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 8, 11, and 14). \n\n5. Mark room 5 as Visited.\n\n6. Repeat step 4 until room 4 is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 4 is: 2, 5, 8, 4.\n\nAnswer: 2, 5, 8, 4"
