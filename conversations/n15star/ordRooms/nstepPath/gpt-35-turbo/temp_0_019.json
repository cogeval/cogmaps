Starting from room 8, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to the shortest path. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance of room 8 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Set the unvisited set to contain all rooms.\n3. While the unvisited set is not empty:\n   a. Find the room in the unvisited set with the smallest distance and remove it from the set.\n   b. For each neighboring room that is still in the unvisited set, calculate the distance to that room through the current room. If this distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance and the previous room.\n4. Once we have calculated the shortest path to all rooms, we can backtrack from room 10 to room 8 using the previous room information.\n\nThe shortest path from room 8 to room 10 is: 8, 11, 10\n\nAnswer: 8, 11, 10"
