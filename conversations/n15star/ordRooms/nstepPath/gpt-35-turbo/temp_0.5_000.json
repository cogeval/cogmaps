            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n   Tentative distances: {1: 0, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: inf, 11: inf, 12: inf, 13: inf, 14: inf, 15: inf}\n\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n   Current room: 1\n   Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the lower one. For example, if the current room is room 1 and its neighbor is room 7, the tentative distance to room 7 is 1 (distance from 1 to 7) + 1 (distance from 7 to 10) + 1 (distance from 10 to 13) + 1 (distance from 13 to 12) = 4. If the current assigned distance to room 7 is infinity or greater than 4, then we update its assigned distance to 4.\n   Tentative distances: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: 4, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: 2, 11: 3, 12: 4, 13: 3, 14: inf, 15: inf}\n\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n   Visited set: {1}\n   Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15}\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. If we had updated the tentative distance of any room in step 3, we may have to update the current room as well.\n   Current room: 2\n   Unvisited set: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15}\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited. Once it has been visited, the shortest path algorithm has finished and the shortest distance value to room 12 has been found.\n   Tentative distances: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 4, 9: 4, 10: 2, 11: 3, 12: 4, 13: 3, 14: 4, 15: 4}\n   Visited set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}\n   Unvisited set: {13, 14, 15}\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,12"
