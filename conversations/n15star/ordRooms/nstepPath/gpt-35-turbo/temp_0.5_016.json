            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with the distance from room 5 to each room and mark them as unvisited. The distance to room 5 is 0, and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance | Visited\n-------------------------\n  1  |   inf    |   No\n  2  |   inf    |   No\n  3  |   inf    |   No\n  4  |   inf    |   No\n  5  |    0     |   No\n  6  |   inf    |   No\n  7  |   inf    |   No\n  8  |   inf    |   No\n  9  |   inf    |   No\n 10  |   inf    |   No\n 11  |   inf    |   No\n 12  |   inf    |   No\n 13  |   inf    |   No\n 14  |   inf    |   No\n 15  |   inf    |   No\n```\n\n2. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from the table. In this case, it is room 5 with a distance of 0. Mark it as visited.\n```\nRoom | Distance | Visited\n-------------------------\n  1  |   inf    |   No\n  2  |   inf    |   No\n  3  |   inf    |   No\n  4  |   inf    |   No\n  5  |    0     |  Yes\n  6  |   inf    |   No\n  7  |   inf    |   No\n  8  |   inf    |   No\n  9  |   inf    |   No\n 10  |   inf    |   No\n 11  |   inf    |   No\n 12  |   inf    |   No\n 13  |   inf    |   No\n 14  |   inf    |   No\n 15  |   inf    |   No\n```\n\n3. Update the distances of the neighboring rooms that are not yet visited. The distances are the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room. For example, the distance to room 8 is 0 + 1 = 1, because room 5 is connected to room 8. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the table. Repeat this step until all rooms are visited.\n```\nRoom | Distance | Visited\n-------------------------\n  1  |     3    |   No\n  2  |     2    |   No\n  3  |     3    |   No\n  4  |     4    |   No\n  5  |     0    |  Yes\n  6  |     4    |   No\n  7  |     3    |   No\n  8  |     1    |  Yes\n  9  |     5    |   No\n 10  |     4    |   No\n 11  |     1    |   No\n 12  |     5    |   No\n 13  |     3    |   No\n 14  |     2    |   No\n 15  |     6    |   No\n```\n\n4. The shortest path from room 5 to room 15 is the sequence of rooms with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 15. Therefore, the answer is:\n```\nAnswer: 5, 8, 11, 15\n```"
