Initialize the \"visited\" column to false for all rooms and the \"distance\" column to infinity for all rooms except room 8, which should be 0.\n2. Starting at room 8, look at all of its neighbors (rooms 14 and 11) and update their \"distance\" values to 1. Mark room 8 as visited.\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest \"distance\" value (room 14) and repeat step 2 for that room.\n4. Continue to repeat step 3 until all rooms have been visited. At each step, update the \"distance\" values of neighboring unvisited rooms if a shorter path is found.\n5. Once all rooms have been visited, the \"distance\" value for room 13 will be the shortest path from room 8 to room 13. We can then backtrack from room 13 to room 8 by following the path of smallest distance values.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 8 to room 13 is:\n\nAnswer: 8, 14, 11, 10, 13"
