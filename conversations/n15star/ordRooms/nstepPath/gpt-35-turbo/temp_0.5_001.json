Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n    - Distance: {1: 0, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: inf, 11: inf, 12: inf, 13: inf, 14: inf, 15: inf}\n\n2. Set the initial room as the current room and create a set of visited rooms.\n    - Current room: 1\n    - Visited: {}\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its adjacent rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to each adjacent room is the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the current room and the adjacent room. If this tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to the adjacent room, update the distance.\n    - Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: 1, 11: 1, 12: 2, 13: 1, 14: 2, 15: 3}\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room.\n    - Current room: 7\n    - Visited: {1}\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited.\n    - Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 1, 11: 1, 12: 2, 13: 1, 14: 2, 15: 3}\n    - Current room: 10\n    - Visited: {1, 7, 10}\n    - Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 1, 11: 1, 12: 2, 13: 1, 14: 2, 15: 3}\n    - Current room: 13\n    - Visited: {1, 7, 10, 13}\n    - Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 1, 11: 1, 12: 2, 13: 1, 14: 2, 15: 3}\n    - Current room: 12\n    - Visited: {1, 7, 10, 12, 13}\n\n6. The shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is the list of rooms visited in order: 1, 7, 10, 12.\n    \nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 12"
