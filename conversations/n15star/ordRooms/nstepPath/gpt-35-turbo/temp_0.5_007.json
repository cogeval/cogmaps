Create a table with the following columns: \"Visited\", \"Distance\", and \"Previous\". Initialize all \"Visited\" values to False, \"Distance\" values to infinity, and \"Previous\" values to None.\n2. Set the \"Distance\" value of room 10 to 0.\n3. While there are unvisited rooms:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest \"Distance\" value. Call this room \"current\".\n   b. For each neighbor of \"current\" that is unvisited:\n      i. Calculate the tentative distance from \"current\" to the neighbor.\n      ii. If the tentative distance is less than the neighbor's current \"Distance\" value, update the neighbor's \"Distance\" value and \"Previous\" value.\n   c. Mark \"current\" as visited.\n4. Create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n5. Starting with room 3, follow the \"Previous\" values back to room 10, adding each room to the beginning of the list.\n6. Return the list of room numbers in order, including 10, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: 10,13,1,3"
