Starting from room 3, we can visit its adjacent rooms, which are room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. From these rooms, we can visit their adjacent rooms and so on until we reach room 13. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start at room 3\n2. Visit room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8\n3. From room 6, visit room 15\n4. From room 9, visit room 12 and room 15\n5. From room 12, visit room 15\n6. From room 8, visit room 14\n7. From room 15, visit room 13\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 13 is: 3, 8, 14, 13\n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 14, 13"
