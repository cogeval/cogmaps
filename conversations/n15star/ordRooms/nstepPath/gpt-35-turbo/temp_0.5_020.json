Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each room adjacent to the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room (room 1) to that adjacent room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance for that adjacent room, update the tentative distance to the new lower value.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms left, stop.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 as:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 12\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 12"
