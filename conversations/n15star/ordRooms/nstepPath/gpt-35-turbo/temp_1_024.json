Here are the steps for using BFS:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to represent the connections between rooms.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue the starting room (room 3) in it.\n3. Create a set to keep track of visited rooms and add the starting room to it.\n4. Create a dictionary to keep track of the path from the starting room to each visited room. Initialize it with the starting room as the only key-value pair.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n  a. Dequeue the next room from the queue.\n  b. For each of its neighboring rooms that have not been visited yet:\n    i. Add the neighboring room to the visited set.\n    ii. Add the neighboring room to the queue.\n    iii. Add the neighboring room to the path dictionary with the current room as its value.\n  c. If the destination room (room 7) has been visited, break the loop.\n6. Use the path dictionary to construct the shortest path from room 3 to room 7.\n\nFollowing the above steps, the shortest path from room 3 to room 7 is:\n\n3, 8, 7\n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 7"
