Create a set of unvisited rooms and initialize their distances from room 1 as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which is initialized as 0.\n\n2. Mark room 1 as the current room and set its distance as the tentative distance.\n\n3. For each of the rooms connected to the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 1 through the current room to each of these connected rooms. Update the distance of each connected room if the tentative distance is shorter than the previous distance.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the shortest tentative distance and make it the current room.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination room, which is room 12, is visited.\n\nHere are the distances to each room and the path to room 12:\n\nRoom 1: distance 0, path 1\nRoom 2: distance 1, path 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 3, 12\nRoom 3: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 3\nRoom 4: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 13, 15\nRoom 5: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 11, 14, 8, 5\nRoom 6: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 9, 6\nRoom 7: distance 1, path 1, 7\nRoom 8: distance 3, path 1, 7, 10, 11, 14, 8\nRoom 9: distance 3, path 1, 7, 10, 9\nRoom 10: distance 1, path 1, 7, 10\nRoom 11: distance 3, path 1, 7, 10, 11\nRoom 12: distance 3, path 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 12\nRoom 13: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 13\nRoom 14: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 11, 14\nRoom 15: distance 2, path 1, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 9, 6, 12"
