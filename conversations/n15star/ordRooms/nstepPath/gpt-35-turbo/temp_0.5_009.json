Starting from room 13, we can calculate the shortest distance to each of the connected rooms, and then continue to explore the closest unvisited room until we reach room 3.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance to room 13 as 0, and the distance to all other rooms as infinity.\n2. Mark room 13 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 13 (i.e. room 7, room 10, room 11, and room 1), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 13 (which is 0) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 10, with a distance of 1), and mark it as visited.\n5. For each room connected to room 10 (i.e. room 7, room 13, and room 4), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 10 (which is 1) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 7, with a distance of 2), and mark it as visited.\n7. For each room connected to room 7 (i.e. room 4, room 10, and room 1), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 7 (which is 2) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n8. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 1, with a distance of 3), and mark it as visited.\n9. For each room connected to room 1 (i.e. room 7, room 10, room 11, and room 13), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 1 (which is 3) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 11, with a distance of 4), and mark it as visited.\n11. For each room connected to room 11 (i.e. room 2, room 5, room 14, and room 1), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 11 (which is 4) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n12. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 5, with a distance of 5), and mark it as visited.\n13. For each room connected to room 5 (i.e. room 8, room 11, and room 14), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 5 (which is 5) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n14. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 8, with a distance of 6), and mark it as visited.\n15. For each room connected to room 8 (i.e. room 14 and room 3), calculate the distance as the sum of the distance to room 8 (which is 6) and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1). Update the distance of each connected room accordingly.\n16. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 3, with a distance of 7), and mark it as visited.\n17. We have reached our destination, room 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 13 to room 3 is: 13, 1, 11, 5, 8, 3.\n\nAnswer: 13, 1, 11, 5, 8, 3."
