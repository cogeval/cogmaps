Assign a tentative distance value of zero to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to that room through the current room. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to that neighboring room, update the distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 12) has been visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms is infinity (meaning there is no path to the destination room), stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room and go to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: \n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 -> 12\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12"
