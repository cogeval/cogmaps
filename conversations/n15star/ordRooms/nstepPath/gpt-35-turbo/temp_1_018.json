We then compute the distances from Room 8 to these neighboring rooms, as follows:\n\n- Room 5: distance from Room 8 to Room 5 is 1\n- Room 11: distance from Room 8 to Room 11 is 1\n- Room 14: distance from Room 8 to Room 14 is 1\n\nNext, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 5. We then mark Room 5 as visited, and repeat the above steps for its neighboring rooms: Room 2, Room 11, and Room 8. However, we skip Room 8 since it has already been visited. We compute the distances from Room 5 to these neighboring rooms, as follows:\n\n- Room 2: distance from Room 5 to Room 2 is 2\n- Room 11: distance from Room 5 to Room 11 is 2\n\nNext, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 11. We then mark Room 11 as visited, and repeat the above steps for its neighboring rooms: Room 1, Room 14, Room 5, and Room 2. However, we skip Room 5 and Room 8 since they have already been visited. We compute the distances from Room 11 to these neighboring rooms, as follows:\n\n- Room 1: distance from Room 11 to Room 1 is 3\n- Room 14: distance from Room 11 to Room 14 is 3\n- Room 2: distance from Room 11 to Room 2 is 3\n\nNext, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 2. We then mark Room 2 as visited, and repeat the above steps for its neighboring rooms: Room 5 and Room 8. However, we skip Room 8 since it has already been visited. We compute the distances from Room 2 to these neighboring rooms, as follows:\n\n- Room 5: distance from Room 2 to Room 5 is 3\n\nNext, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 5. We then mark Room 5 as visited, and repeat the above steps for its neighboring rooms: Room 11 and Room 14. However, we skip Room 11 since it has already been visited. We compute the distances from Room 5 to these neighboring rooms, as follows:\n\n- Room 14: distance from Room 5 to Room 14 is 4\n\nNext, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 14. We then mark Room 14 as visited, and repeat the above steps for its neighboring rooms: Room 11. However, we skip Room 11 since it has already been visited. We compute the distance from Room 14 to Room 11, as follows:\n\n- Room 11: distance from Room 14 to Room 11 is 4\n\nFinally, we pick the room with the shortest distance, which is Room 11. Since Room 11 is our destination, we have found the shortest path from Room 8 to Room 7, which is:\n\nAnswer: 8, 11, 7"
