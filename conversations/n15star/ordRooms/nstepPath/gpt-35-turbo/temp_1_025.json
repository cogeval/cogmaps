Set the distance of all the rooms to infinity, except for room 3 which is set to 0.\n2. Set the current room to room 3.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance from the current room to the neighboring room (which is always 1 in this case). If this distance plus the distance to the current room is less than the current known distance to the neighboring room, update the distance of the neighboring room to this new distance and set the predecessor of the neighboring room to the current room.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance and set it as the new current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room is visited or there are no more unvisited rooms with finite distance.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 3 to room 10 is: \n\n3, 8, 14, 11, 10\n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 14, 11, 10"
