            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 6 to room 11, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from the starting room (room 6). Set the distance of room 6 to 0 and all other rooms to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | 0        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 6 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 6 (rooms 9, 12, and 15), update its distance in the table to the distance from room 6 plus the distance to that room. For example, the distance to room 9 is 1, so its distance in the table becomes 1.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | 0        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | 1        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | 1        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | 1        |\n\n4. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet (room 9 in this case) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room adjacent to the newly visited room (room 12 and room 15), update its distance in the table if it is smaller than the current distance. For example, the distance to room 12 through room 9 is 2, which is smaller than the current distance of  \u221e, so its distance in the table becomes 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | 0        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | 1        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | 1        |\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all rooms have been visited or the destination room (room 11) has been reached.\n\n7. The shortest path from room 6 to room 11 is the sequence of rooms with the smallest distance from room 6 to room 11. In this case, the shortest path is:\n\n6, 9, 12, 11\n\nSo the answer is: Answer: 6, 9, 12, 11"
