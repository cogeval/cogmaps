Initialize all distances to infinity and the starting node (room 1) to 0.\n2. Visit the next closest node (room 7) and update the distances to its neighbors (room 4, room 10, room 13, and room 11).\n3. Visit the next closest node (room 10) and update the distances to its neighbors (room 13 and room 7).\n4. Visit the next closest node (room 13) and update the distances to its neighbor (room 12) and to room 7.\n5. Visit the next closest node (room 11) and update the distance to its neighbor (room 14).\n6. Visit the next closest node (room 14) and update the distance to its neighbor (room 12).\n7. Visit the next closest node (room 12).\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 12\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 12"
