            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 4, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 5. Initially, set the distance of room 5 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |    0\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 5 (i.e. room 8, room 11, and room 14), update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, the distance from room 5 to room 8 is 1, so we update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |    0\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    1\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |    1\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 8) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room adjacent to room 8 (i.e. room 2, room 5, room 11, and room 14), update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, the distance from room 8 to room 5 is 1, so we update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |    1\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    1\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |    1\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 11) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. For each room adjacent to room 11 (i.e. room 1, room 2, room 5, and room 14), update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, the distance from room 11 to room 14 is 1, so we update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |    1\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    1\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |    1\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n8. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 14) and mark it as visited.\n\n9. For each room adjacent to room 14 (i.e. room 2, room 5, and room 11), update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, the distance from room 14 to room 4 is 1, so we update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |    2\n  5  |    1\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    1\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |    1\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 5) and mark it as visited.\n\n11. Since room 4 is now the only unvisited room, we have found the shortest path from room 5 to room 4. The path is: 5, 14, 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 5, 14, 4."
