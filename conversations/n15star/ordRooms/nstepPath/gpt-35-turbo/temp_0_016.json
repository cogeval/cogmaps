Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, and Visited. Initially, set the Distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 5 which is set to 0. Set Visited to False for all rooms.\n\n2. Starting from room 5, update the Distance of all adjacent rooms (rooms 8, 11, and 14) to 1. Mark room 5 as Visited.\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 8) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 3, 5, 11, and 14). Update the Distance of room 14 to 2.\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 11) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14). Update the Distance of room 15 to 3.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 14) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 2, 5, 8, and 11).\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 2) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14).\n\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 8) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 3, 5, 11, and 14).\n\n8. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 3) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 6, 8, 9, and 12).\n\n9. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 6) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 9, 12, and 15).\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 9) and repeat step 2 for its adjacent rooms (rooms 12 and 15).\n\n11. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest Distance (room 12) and mark it as Visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 5 to room 15 is: 5, 11, 14, 2, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\nAnswer: 5, 11, 14, 2, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15."
