Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to the starting room (room 14) and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the starting room as the current room.\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room to that neighbor through the current room. If this distance is less than the neighbor's current tentative distance value, update the neighbor's tentative distance value to this distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance value and set it as the new current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 15) is visited or there are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 14 to room 15 is:\n\n14, 11, 8, 14, 15\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 8, 14, 15"
