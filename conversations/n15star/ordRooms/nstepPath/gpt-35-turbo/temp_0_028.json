Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, and Visited. Initially, set the distance of all rooms to infinity and Visited to False, except for room 6, which should have a distance of 0.\n\n2. Starting from room 6, calculate the distance to all adjacent rooms (rooms 9, 12, and 15). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n3. Mark room 6 as Visited.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 9.\n\n5. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 3, 12, and 15). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n6. Mark room 9 as Visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 12.\n\n8. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 6 and 15). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n9. Mark room 12 as Visited.\n\n10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 15.\n\n11. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 4 and 6). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n12. Mark room 15 as Visited.\n\n13. Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 6 again.\n\n14. Since room 11 is adjacent to room 5, which is adjacent to room 8, which is adjacent to room 14, which is adjacent to room 11, the shortest path from room 6 to room 11 is: 6, 9, 12, 15, 6, 5, 8, 14, 11.\n\nAnswer: 6, 9, 12, 15, 6, 5, 8, 14, 11."
