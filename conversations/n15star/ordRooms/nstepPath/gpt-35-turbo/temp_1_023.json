Mark the distance to all rooms as infinity except for room 14, which we mark as 0. We also add all rooms to the unvisited set.\n2. Set the current room as room 14. \n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, we calculate the distance from the starting room to that adjacent room. If this distance is less than the previously recorded distance, we update the distance to this adjacent room and mark the current room as its predecessor.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 4) has been visited, we exit the loop.\n6. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms, exit the loop.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the destination room has been visited or there are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 14 to room 4 is:\n\n14, 11, 2, 8, 4\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 2, 8, 4"
