Look at all the rooms connected to room 14: rooms 5, 8, and 11.\n3. Calculate the distance from room 14 to each of these rooms: room 5 is 1 unit away, room 8 is 1 unit away, and room 11 is 1 unit away.\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is either room 5, room 8, or room 11. Let's choose room 8.\n5. Look at all the rooms connected to room 8 that we haven't visited yet: rooms 2, 3, and 14.\n6. Calculate the distance from room 14 to each of these rooms through room 8: room 2 is 2 units away, room 3 is 2 units away, and room 14 is 0 units away (we're already there).\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is either room 2 or room 3. Let's choose room 3.\n8. Look at all the rooms connected to room 3 that we haven't visited yet: rooms 6, 8, 9, and 12.\n9. Calculate the distance from room 14 to each of these rooms through rooms 8 and 3: room 6 is 3 units away, room 8 is 1 unit away (we've already been there), room 9 is 3 units away, and room 12 is 3 units away.\n10. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 8 (since we've already been to room 8, we can skip it).\n11. Look at all the rooms connected to room 8 that we haven't visited yet: rooms 2 and 14.\n12. Calculate the distance from room 14 to each of these rooms through rooms 8 and 3: room 2 is 4 units away, and room 14 is 0 units away (we're already there).\n13. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 14.\n14. We've reached room 4, so we're done.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 4 is: 14, 8, 3, 14, 4.\n\nAnswer: 14, 8, 3, 14, 4."
