For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the tentative distance from the starting room (room 7) to that room. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance, update the distance value.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 3) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room. Go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 7 to room 3 is:\n\n7, 10, 13, 12, 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 7, 10, 13, 12, 3"
