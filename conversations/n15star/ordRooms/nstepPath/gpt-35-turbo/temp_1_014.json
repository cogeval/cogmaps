Set it to zero for room 2, and infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room to room 2, and mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room (room 2), calculate the distance to that room through the current room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance for that room, update the tentative distance for that room.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until either the target room (room 15) is visited, or all reachable rooms have been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from room 2 to room 15, which is: \n\n2, 11, 14, 8, 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 11, 14, 8, 15"
