            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and infinity for all other rooms.\n   - Room 1: 0\n   - Rooms 2-15: infinity\n\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n   - Current room: 1\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighboring room, through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 1 and its neighbor is room 7, the tentative distance to room 7 would be 1 (since they are directly connected), and we compare that to the current assigned value of infinity. Since 1 is smaller than infinity, we update the assigned value for room 7 to be 1.\n   - Room 7: 1\n\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n   - Visited set: {1}\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat steps 3-5 until all rooms have been visited.\n   - Current room: 7\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n   - Room 10: 2\n   - Room 13: 2\n   - Room 11: 2\n   - Room 4: 2\n   - Room 2: 2\n   - Room 5: 2\n   - Room 8: 2\n   - Room 14: 2\n   - Room 3: 3\n   - Room 6: 3\n   - Room 9: 3\n   - Room 12: 3\n   - Current room: 10\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n   - Room 13: 2\n   - Room 7: 3\n   - Room 11: 3\n   - Room 14: 3\n   - Room 8: 4\n   - Room 5: 4\n   - Room 2: 4\n   - Room 4: 5\n   - Room 3: 6\n   - Room 6: 6\n   - Room 9: 6\n   - Room 12: 6\n   - Current room: 13\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15}\n   - Room 11: 3\n   - Room 7: 4\n   - Room 14: 4\n   - Room 8: 5\n   - Room 5: 5\n   - Room 2: 5\n   - Room 4: 6\n   - Room 3: 7\n   - Room 6: 7\n   - Room 9: 7\n   - Room 12: 7\n   - Current room: 11\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15}\n   - Room 14: 4\n   - Room 8: 5\n   - Room 5: 5\n   - Room 2: 5\n   - Room 7: 5\n   - Room 4: 6\n   - Room 3: 8\n   - Room 6: 8\n   - Room 9: 8\n   - Room 12: 8\n   - Current room: 14\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 8: 5\n   - Room 5: 5\n   - Room 2: 5\n   - Room 4: 6\n   - Room 7: 6\n   - Room 3: 9\n   - Room 6: 9\n   - Room 9: 9\n   - Room 12: 9\n   - Current room: 8\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 5: 5\n   - Room 2: 5\n   - Room 7: 6\n   - Room 4: 7\n   - Room 3: 10\n   - Room 6: 10\n   - Room 9: 10\n   - Room 12: 10\n   - Current room: 5\n   - Unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 2: 5\n   - Room 7: 6\n   - Room 4: 7\n   - Room 6: 8\n   - Room 9: 8\n   - Room 12: 8\n   - Current room: 2\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 7: 6\n   - Room 4: 7\n   - Room 6: 8\n   - Room 9: 8\n   - Room 12: 8\n   - Current room: 7\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 4: 7\n   - Room 6: 8\n   - Room 9: 8\n   - Room 12: 8\n   - Current room: 4\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 6: 9\n   - Room 9: 9\n   - Room 12: 9\n   - Current room: 6\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 9, 12, 15}\n   - Room 9: 9\n   - Room 12: 9\n   - Current room: 9\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 12, 15}\n   - Room 12: 9\n   - Current room: 12\n   - Unvisited set: {3, 15}\n\n6. Once we have visited the destination room (room 12), we can backtrack from it to the initial room (room 1) to find the shortest path. We do this by following the path of lowest cumulative distance back to the initial room. Here is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12:\n   - Room 1, Room 7, Room 4, Room 6, Room 9, Room 12\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: Answer: 1, 7, 4, 6, 9, 12"
