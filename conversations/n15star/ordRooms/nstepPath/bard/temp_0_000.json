The shortest path from room 1 to room 6 is:  1, 7, 10, 13, 6 Here are the steps involved in finding the shortest path:  We start at room 1 and add it to the path. We look at the rooms that are connected to room 1, and add the shortest of those rooms to the path. In this case, the shortest room is room 7. We repeat step 2, but this time we start with room 7. The shortest room that is connected to room 7 is room 10. We repeat step 2 again, but this time we start with room 10. The shortest room that is connected to room 10 is room 13. Finally, we repeat step 2 one last time, but this time we start with room 13. The shortest room that is connected to room 13 is room 6. The path is complete, and we have found the shortest path from room 1 to room 6. The path is 1, 7, 10, 13, 6.  Answer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 6. Let me know if you have any other questions."
