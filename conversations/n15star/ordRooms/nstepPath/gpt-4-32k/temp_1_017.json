Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. None of these can reach room 4.\n   - From room 11, we can reach room 2. Room 2 is connected to room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 8 was already explored, and rooms 5, 11, and 14 do not connect to room 4.\nStep 5: No direct or indirect connections were found between room 5 and room 4 in the given description.\n\nAnswer: There is no available path to go from room 5 to room 4 according to the given information."
