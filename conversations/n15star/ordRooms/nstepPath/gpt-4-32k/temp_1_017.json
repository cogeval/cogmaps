If not, proceed to find which rooms are connected to these rooms.\nStep 4: Check Room 7 connections (Room 1, Room 4, Room 10, Room 13) - No direct connection to Room 12.\nStep 5: Check Room 10 connections (Room 1, Room 7, Room 13) - No direct connection to Room 12.\nStep 6: Check Room 13 connections (Room 1, Room 7, Room 10, Room 4) - No direct connection to Room 12.\nStep 7: Check Room 11 connections (Room 1, Room 2, Room 5, Room 8, Room 14) - No direct connection to Room 12.\nStep 8: Since no direct connection was found in the previous steps, we have to check the connected rooms of these connected rooms.\nStep 9: Check Room 7 and Room 13's shared connections (Room 4 and Room 10) - No direct connection to Room 12.\nStep 10: Check Room 11's connections - Room 8 (which is connected to Room 3 and Room 12).\n\nThus, the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 12 is 1 -> 11 -> 8 -> 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8, 12"
