The rooms connected to room 1 are room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11.\n3. Check each connected room to see if room 12 is directly connected or if it is connected through another room.\n4. Room 7 is connected to room 10 and room 13 (not room 12)\n5. Room 10 is connected to room 13 (not room 12)\n6. Room 13 is not connected to room 12\n7. Room 11 is connected to room 14 (not room 12)\n8. Room 14 is not connected to room 12\n9. Going back to the first set of connected rooms, room 7 is also connected to room 1 and room 4 (not room 12)\n10. Room 4 is connected to room 10 and room 13 (not room 12)\n11. Based on the information provided, the only room connected to room 12 is room 9.\n12. Room 9 is connected to room 3 and room 6 (not room 12)\n13. Room 3 is connected to room 6 (not room 12)\n14. Room 6 is connected to room 9 (not room 12)\n15. Since room 12 is not directly connected to any of the other rooms except for room 9, we must go through room 9 to reach room 12.\n16. The shortest path will go from room 1 to room 7, room 7 to room 10, room 10 to room 13, room 13 to room 4, room 4 to room 7, room 7 to room 1, room 1 to room 11, room 11 to room 14, room 14 to room 8, room 8 to room 9, and finally from room 9 to room 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 7, 1, 11, 14, 8, 9, 12"
