Room 8 connects to room 3, room 3 connects to room 6, and room 6 connects to room 15. Path: 14 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3 -> 6 -> 15 (6 steps)\n   - From room 11: room 11 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 5, and 14. The closest to room 15 is room 1, which connects to room 4. Room 4 connects to room 15 directly. Path: 14 -> 11 -> 1 -> 4 -> 15 (4 steps)\nStep 4: Choose the shortest path found in step 3.\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 1, 4, 15"
