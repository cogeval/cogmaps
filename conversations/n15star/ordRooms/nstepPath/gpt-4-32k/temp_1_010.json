It is connected to rooms 1, 2, 5, and 14.\nStep 3: Determine the shortest path from each of these connected rooms to room 15.\n  - From room 1, we have connections to 7, 10, 13, and 11. None of these are directly connected to room 15.\n  - From room 2, we have connections to 5, 8, 11, and 14. None of these are directly connected to room 15.\n  - From room 5, we have connections to 8, 11, and 14. None of these are directly connected to room 15.\n  - From room 14, we have connections to 2, 5, 8, and 11. None of these are directly connected to room 15.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the next level of connections.\n  - From room 1, we have connections to 7, 10, and 13. Room 4 is connected to 7, 10, and 13, so the path is 11-1-4.\n  - From room 14, we have connections to 2, 5, and 8. Room 3 is connected to 8, so the path is 11-14-3.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the next level of connections.\n  - From room 4, it's connected to 7, 10, 13, and 15. Room 15 is directly connected, so the path is 11-1-4-15.\n  - From room 3, it's connected to 6, 9, 12, and 8. Room 6 is connected to 15, so the path is 11-14-3-6-15.\n\nStep 6: Determine the shortest path. \n  - Path 11-1-4-15 has 4 rooms in the sequence.\n  - Path 11-14-3-6-15 has 5 rooms in the sequence.\n\nAnswer: 11, 1, 4, 15"
