Chapman and Hall/CRC Statistical Engineering Series (2010)\nThe book gives many examples which is very helpful for practicing exercises in BUGS! The first few chapters give a solid theoretical background for all statistical software. Chapter 8 gives one of the most complete treatment on Bayesian inference through an easy to read example with explanation throughout the example. I'm not very good at programming but this example got me to work on BUGS. The examples in the second half of the book use the R system.
