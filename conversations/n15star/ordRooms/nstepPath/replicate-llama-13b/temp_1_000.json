Here are the steps:\n\n- Create a list of all and mark their distances as infinity except for the starting room (room 1), which will have a of.\n- Set up a priority queue with the initial state being just room 1.\n- Loop until every node has been visited or we reach our destination (room 12):\n\t- Pop off the lowest-cost item in our priority queue. This will be our current node.\n\t- If we've reached our destination, construct and return the path that led us here.\n\t-, look at all adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet\t  - Calculate tentative distances to these nodes through our current node: sum of cost so far plus cost to move from current node to this adjacent one\n\t  - Update stored values for any nodes whose tentative distance is lower than before\n\t  - Add any new/unvisited/updated nodes to priority queue\n\nUsing Dijkstra, we can see that the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 12 is: 'Answer: 1,7,10,13,15,12'"
