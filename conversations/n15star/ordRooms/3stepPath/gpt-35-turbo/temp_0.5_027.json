Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to room 2 and infinity to all other rooms. Set room 2 as the current room.\n2. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distance values. The tentative distance to a neighbor is the sum of the current room's distance and the distance between the current room and the neighbor.\n3. If a neighbor's tentative distance is less than its current distance value, update the neighbor's distance value to the tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. From the list of unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest distance value and set it as the new current room. If there are no more unvisited rooms or if the smallest distance value is infinity, stop.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the destination room (room 13) is visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 2 to room 13 is:\n\n2, 11, 7, 13\n\nAnswer: 2, 11, 7, 13"
