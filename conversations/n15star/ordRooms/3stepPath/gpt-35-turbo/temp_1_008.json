            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to all rooms, set to infinity for all rooms except room 1, which is set to 0. Create a set of unvisited rooms, initially containing all rooms.\n```\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: inf\nRoom 3: inf\nRoom 4: inf\nRoom 5: inf\nRoom 6: inf\nRoom 7: inf\nRoom 8: inf\nRoom 9: inf\nRoom 10: inf\nRoom 11: inf\nRoom 12: inf\nRoom 13: inf\nRoom 14: inf\nRoom 15: inf\n\nUnvisited set: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}\n```\n\n2. For the current room (initially room 1), consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighboring room is the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge connecting the two rooms. The weight of an edge is 1 if the two rooms are directly connected, and 2 if there is an intermediate room between them. In this case, we will denote an intermediate room with parentheses. For example, the weight of the edge between room 1 and room 7 is 1, and the weight of the edge between room 1 and room 11 is 2, because we need to go through room 7 to get to room 11. After calculating the tentative distances, we update the distance values of the neighboring rooms if the tentative distance is smaller than their current distance value.\n\n```\nConsider neighbors of room 1:\n\nRoom 1 -> Room 7: distance = 1\nRoom 1 -> Room 10: distance = 1\nRoom 1 -> Room 13: distance = 1\nRoom 1 -> Room 11: distance = 2\nRoom 1 -> Room 2: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 3: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 4: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 5: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 6: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 8: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 9: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 12: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 14: distance = inf\nRoom 1 -> Room 15: distance = inf\n\nUpdate neighboring room distances:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 2\nRoom 13: 1\n```\n\n3. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. In this case, we choose room 7 as the current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n\n```\nVisited set: {1}\nUnvisited set: {2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}\nCurrent room: 7\n```\n\n4. Repeat step 2 for the current room (room 7). Calculate the tentative distances to its neighboring rooms and update their distance values if necessary.\n\n```\nConsider neighbors of room 7:\n\nRoom 7 -> Room 1: distance = 1\nRoom 7 -> Room 4: distance = 1\nRoom 7 -> Room 10: distance = 1\nRoom 7 -> Room 13: distance = 1\nRoom 7 -> Room 11: distance = 2\nRoom 7 -> Room 2: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 5: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 8: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 14: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 3: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 6: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 9: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 12: distance = inf\nRoom 7 -> Room 15: distance = inf\n\nUpdate neighboring room distances:\n\nRoom 1: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 2\nRoom 13: 1\n```\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, choosing the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the current room, until we reach the destination room (room 15) or there are no more unvisited rooms. In this case, the next current room is room 13, then room 4, then room 15.\n\n```\nVisited set: {1,7,13,4,15}\nUnvisited set: {2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,14}\nCurrent room: 15\n\nConsider neighbors of room 15:\n\nRoom 15 -> Room 13: distance = 1\nRoom 15 -> Room 4: distance = 1\nRoom 15 -> Room 10: distance = 2\nRoom 15 -> Room 7: distance = 2\nRoom 15 -> Room 1: distance = 3\nRoom 15 -> Room 11: distance = 3\nRoom 15 -> Room 14: distance = 1\nRoom 15 -> Room 2: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 3: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 5: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 6: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 8: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 9: distance = inf\nRoom 15 -> Room 12: distance = inf\n\nUpdate neighboring room distances:\n\nRoom 1: 3\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 7: 2\nRoom 10: 2\nRoom 11: 3\nRoom 13: 1\nRoom 15: 0\n\nShortest path: 1, 7, 13, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 15"
