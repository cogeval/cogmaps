Both have a distance of 2 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 13, we can reach room 4, which has a distance of 2 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 2, we can reach room 14, which has a distance of 3 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 5, we can reach room 8, which has a distance of 3 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 8, we can reach room 14, which has a distance of 4 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 4, we can reach room 15, which has a distance of 3 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 14, we can reach room 15, which has a distance of 5 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 9, we can reach room 12, which has a distance of 3 from room 1. \n\nFrom room 6, we can reach room 15, which has a distance of 4 from room 1. \n\nSo the shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is:\n\n1, 7, 4, 15 \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 15"
