Set the distance to room 13 to 0 and the distance to all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Consider the rooms connected to room 13: rooms 1, 4, and 7. Update their distances to reflect the distance from room 13 plus the distance to each room: room 1 has a distance of 1, room 4 has a distance of 1, and room 7 has a distance of 1.\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance from the starting room that has not yet been visited. In this case, that is room 1.\n4. Consider the rooms connected to room 1 that have not yet been visited: rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13. Update their distances to reflect the distance from room 1 plus the distance to each room: room 7 has a distance of 2, room 10 has a distance of 2, room 11 has a distance of 2, and room 13 still has a distance of 0.\n5. Choose the room with the smallest distance from the starting room that has not yet been visited. In this case, that is room 7.\n6. Consider the rooms connected to room 7 that have not yet been visited: rooms 10 and 13. Update their distances to reflect the distance from room 7 plus the distance to each room: room 10 has a distance of 3 and room 13 still has a distance of 0.\n7. Choose the room with the smallest distance from the starting room that has not yet been visited. In this case, that is room 10.\n8. Consider the rooms connected to room 10 that have not yet been visited: room 13. Update its distance to reflect the distance from room 10 plus the distance to the room: room 13 has a distance of 4.\n9. Choose the room with the smallest distance from the starting room that has not yet been visited. In this case, that is room 13.\n10. Since we have reached our destination, room 6, we can stop. The shortest path from room 13 to room 6 is: 13, 10, 6.\n\nAnswer: 13, 10, 6"
