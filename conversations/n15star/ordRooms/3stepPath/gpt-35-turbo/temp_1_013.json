Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to the starting node (room 10), and infinity to all other nodes. Set the starting node as the current node.\n\n2. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance from the starting node to that neighbor. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance value of the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance value.\n\n3. Mark the current node as visited.\n\n4. If the destination node (room 12) has been visited, stop. The shortest path has been found.\n\n5. Otherwise, select the unvisited node with the smallest distance value as the next current node. Go back to step 2.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 10 to room 12 as: 10, 13, 7, 4, 15, 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 10, 13, 7, 4, 15, 12."
