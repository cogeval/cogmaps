Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, and Visited. Initially, set the distance of all rooms to infinity and Visited to False, except for room 2 which should have a distance of 0.\n\n2. Starting from room 2, calculate the distance to all adjacent rooms (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n3. Mark room 2 as Visited.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 5 with a distance of 1.\n\n5. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 8, 11, and 14). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n6. Mark room 5 as Visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 8 with a distance of 2.\n\n8. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 11 and 14). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n9. Mark room 8 as Visited.\n\n10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 11 with a distance of 3.\n\n11. Calculate the distance to all adjacent unvisited rooms (rooms 14 and 6). Update the Distance column in the table accordingly.\n\n12. Mark room 11 as Visited.\n\n13. Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 6 with a distance of 4.\n\n14. The shortest path from room 2 to room 6 is: 2, 8, 11, 6.\n\nAnswer: 2, 8, 11, 6."
