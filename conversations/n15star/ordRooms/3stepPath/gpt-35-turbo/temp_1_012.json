Assign a tentative distance of zero to room 10 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 10 and create a set of unvisited rooms.\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate its tentative distance from room 10 as the sum of the distance from the current room and the distance to the adjacent room. If this tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to the adjacent room, update the adjacent room's distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n5. If the set of unvisited rooms is empty or room 9 has been marked visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the set of unvisited rooms is empty or room 9 has been marked visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 10 to room 9 is:\n\nAnswer: 10, 13, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9."
