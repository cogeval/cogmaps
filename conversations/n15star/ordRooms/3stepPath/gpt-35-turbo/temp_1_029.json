Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 5 to each room in the castle. Initialize the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 5, which has a distance of 0. We'll also create another table to keep track of the previous room in the shortest path to each room.\n\n| Room | Distance | Previous Room |\n|------|----------|---------------|\n|  1   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  2   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  3   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  4   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  5   |    0     |      N/A      |\n|  6   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  7   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  8   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  9   |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  10  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  11  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  12  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  13  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  14  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n|  15  |   inf    |      N/A      |\n\n2.
