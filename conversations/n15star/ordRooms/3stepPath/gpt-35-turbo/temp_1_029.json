We update the distances of its neighboring rooms as follows:\n- Room 1: 0\n- Room 2: 2\n- Room 3: 2\n- Room 4: 2\n- Room 5: infinity\n- Room 6: infinity\n- Room 7: 1\n- Room 8: infinity\n- Room 9: infinity\n- Room 10: 1\n- Room 11: 1\n- Room 12: infinity\n- Room 13: 1\n- Room 14: infinity\n- Room 15: infinity\n\nWe continue this process until we reach room 15. The final distances are:\n- Room 1: 0\n- Room 2: 2\n- Room 3: 2\n- Room 4: 2\n- Room 5: 3\n- Room 6: 3\n- Room 7: 1\n- Room 8: 3\n- Room 9: 4\n- Room 10: 1\n- Room 11: 1\n- Room 12: 4\n- Room 13: 1\n- Room 14: 2\n- Room 15: 3\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is therefore: 1, 10, 13, 15. \n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 13, 15."
