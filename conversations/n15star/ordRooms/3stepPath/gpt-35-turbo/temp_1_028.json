Then, we explore the neighboring rooms of room 5 and update their distances if a shorter path is found. We repeat this process until we reach room 6. \n\nHere are the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm:\n1. Set distance to room 5 as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n2. Set the unvisited set to contain all rooms.\n3. While the unvisited set is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Find the room in the unvisited set with the smallest distance, and mark it as visited.\n   b. For each neighboring room that is still in the unvisited set, calculate the distance from the starting room (room 5) to that room through the current room. If this distance is less than the previously assigned distance to that room, update the distance.\n4. When we reach room 6, we have found the shortest path from room 5 to room 6.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 5 to room 6 is:\n5, 8, 12, 6\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 5, 8, 12, 6"
