Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 2 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set room 2 as the current room.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room (room 2) to that neighboring room. This distance is the sum of the tentative distance of the current room and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room.\n4. If the calculated distance is less than the tentative distance of the neighboring room, update the tentative distance of the neighboring room to the calculated distance.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. If the destination room (room 9) has been visited, stop the algorithm and output the shortest path. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 2 to room 9 is:\n\n2 -> 8 -> 9\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 2, 8, 9"
