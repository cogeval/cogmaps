From room 10, we can reach room 4 in one step. From room 4, we can reach room 13 in one step or room 7 in one step. However, reaching room 13 again will result in a cycle, so we should avoid it. Therefore, we choose to go to room 7. From room 7, we can reach room 4 in one step and then reach room 15 in one step. From room 15, we can reach room 12 in one step. \n\nSo the shortest path from room 13 to room 12 is: 13, 10, 4, 7, 15, 12.\n\nAnswer: 13, 10, 4, 7, 15, 12."
