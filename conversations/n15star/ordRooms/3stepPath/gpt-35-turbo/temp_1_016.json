From room 7, we can reach room 4 with a distance of 1, which is adjacent to room 15 with a distance of 1, and then to room 14 with a distance of 1. So the total distance from room 13 to room 14 through this path is 3.\n\nStarting from room 10, we can reach room 7 with a distance of 1, and then follow the same path as above to reach room 14. So the total distance from room 13 to room 14 through this path is also 3.\n\nTherefore, there are two shortest paths from room 13 to room 14:\n1. 13, 7, 4, 15, 14\n2. 13, 10, 7, 4, 15, 14\n\nAnswer: 13, 7, 4, 15, 14 OR 13, 10, 7, 4, 15, 14"
