Assign all other rooms a tentative distance of infinity.\n2. From room 11, consider all neighboring rooms (rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14). Calculate the distance from room 11 to each neighbor and update their tentative distances accordingly. The distances are: room 2 (infinity), room 5 (infinity), room 8 (infinity), room 14 (infinity).\n3. Choose the room with the smallest tentative distance (which is room 14 with a tentative distance of infinity) and repeat step 2 for all of its neighbors.\n4. Continue this process of choosing the room with the smallest tentative distance and updating distances for its neighbors until you reach room 4.\n5. Once you reach room 4, the shortest path from room 11 to room 4 is the path that follows the rooms with the lowest total distance. This path is: 11, 2, 8, 4.\n\nAnswer: 11, 2, 8, 4."
