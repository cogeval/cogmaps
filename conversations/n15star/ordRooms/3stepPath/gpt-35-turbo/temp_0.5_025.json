Create a table with all the rooms as rows and the distance from room 1 as columns. Initialize the distance from room 1 to itself as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | \u221e                    |\n| 3    | \u221e                    |\n| 4    | \u221e                    |\n| 5    | \u221e                    |\n| 6    | \u221e                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | \u221e                    |\n| 9    | \u221e                    |\n| 10   | 1                    |\n| 11   | 1                    |\n| 12   | \u221e                    |\n| 13   | 1                    |\n| 14   | \u221e                    |\n| 15   | \u221e                    |\n\n2. Mark room 1 as visited and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 7, 10, 11, 13) to 1.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | \u221e                    |\n| 3    | \u221e                    |\n| 4    | \u221e                    |\n| 5    | \u221e                    |\n| 6    | \u221e                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | \u221e                    |\n| 9    | \u221e                    |\n| 10   | 1                    |\n| 11   | 1                    |\n| 12   | \u221e                    |\n| 13   | 1                    |\n| 14   | \u221e                    |\n| 15   | \u221e                    |\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 1 (room 7) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 1, 10, 11, 13) to 2.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | \u221e                    |\n| 3    | \u221e                    |\n| 4    | \u221e                    |\n| 5    | \u221e                    |\n| 6    | \u221e                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | \u221e                    |\n| 9    | \u221e                    |\n| 10   | 1                    |\n| 11   | 1                    |\n| 12   | \u221e                    |\n| 13   | 1                    |\n| 14   | \u221e                    |\n| 15   | \u221e                    |\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until all rooms are visited. The final table will be:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | 3                    |\n| 3    | 4                    |\n| 4    | 3                    |\n| 5    | 4                    |\n| 6    | 5                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | 5                    |\n| 9    | 6                    |\n| 10   | 1                    |\n| 11   | 1                    |\n| 12   | 5                    |\n| 13   | 1                    |\n| 14   | 2                    |\n| 15   | 4                    |\n\n5. The shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is 1-10-13-15. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,10,13,15"
