Mark room 2 as the starting point and assign a tentative distance of 0 to it. Mark all other rooms as unvisited and assign a tentative distance of infinity to them.\n2. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 2: rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14. Calculate the tentative distance from room 2 to each of these rooms, which is 1 for each since they are directly connected to room 2.\n3. Mark room 2 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 5 with a distance of 1. Move to room 5.\n4. From room 5, look at all the unvisited rooms that are directly connected to it: rooms 8, 11, and 14. Calculate the tentative distance to these rooms by adding 1 to the distance from room 2 to room 5 (which is 1), giving a tentative distance of 2 for each of these rooms.\n5. Mark room 5 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 8 with a distance of 2. Move to room 8.\n6. From room 8, look at all the unvisited rooms that are directly connected to it: room 14. Calculate the tentative distance to room 14 by adding 1 to the distance from room 2 to room 5 to room 8 (which is 2), giving a tentative distance of 3 for room 14.\n7. Mark room 8 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 11 with a distance of 3. Move to room 11.\n8. From room 11, look at all the unvisited rooms that are directly connected to it: room 14 and room 2. Calculate the tentative distance to room 14 by adding 1 to the distance from room 2 to room 5 to room 8 to room 11 (which is 3), giving a tentative distance of 4 for room 14. Calculate the tentative distance to room 2 by adding 1 to the distance from room 2 to room 11 (which is 1), giving a tentative distance of 2 for room 2.\n9. Mark room 11 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 2 with a distance of 2. Move to room 2.\n10. Since room 7 is directly connected to room 2 with a distance of 2, we have found the shortest path from room 2 to room 7. The path is: 2, 11, 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 2, 11, 7."
