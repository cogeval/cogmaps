Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark room 1 as visited and set it as the current room.\n3. For each of the rooms connected to the current room, calculate the distance from the current room to that room. If the calculated distance is less than the tentative distance assigned to that room, update the tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room and repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination room (room 15) is visited.\n6. Backtrack from room 15 to room 1 using the tentative distances to determine the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is:\n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
