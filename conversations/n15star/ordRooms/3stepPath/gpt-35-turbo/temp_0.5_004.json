Check its adjacent rooms: room 10 and room 13.\n3. Add room 10 and room 13 to the queue.\n4. Take the first room from the queue: room 10.\n5. Check its adjacent rooms: room 7, room 13, room 4, and room 11.\n6. Skip room 7 since we have already visited it.\n7. Add room 13, room 4, and room 11 to the queue.\n8. Take the next room from the queue: room 13.\n9. Check its adjacent rooms: room 7, room 10, room 4, and room 11.\n10. Skip room 7 and room 10 since we have already visited them.\n11. Add room 4 and room 11 to the queue.\n12. Take the next room from the queue: room 4.\n13. Check its adjacent rooms: room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15.\n14. Skip room 7, room 10, and room 13 since we have already visited them.\n15. Add room 15 to the queue.\n16. Take the next room from the queue: room 11.\n17. Check its adjacent rooms: room 7, room 10, room 14, and room 5.\n18. Skip room 7 and room 10 since we have already visited them.\n19. Add room 14 and room 5 to the queue.\n20.
