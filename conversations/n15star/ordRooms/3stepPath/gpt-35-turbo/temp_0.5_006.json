Check the adjacent rooms: room 10 and room 13.\n3. Add room 10 and room 13 to the queue.\n4. Check the next room in the queue: room 10.\n5. Check the adjacent rooms of room 10: room 7, room 13, and room 4.\n6. Since room 7 and room 13 are already visited, we add room 4 to the queue.\n7. Check the next room in the queue: room 13.\n8. Check the adjacent rooms of room 13: room 7, room 10, and room 1.\n9. Since room 7 and room 10 are already visited, we add room 1 to the queue.\n10. Check the next room in the queue: room 4.\n11. Check the adjacent rooms of room 4: room 7, room 10, and room 15.\n12. Since room 7 and room 10 are already visited, we add room 15 to the queue.\n13. Check the next room in the queue: room 1.\n14. Check the adjacent rooms of room 1: room 7, room 10, room 13, room 11.\n15. Since room 7, room 10, and room 13 are already visited, we add room 11 to the queue.\n16. Check the next room in the queue: room 15.\n17. Check the adjacent rooms of room 15: room 4, room 6, and room 9.\n18. Since room 9 is adjacent to room 15, we have found the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 7 to room 9 is 7, 10, 13, 1, 11, 14, 8, 9.\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 1, 11, 14, 8, 9."
