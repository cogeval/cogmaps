Since the castle's structure can be represented as a graph, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the shortest path.\n\nStarting from room 7, we can reach rooms 10, 13, and 11. We will add these rooms to the search queue, marking 7 as visited.\n\nNext, we will explore room 10. From room 10, we can only reach room 13. We will add room 13 to the search queue.\n\nNow, we will explore room 13. From room 13, we can reach room 11, which is our target room. We will return the path: 7, 10, 13, 11.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 7 to room 2 is:\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 2"
