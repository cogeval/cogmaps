The neighboring rooms of room 13 are room 1, room 4, and room 7\n3. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 1: distance of 3\n   - Room 4: distance of 2\n   - Room 7: distance of 1\n4. Choose the neighboring room with the shortest distance, which is room 7\n5. Move to room 7 and mark it as visited\n6. The neighboring rooms of room 7 are room 1, room 4, and room 10\n7. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 1: distance of 4 (3 from room 13 to room 7 + 1 from room 7 to room 1)\n   - Room 4: distance of 3 (2 from room 13 to room 4 + 1 from room 4 to room 7)\n   - Room 10: distance of 2 (1 from room 13 to room 7 + 1 from room 7 to room 10)\n8. Choose the neighboring room with the shortest distance, which is room 10\n9. Move to room 10 and mark it as visited\n10. The neighboring rooms of room 10 are room 4 and room 13\n11.

The neighboring rooms of room 13 are room 1, room 4, and room 10 (already visited)\n15. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 1: distance of 4 (3 from room 13 to room 7 + 1 from room 7 to room 1)\n   - Room 4: distance of 5 (3 from room 13 to room 7 + 2 from room 7 to room 4)\n16.

The neighboring rooms of room 1 are room 7 and room 10 (both already visited) and room 11\n19. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 7: distance of 5 (3 from room 13 to room 7 + 2 from room 7 to room 1)\n   - Room 10: distance of 4 (1 from room 13 to room 7 + 2 from room 7 to room 10 + 1 from room 10 to room 1)\n   - Room 11: distance of 3 (1 from room 13 to room 11 + 2 from room 11 to room 1)\n20.

Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 2: distance of 6 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 3 from room 11 to room 2)\n   - Room 5: distance of 5 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 2 from room 11 to room 5)\n   - Room 14: distance of 4 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 1 from room 11 to room 14)\n24.

The neighboring rooms of room 5 are room 8, room 11, and room 14 (already visited)\n27. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 8: distance of 7 (3 from room 13 to room 5 + 2 from room 5 to room 8 + 2 from room 8 to room 14)\n   - Room 11: distance of 4 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 1 from room 11 to room 5)\n   - Room 14: distance of 5 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 2 from room 11 to room 14)\n28. Choose the neighboring room with the shortest distance, which is room 11\n29. Move to room 11 and mark it as visited\n30. The neighboring rooms of room 11 are room 2 and room 14 (both already visited)\n31. Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 2: distance of 7 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 3 from room 11 to room 2 + 1 from room 2 to room 5)\n   - Room 14: distance of 6 (3 from room 13 to room 11 + 1 from room 11 to room 14 + 2 from room 14 to room 5)\n32.

Calculate the distance from room 13 to each neighboring room:\n   - Room 8: distance of 9 (3 from room 13 to room 5 + 2 from room 5 to room 8 + 4 from room 8 to room 14)\n36. Choose the neighboring room with the shortest distance, which is room 8\n37. Move to room 8 and mark it as visited\n38. The neighboring rooms of room 8 are not connected to room 5 (dead end)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 13 to room 5 is: 13, 11, 5.\n\nAnswer: 13, 11, 5"
