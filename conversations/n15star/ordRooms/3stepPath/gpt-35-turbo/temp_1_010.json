            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 10 to room 14, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 10 and infinity to all other rooms. Set the initial room as the current room (which is room 10 in this case).\n2. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances (which is the distance from the starting room to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighboring room). For example, room 10 is connected to room 13, so the tentative distance to room 13 would be 1 (since it's 1 room away from room 10).\n3. Among all the neighboring rooms, select the one with the smallest tentative distance and make it the new current room. In case of a tie, choose any of them. For example, since room 13 is the only neighbor of room 10, it becomes the new current room.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the new current room until you reach room 14. At each step, update the tentative distances of the neighboring rooms if a shorter path is found.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 10 to room 14 is:\n\n10, 11, 14\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 10, 11, 14"
