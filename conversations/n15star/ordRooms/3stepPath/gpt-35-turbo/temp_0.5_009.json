Create a table with each room as a row and columns for \"Visited\", \"Distance\", and \"Previous Room\". Set the distance for room 1 to 0 and all other distances to infinity. Set \"Visited\" to false for all rooms and \"Previous Room\" to null for all rooms.\n\n2. Starting with room 1, visit the unvisited room with the smallest distance. For each neighboring room that is unvisited, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the two rooms. If this distance is less than the current distance for that neighboring room, update the distance and previous room in the table.\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until room 15 is visited.\n\n4. To find the shortest path, start at room 15 and follow the \"Previous Room\" column in the table back to room 1.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
