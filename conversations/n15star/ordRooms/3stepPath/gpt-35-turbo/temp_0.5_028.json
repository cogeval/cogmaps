The shortest path to room 6 will be the one with the smallest distance.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following distances from room 5 to each room:\n\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 8: 1\nRoom 11: 1\nRoom 14: 1\nRoom 2: 2\nRoom 7: 2\nRoom 10: 2\nRoom 1: 3\nRoom 13: 3\nRoom 4: 3\nRoom 15: 3\nRoom 6: 3\nRoom 9: 4\nRoom 3: 5\nRoom 12: 6\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 5 to room 6 is:\n\n5, 8, 11, 14, 6\n\nAnswer: 5, 8, 11, 14, 6"
