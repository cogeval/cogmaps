First, I will create a table to keep track of the distances from room 2 to all other rooms, initially setting all distances to infinity except the distance to room 2 itself, which is 0. Then, I will iterate through the rooms, updating the distance to neighboring rooms if a shorter path is found. Finally, I will trace back the shortest path from room 6 to room 2 using the updated table.\n\nHere's the updated table for the distances:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 2 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | Infinity             |\n| 3    | Infinity             |\n| 4    | Infinity             |\n| 5    | 1                    |\n| 6    | 2                    |\n| 7    | Infinity             |\n| 8    | 1                    |\n| 9    | Infinity             |\n| 10   | Infinity             |\n| 11   | 1                    |\n| 12   | Infinity             |\n| 13   | Infinity             |\n| 14   | 2                    |\n| 15   | Infinity             |\n\nFollowing the path from room 6 to room 2 using the updated table, the shortest path is:\n6, 3, 8, 5, 2\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 2 to room 6, including room 2 and room 6, is:\n2, 5, 8, 3, 6\n\nAnswer: 2, 5, 8, 3, 6"
