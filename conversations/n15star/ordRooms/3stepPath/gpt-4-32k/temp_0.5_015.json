Room 7 connects to room 4, which does not lead to room 15.\n4. Room 10 connects to rooms 13 and 7, but room 7 does not lead to room 15.\n5. Room 13 connects to rooms 1, 4, 7, and 10, which do not lead to room 15.\n6. Room 11 connects to rooms 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n7. Room 2 does not lead to room 15.\n8. Room 5 connects to rooms 2, 8, 11, and 14.\n9. Room 8 connects to rooms 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, and 14.\n10. Room 14 connects to rooms 5, 8, 11, and 15.\n11.
