Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The order would be (,1,7,9,12) which reduces to 1,7,9,11,12  since there is no room 15 in the given arrangement. This yields the most reward (50 + 10 + 0 + 15 + 0 = 75), and cannot improve given room 1 is fixed in your path. A sub-optimal solution is to take the path of rooms 1, 3, and 5, followed by visiting room 9 which will give you the first reward of 10 and no additional rewards given your restrictions. This would give your final reward as (3,5,9,10 + 0 = 15, in which room 5 acts as the penultimate visited room and none of the rooms revisits). Another sub-optimal solution is to take the path of rooms 1 and 7, followed by 9. Your final outcome in that case, with a reward of (10,7, 9 + 0 = 19, in which none of the two rooms prior to room 1 are revisited), yields fewer rewards than those given above, provided an upper boundary of 75 in rewards given the restriction, as both solutions cannot return to rooms 1  or 7 later along the way). A further exploration into sub-optimal paths (1,5,7,9 and 10) do not yield any additional reward while still visiting all the said rooms in an intended order. After a lengthy exploration of possible solutions we reach the optimal solution mentioned, and thus can confirm this answer. 3BM (9), as such : (;1,5,3;0:,7 31,15. From 7 1,1, and from 1 9,5. Thus the first solution yields (1,5,7 9, in which rooms 5 and 7 are penultimate on a unique optimal path."
