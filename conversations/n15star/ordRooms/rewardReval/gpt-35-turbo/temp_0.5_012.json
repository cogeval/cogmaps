Create a graph with 15 nodes representing each room, and edges connecting rooms that are connected to each other.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge, except for the edge between room 1 and room 7, which has a weight of 0 (since we don't want to count the reward for visiting room 1).\n3. Initialize a distance array with all values set to infinity, except for the distance to room 1, which is set to 0.\n4. Initialize a visited array with all values set to false.\n5. Repeat the following steps until all nodes have been visited:\n   a. Find the node with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet.\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance to that neighbor as the sum of the distance to the current node and the weight of the edge between them.\n   c. If this distance is smaller than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance and set the previous node of the neighbor to be the current node.\n   d. Mark the current node as visited.\n6. Once all nodes have been visited, backtrack from room 14 to room 1 using the previous node array to find the optimal path.\n7. Return the optimal path as a list of room numbers.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 11, 14"
