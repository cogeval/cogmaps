However, since there are 15 rooms and each room is connected to multiple other rooms, this could be a time-consuming task to do manually. \n\nOne way to approach this problem is to use a graph algorithm called Dijkstra's algorithm, which can efficiently find the shortest path between two points in a graph. In our case, we can modify this algorithm to find the path that yields the most reward from room 1 to room 14.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can assign each room a weight equal to the reward for visiting it (or 0 if there is no reward). Then, we can compute the shortest paths from room 1 to all other rooms based on these weights. Finally, we can select the path from room 1 to room 14 with the highest cumulative weight.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the castle described above, the path from room 1 that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 11, 14"
