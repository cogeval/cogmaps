Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, the algorithm would explore all possible paths and calculate the total reward for each path. The algorithm would then return the shortest path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's Algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nThe total reward for this path is 50, which comes from visiting room 8. Note that although there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15, it is not part of the path since the reward of 50 from room 8 is higher and we can only collect the reward once.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"

Although the reward of 12 in room 8 is not as high as the reward of 48 in room 15, visiting room 8 would result in a longer path with a lower total reward.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
