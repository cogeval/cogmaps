Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can visit room 8 first to get the reward of 50, then visit room 11 to get the reward of 0, and finally visit room 14 to get the reward of 0. Alternatively, we can visit room 15 first to get the reward of 10, then visit room 12 to get the reward of 0, and finally visit room 6 to get the reward of 0. Both paths have a total distance of 4. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is either 1, 8, 11, 14 or 1, 15, 12, 6.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 11, 14 or 1, 15, 12, 6."
