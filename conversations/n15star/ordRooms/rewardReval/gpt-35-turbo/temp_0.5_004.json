Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize the distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 1 which is 0. Also, initialize the visited set to empty.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance from the current room to that neighboring room. If the distance is less than the current distance of that neighboring room, update its distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Among the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest distance as the next current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all rooms have been visited or the current room is room 8 or room 15.\n7. If the current room is room 8 or room 15, backtrack from that room to room 1 using the recorded distances. Choose the room with the highest reward.\n\nBased on the given connections and rewards, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
