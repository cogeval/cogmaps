Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The shortest path to Room 15 is through Room 6, which has a reward of 0. Therefore, we can skip Room 15 as well. \n\nNext, we can explore the paths to the rooms with rewards. The shortest path to Room 8 is through Room 11, which has a reward of 0. The shortest path to Room 15 is through Room 6, which has a reward of 0. Therefore, the optimal path is to visit Room 8 first and then Room 15. \n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is: 1, 11, 8, 6, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8, 6, 15."

The shortest path to Room 15 is through Room 6, which has a reward of 0. \n\nThe reward for Room 8 is now higher than the reward for Room 15, so we should visit Room 8 first.
