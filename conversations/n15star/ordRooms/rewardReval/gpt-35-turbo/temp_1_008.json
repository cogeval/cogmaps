Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. First, we assign a distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1, which we assign a distance of 0. Then, we visit all neighboring rooms of room 1 and update their distances to the value of the reward if there is a chest, or to the sum of the distance from room 1 and the distance to that neighboring room otherwise. We mark room 1 as visited and repeat the process with the unvisited room with the smallest distance until we reach room 8 or room 15.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can visit room 7, which has a distance of 1 from room 1 and a reward of 0. Then, we can visit room 10, which has a distance of 1 from room 7 and a reward of 0. From there, we can visit room 13, which has a distance of 1 from room 10 and a reward of 0. Finally, we can visit room 15, which has a distance of 2 from room 13 and a reward of 10. This yields a total reward of 10, which is the maximum reward that can be obtained starting from room 1.\n\nTherefore, the order of the rooms starting from room 1, including room 1, to yield the most reward is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"

Then, we can visit room 10, which has a distance of 1 from room 7 and a reward of 0. From there, we can visit room 13, which has a distance of 1 from room 10 and a reward of 0.
