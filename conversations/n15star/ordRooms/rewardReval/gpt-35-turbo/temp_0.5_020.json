Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13, all of which are not connected to room 8 or room 15. Therefore, we need to explore one of these rooms to reach either room 8 or room 15. \n\nLet's explore room 10 first. From room 10, we can reach room 13, which is connected to room 15. Therefore, we can collect the reward of 10 from room 15. However, we cannot reach room 8 from room 10. \n\nNext, let's explore room 7. From room 7, we can reach room 10, which we already explored, and room 13, which leads to room 15. Therefore, we can collect the reward of 10 from room 15. We can also reach room 4 from room 7, which is connected to room 15. However, we cannot reach room 8 from room 7. \n\nNow, let's explore room 11. From room 11, we can reach room 14, which is connected to room 8. Therefore, we can collect the reward of 50 from room 8. However, we cannot reach room 15 from room 11. \n\nFinally, let's explore room 13. From room 13, we can reach room 15, which we already explored, and room 10, which we already explored. Therefore, exploring room 13 does not give us any additional information. \n\nBased on the above analysis, the shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 7 and goes to room 15 to collect the reward of 10. Therefore, the answer is: 1,7,13,15."
