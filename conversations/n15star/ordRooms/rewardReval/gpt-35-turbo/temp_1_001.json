            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward from room 1, we need to use a search algorithm that takes into account the reward of each room. One such algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. We start at room 1, which has no reward.\n2. We visit the rooms connected to room 1: rooms 7, 10, 11, 13.\n3. We update the reward of each room based on the reward of the previous room plus the reward of the current room. The rewards for these rooms are: room 7: 0, room 10: 0, room 11: 0, room 13: 0.\n4. We add the rooms to a priority queue based on their reward, with the highest reward being the highest priority. So, we add room 13, room 10, room 11, and room 7 to the queue.\n5. We repeat the process with the room that has the highest reward in the queue, which is room 13. We visit the rooms connected to room 13: rooms 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n6. We update the reward of each room based on the reward of the previous room plus the reward of the current room. The rewards for these rooms are: room 4: 0, room 7: 5, room 10: 0, room 13: 5, room 15: 0.\n7. We add the rooms to the priority queue based on their reward, which is now: room 7 (reward of 5), room 13 (reward of 5), room 10 (reward of 0), room 15 (reward of 0), and room 4 (reward of 0).\n8. We repeat the process with the room that has the highest reward in the queue, which is room 7. We visit the rooms connected to room 7: rooms 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15. However, we don't add room 1 to the queue since we already visited it.\n9. We update the reward of each room based on the reward of the previous room plus the reward of the current room. The rewards for these rooms are: room 4: 5, room 7: 5, room 10: 5, room 13: 5, room 15: 5.\n10. We add the rooms to the priority queue based on their reward, which is now: room 4 (reward of 5), room 7 (reward of 5), room 10 (reward of 5), room 13 (reward of 5), and room 15 (reward of 5).\n11. We repeat the process with the room that has the highest reward in the queue, which are rooms 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15. However, all these rooms have the same reward, so we can choose any of them. Let's choose room 7.\n12. The final path with the highest reward is: 1, 7, 13, 14. The total reward is 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 13, 14."
