Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room to room 1.\n3. For the current room, consider all its adjacent rooms (as defined in the problem statement) and calculate the distance from the initial room to each adjacent room via the current room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance for the adjacent room, update the tentative distance to this lower value.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. From the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms, stop.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (in this case, either room 8 or room 15) is visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine the shortest paths from room 1 to room 8 and room 15, and the corresponding rewards:\n\n- Shortest path to room 8: 1 -> 7 -> 8 (reward: 0)\n- Shortest path to room 15: 1 -> 4 -> 13 -> 10 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15 (reward: 10)\n\nSince the reward for room 15 is greater than the reward for room 8, the optimal path is the shortest path to room 15. Therefore, starting from room 1, the rooms to visit in order to collect the reward of 10 are: Answer: 1, 4, 13, 10, 7, 15."
