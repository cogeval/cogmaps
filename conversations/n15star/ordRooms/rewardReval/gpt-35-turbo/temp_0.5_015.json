Starting from room 1, we can visit room 8 and get a reward of 50 or visit room 15 and get a reward of 10. Here are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Create a table to store the distances and rewards for each room. Initialize the distance for room 1 as 0 and the distance for all other rooms as infinity. Initialize the reward for room 8 as 50 and the reward for room 15 as 10. \n\n| Room | Distance | Reward |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| 1    | 0        | 0      |\n| 2    | infinity | 0      |\n| 3    | infinity | 0      |\n| 4    | infinity | 0      |\n| 5    | infinity | 0      |\n| 6    | infinity | 0      |\n| 7    | infinity | 0      |\n| 8    | infinity | 50     |\n| 9    | infinity | 0      |\n| 10   | infinity | 0      |\n| 11   | infinity | 0      |\n| 12   | infinity | 0      |\n| 13   | infinity | 0      |\n| 14   | infinity | 0      |\n| 15   | infinity | 10     |\n\n2.
