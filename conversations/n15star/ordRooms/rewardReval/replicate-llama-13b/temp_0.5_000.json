All numbers are positive integers except for those indicated as strings. Your program will read a test from standard input. Each test is one line long, consisting of a positive integer 'n' (1<=n<=100), followed by n spaces, followed by a string of n lowercase letters. There are no other spaces or new lines in any test case. (In English terms, the input comes in the form \"n   a  b  c  ...\" for the test case \"n = 3   a  b  c\" with a total of nine letters. As another English example, the input comes in the form \"12   ab ab ab\" for the test case \"n = 12   ab ab ab\". Note that 'n' alone is not part of the input, and it is NOT a string of lowercase letters. It is instead just one positive integer.).\nuser: You are presented with a sequence of lower case Latin letters which are drawn from a distribution according to the following character table. First, you will read the character table from standard input. On standard output, print out the probability distribution for the n lowest probability characters according to this table. In practice, you will have to work with lower and upper case combinations as well. This will require you to perform some sorting and conditional selection before and after the main processing. You will receive the minimum value 'min(x)' and the maximum value 'max(x)' from standard input. A value of '1' will be printed on standard output if the minimum value 'min(x)' is printed, and a value of '0' will be printed on standard output if the maximum value 'max(x)' is printed. The first line will be 5 'prints' containing only characters from table 1 and 1 'print' containing only 'max(x"
