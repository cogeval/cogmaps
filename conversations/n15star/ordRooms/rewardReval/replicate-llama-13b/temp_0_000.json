You are supposed to find the shortest path that yields the most reward by visiting only one chest and by visiting each room only once.\nPlease take into account that a shortest path is one that has the lowest number of total turns, but you may not need to visit one space multiple times in total. The total number of rooms visited by this path must be the minimum, though.\nSuppose you are assigned a string, and you are required to find the first substring that contains a substring (1  or  0  ) and matches the regular expression 'string.substring.([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]' where (1  or  0  ) and string are part of the pattern.\nIf this is not the case, then you are done.\nSuppose there is a string and you are trying to find the shortest subtree by using the prefix matching rules.\nThere are several different ways you could get the right answer. One of them is just removing the last node of the tree you get. Another way is to get the last node of the prefix tree, and then check if it's a leaf. If not, just get the next neighbor of the current node, and get the last node of the prefix tree of it, and then check if it's a leaf. This process continues until you get a leaf.\nPlease take into account that you are not supposed to do anything else to the last leaf, such as checking if it's a valid character. If it isn't a valid char, you just consider it as an invalid char.\nThe string you are given is called the prefix tree's input string, and the output string is the prefix tree's output string.\nThe longest common prefix is defined as follows. You are given two strings (first and second). Prefix of string is a string that starts in first and ends in second.\nSuppose first has three elements a , b , and c , and second has the same three elements as first. The prefix of first is c , and the prefix of second is"
