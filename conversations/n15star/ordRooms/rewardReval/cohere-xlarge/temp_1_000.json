Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

You will open the file using the file() function, and then you will read the content of the file and print it.\n\nThe question is: What is the sum of the first 50 even integers? Hint: Use the sum() function and create a list of the first 50 even integers.\n\nWe are given the function that accepts an array of integers. The function will return the sum of all even numbers in the array.\n\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to use the Python dictionary, so you need to read the contents of the file and then use the dictionary to print the value of each line in the file.\n\nYou are given the file '"
