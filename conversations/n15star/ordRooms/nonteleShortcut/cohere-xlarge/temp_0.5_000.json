Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Your program should have the following elements:\n\nRecursion: the function should have one base case, which is to return 0 when given a single number. The base case should be stated in the problem and it is an assumption that the input data will always follow the base case. The recursive function will return the remainder of the problem if the number is not zero.\n\nExplanation: In the problem, the answer will be zero if the number is 0. In the recursive function, the base case is to return 0 if the number is 0. In the recursive function, if the number is not 0, it will return the remainder of the number divided by 10. If the remainder is 1, then the function will return 1. If the remainder is 2, then the function will return 2. If the remainder is 3, then the function will return 3, and so on.\n\nProblem: You have a 10\u00d710 board with 100 squares. Each square has a number between 1 and 100. You want to visit all squares on the board in the shortest way possible.\n\nIf you have any doubt about this solution please comment below,"
