Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Set the reward for room 8 as 50 and the reward for room 15 as 10. Set the reward for all other rooms as 0.\n2. Set the distance for room 1 as 0 and the distance for all other rooms as infinity.\n3. Create a priority queue and add room 1 to it with distance 0.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Pop the room with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   b. For each adjacent room, calculate the tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance and the reward of the adjacent room.\n   c. If the tentative distance is smaller than the adjacent room's current distance, update the adjacent room's distance and add it to the queue.\n5. Once all rooms have been visited, trace back the path from room 1 to room 8 or room 15 by checking the adjacent rooms with the highest reward and shortest distance.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1, 7, 10, 13, 15. The total reward collected is 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
