Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 8 with a reward of 50. The shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 with a reward of 10. The shortest path from room 1 to room 16 is: 1 -> 16 with a reward of 0. Since there are no rewards in room 16, we have to choose between room 8 and room 15.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 14 is: 1 -> 16 -> 14 with a reward of 0.\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we need to find the maximum reward between room 8 and room 15, and then compare it with the reward of the path to room 14. The shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is the same as before: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 8 with a reward of 50. The shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is the same as before: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 with a reward of 10. The reward for visiting room 14 is 0, so it is not considered.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 8, with a reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 8"
