Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

So, we discard this branch.\n\nFrom room 13, we can go to room 10, which we know already it's not the optimal choice. We can also go to room 4, which leads us to room 15. Room 15 has a chest with a reward of 10. \n\nFrom room 11, we can go to room 14, which leads us to room 8.
