Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to all other rooms and keep track of the maximum reward on each path. Then, we can choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 11 -> 8 with a reward of 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 50 (chest in room 8) = 50.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15 with a reward of 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 0 (no chest) + 10 (chest in room 15) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is the path to room 8. \n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,8."
