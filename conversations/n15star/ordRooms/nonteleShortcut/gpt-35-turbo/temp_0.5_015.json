Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Alternatively, we can follow the path 1-7-10-13-11-14-5-2, which gives us no reward.

Alternatively, we can follow the path 1-7-10-13-11-14-5-2, which gives us no reward. We can also follow the path 1-7-10-13-11-14-5-8, which gives us a reward of 50 from the chest in room 8. \n\nSince room 16 is connected to all of room 14's neighboring rooms, we can also follow the path 1-7-10-13-11-16, which takes us to room 16. From there, we can collect the reward from any of the neighboring rooms of room 14. The neighboring rooms of room 14 are room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 11. \n\nFollowing the path 1-7-10-13-11-16-14-8 gives us a reward of 50 from the chest in room 8. Following the path 1-7-10-13-11-16-14-5-8 also gives us a reward of 50 from the chest in room 8. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1-7-10-13-11-16-14-8 or 1-7-10-13-11-16-14-5-8. \n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,16,14,8 or 1,7,10,13,11,16,14,5,8"
