Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We assign each room a weight equal to the reward it holds and compute the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms. Then, we choose the room with the highest reward among the rooms that we can reach with the shortest path.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 10 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 15\n\nThe total reward collected in this path is 50 from room 8, which is the highest reward that can be obtained from the chests.
