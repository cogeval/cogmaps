First, we will create a graph with the given connections and weights (rewards). Then, we will update the graph to reflect the change in connections. Finally, we will run Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1 to find the shortest path with the highest total reward.\n\nThe graph with weights is as follows:\n\n```\n1: (7,5)\n2: (5,3)\n3: (6,7)\n4: (7,4)\n5: (2,6)\n6: (3,8)\n7: (1,2),(4,4),(10,1),(13,3)\n8: (2,4),(11,2),(14,6)\n9: (3,5),(12,3),(15,7)\n10: (1,3),(7,1),(13,2)\n11: (8,2),(14,4)\n12: (3,2),(9,3),(15,5)\n13: (7,3),(10,2),(15,6)\n14: (8,6),(11,4),(5,1)\n15: (4,7),(9,7),(12,5),(13,6)\n```\n\nTo update the graph with the new connection between room 11 and room 8, we will change the weight of the edge between room 11 and room 14 from 2 to 6, and the weight of the edge between room 8 and room 14 from 6 to 2.\n\nThe updated graph with weights is as follows:\n\n```\n1: (7,5)\n2: (5,3)\n3: (6,7)\n4: (7,4)\n5: (2,6)\n6: (3,8)\n7: (1,2),(4,4),(10,1),(13,3)\n8: (2,4),(11,2),(14,2)\n9: (3,5),(12,3),(15,7)\n10: (1,3),(7,1),(13,2)\n11: (8,6),(14,4)\n12: (3,2),(9,3),(15,5)\n13: (7,3),(10,2),(15,6)\n14: (8,2),(11,4),(5,1)\n15: (4,7),(9,7),(12,5),(13,6)\n```\n\nRunning Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1, we get the following path with the highest total reward:\n\n```\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15\n```\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,15"
