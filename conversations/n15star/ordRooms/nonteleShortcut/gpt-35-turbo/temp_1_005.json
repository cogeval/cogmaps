From room 7, we can access rooms 1, 4, 10, 11, 13, and 15. From room 10, we can access rooms 1, 4, 7, 11, 13, and 15. From room 13, we can access rooms 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15. \n\nSince room 11 is now connected to room 8, we can also access room 11 from room 8, and from there we can access rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14. \n\nTherefore, the possible paths from room 1 are:\n- 1, 7, 4, 10, 13, 15\n- 1, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14\n- 1, 7, 11, 8, 14\n- 1, 7, 11, 14\n- 1, 10, 4, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14\n- 1, 10, 4, 7, 11, 8, 14\n- 1, 10, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14\n- 1, 10, 7, 11, 8, 14\n- 1, 13, 4, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14\n- 1, 13, 4, 7, 11, 8, 14\n- 1, 13, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14\n- 1, 13, 7, 11, 8, 14\n\nOut of these possible paths, the longest one with the most number of rooms is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 4, 7, 11, 8, 2, 5, 14"
