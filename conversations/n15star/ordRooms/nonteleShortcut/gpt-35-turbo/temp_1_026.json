Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

First, we will create a graph representation of the castle with its rooms and their connections, then we will assign weights to the edges representing the rewards of the chests. After that, we will apply Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1, and find the shortest path to room 8 and the shortest path to room 15. Finally, we will compare the rewards of the two paths and choose the one with the highest reward.\n\nThe graph representation of the castle with its rooms and connections is:\n\n```\n1: 7, 10, 13, 11\n2: 5, 8, 11, 14\n3: 6, 9, 12, 8\n4: 7, 10, 13, 15\n5: 8, 11, 14\n6: 9, 12, 15\n7: 10, 13\n8: 14\n9: 12, 15\n10: 13\n11: 14\n12: 15\n13: \n14: \n15: \n```\n\nWe assign a weight of 50 to the edge between room 1 and room 8, and a weight of 10 to the edge between room 1 and room 15. All other edges have a weight of 1.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1 yields the following distances:\n\n```\n1: 0\n2: 1\n3: 1\n4: 1\n5: 2\n6: 2\n7: 1\n8: 50\n9: 3\n10: 2\n11: 2\n12: 3\n13: 2\n14: 3\n15: 10\n```\n\nThe shortest path to room 8 is 1-8 with a distance of 50, and the shortest path to room 15 is 1-4-15 with a distance of 2. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is the one that goes through room 8, with a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1,8."
