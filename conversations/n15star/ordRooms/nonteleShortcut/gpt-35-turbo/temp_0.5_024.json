The rewards for each room are not specified in the question, so we cannot determine the path with the highest reward. However, we can find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms after the connection between room 11 and room 8 is added. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 8 is: 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 3 -> 8 \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 after room 11 is connected to room 8 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 12, 9, 3, 8"
