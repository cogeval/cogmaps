Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The algorithm involves calculating the shortest distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. In our case, the graph is represented by the connections between rooms and the rewards associated with some of them.\n\n1. We start at room 1 with a total reward of 0.\n2. We initialize the distance to all other rooms as infinity except for room 8 and 15, which are initialized to their respective rewards (50 and 10).\n3. We mark room 1 as visited.\n4. We update the distances of the adjacent rooms to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13) by adding their rewards to the current reward of 0. We also update their predecessors to room 1. Room 8 and 15 are not adjacent to room 1, so we skip them in this step.\n5. We select the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 1, which is room 7 (distance of 0 + reward of 0). We mark it as visited.\n6. We update the distances and predecessors of the adjacent unvisited rooms to room 7 (rooms 4, 10, 11, and 13) by adding their rewards to the current reward of 0. We also update the distance and predecessor of room 8 as we have now found a path to it (distance of 0 + reward of 50). Room 15 is not adjacent to room 7, so we skip it.\n7. We repeat step 5 and 6, selecting room 4 as the next unvisited room with the shortest distance. We update the distances and predecessors of the adjacent unvisited rooms to room 4 (rooms 7, 10, 13) by adding their rewards to the current reward of 0. We also update the distance and predecessor of room 15 as we have now found a path to it (distance of 0 + reward of 10).\n8. We repeat step 5 and 6, selecting room 13 as the next unvisited room with the shortest distance. We update the distances and predecessors of the adjacent unvisited rooms to room 13 (rooms 7 and 10) by adding their rewards to the current reward of 0. We do not update the distance and predecessor of room 8 or 15 as there is no path from room 13 to them.\n9. We repeat step 5 and 6, selecting room 10 as the next unvisited room with the shortest distance. We update the distances and predecessors of the adjacent unvisited rooms to room 10 (rooms 7 and 13) by adding their rewards to the current reward of 0. We do not update the distance and predecessor of room 8 or 15 as there is no path from room 10 to them.\n10. We have now visited all reachable rooms, so we can trace back from the final node (room 15) to room 1 using the predecessors we have recorded. We get the following path: 1, 7, 4, 13, 15.\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1,7,4,13,15"
