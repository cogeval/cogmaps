We also initialize the reward to 0 for all rooms except room 8 and room 15, which we set to 50 and 10, respectively.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 3    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 4    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 5    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 6    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 7    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 8    | infinity             | 50             |\n| 9    | infinity             | 0              |\n| 10   | infinity             | 0              |\n| 11   | infinity             | 0              |\n| 12   | infinity             | 0              |\n| 13   | infinity             | 0              |\n| 14   | infinity             | 0              |\n| 15   | infinity             | 10             |\n\nNext, we start from room 1 and visit its neighboring rooms, updating the table with the shortest distance and maximum reward for each room. We then move to the room with the smallest distance and repeat the process until we reach room 8 or room 15.\n\n1. Room 7: distance = 1, reward = 0\n2. Room 10: distance = 1, reward = 0\n3.
