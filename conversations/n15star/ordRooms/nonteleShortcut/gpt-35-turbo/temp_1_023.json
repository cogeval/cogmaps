Starting from room 1, I will calculate the shortest path to all other rooms in the castle, taking into account the new connection between room 11 and room 8. Then, I will choose the path with the highest total reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest paths and their total reward from room 1 to each room are:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 13: 1\nRoom 11: 2\nRoom 8: 2\nRoom 14: 2\nRoom 4: 2\nRoom 15: 2\nRoom 5: 3\nRoom 2: 3\nRoom 6: 3\nRoom 9: 3\nRoom 12: 3\nRoom 3: 4\n\nThe highest total reward is 7, which can be achieved by visiting rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 8, and 14 in that order.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 8, 14"
