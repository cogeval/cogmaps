The correct solution to your problem is to start your path from room1 so that the path is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Then the total score is 50. If you start from room8, the path is 8,7,1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13 which leads to a score of 45.\n$\\begingroup$ Yes, please write out the rules/conditions you used to determine your solution. Otherwise, the answer to this kind of question could have gone on forever. $\\endgroup$ \u2013 David Schwartz Aug 23 '18 at 15:20\nThe first part of the code works out fine. The main problem was how to implement the second part of the code.\nI have implemented the second part by creating a list of room numbers and then reversing them.\nHowever, as @david mentioned, the solution to the question can also be derived directly from the problem statement, i.e., the shortest path that yields the most reward can be calculated by starting from room1 and then going to room2, then room3 etc."

The statement says starting from room1. It is not necessarily the case that all room numbers are connected initially. Also, starting from room 1 does not even give the correct answer as you are doing a sub-optimal solution. The solution should be shortest to room 8 and the path should start from room2 i.e. room 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13 (Answer: 12, 13, 8, 9, 5, 6, 2) $\\endgroup$ \u2013 Massaroa Mourthi Aug "
