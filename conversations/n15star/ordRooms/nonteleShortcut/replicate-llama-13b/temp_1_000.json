This path has a total reward of 6.\n\nSimilarly, starting at room 1 and following the chain (1-7-10-13) then branching out to rooms 15 and finally end at room 12 also has a total reward of six but not more than earlier mentioned above.\n\nAnother possible route is through (1-7-4) followed by branching out towards Room(10 or Room2). Then connect either one of them towards Room5\n\nNo other routes have rewards greater than six\n\nTherefore, the solution is: Answer: 1,7,10,13,11,14,8"
