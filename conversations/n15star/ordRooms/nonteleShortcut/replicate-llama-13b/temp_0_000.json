The rewards for each room are as follows:\n- Rooms connected to each other have a reward of +2\n- Rooms not directly connected but share a connection with another room in the path have a reward of +1\n- All other rooms have a reward of -1\n\nUsing these rules, we can calculate the total rewards for both paths:\n- Path A: Reward = (+2+2+2+(-1)) = +5\n- Path B: Reward = (+2+2+(-1)+(-1)) = +2\n\nTherefore, from room 1, taking Path A will yield more reward than taking Path B. However, since it was mentioned that now room11 is connected to room8 instead of its old connection with some other rooms; this means our previous calculation is no longer valid.\n\nSo let's recalculate based on new information:\n\nStarting from room one again there are three possible paths now:\nPath C :Room(01)->Room(07)->Room(04)->Room(13)->Room(15)\nPath D :Room(01)->Room(07)->Room(10)->Room(13)->room (08)-->room (11)(new)\nPath E :Rooms (01)-->(07)-->(10)-->(13)-->(14)-->(11)(new)\n\nFor each path, we can calculate its total reward by summing up the rewards of all rooms in that path. The rewards for each room are as follows:\n- Rooms connected to each other have a reward of +2\n- Rooms not directly connected but share a connection with another room in the path have a reward of +1\n- All other rooms have a reward of -1\n\nUsing these rules, we can calculate the total rewards for all three paths:\n\nPath C: Reward = (+2+2+(-1)+(-1))=+2\nPath D: Reward = (+2+2+(0)+(+1)+(-1))=+4\nPath E: Reward = (+2+2+(0)+(0)+(0)+(0))=+4\n\nTherefore, from room 01 taking Path D or Path E will yield more reward than taking Path C.
