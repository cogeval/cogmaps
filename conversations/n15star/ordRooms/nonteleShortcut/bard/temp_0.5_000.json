Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

To reach room 8 from room 1, you would follow the path:\n\n```\n1, 8\n```\nThis path has a length of 2 and a total reward of 50.\n\nThe reason why this path is shorter than the other paths is because the reward in room 10 is lower than the reward in room 8. Therefore, it is not worth it to travel to room 10 to collect the reward.\n\nThe reward in room 8 is 50, which is greater than the reward in room 15.

However, the reward in room 8 is greater than the reward in room 10. Therefore, it is worth it to travel to room 8 to collect the reward, even though it is a longer path.\n\nIn addition, the teleportation portal in room 13 allows you to reach room 10 without having to travel through the other rooms that are connected to room 13. This means that you can reach room 10 in a shorter amount of time.\n\nHowever, since room 14 is now connected to room 1, you can travel directly to room 8 without having to travel through room 14.
