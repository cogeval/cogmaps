Room 3 is connected to rooms 6, 9, 8, and 12.\n4. Room 4 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n5. Room 5 is connected to rooms 2, 8, 11, and 14.\n6. Room 6 is connected to rooms 3, 9, 12, and 15.\n7. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 10, and 13.\n8. Room 8 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 5, 11, and 14.\n9. Room 9 is connected to rooms 3, 6, 12, and 15.\n10. Room 10 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 7, 13, and 11.\n11. Room 11 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14.\n12.

Room 15 is connected to rooms 4, 6, 9, 12, and 14.\n\nNow, let's find the path from room 1 with the most reward:\n\n1. Starting at room 1, we can move to rooms 7, 10, 11, or 13.\n2. If we go to room 7, we can then move to rooms 4, 10, or 13.\n3. If we go to room 10, we can then move to rooms 4, 7, 13, or 11.\n4. If we go to room 11, we can then move to rooms 2, 5, 8, 10, or 14.\n5. If we go to room 13, we can then move to rooms 4, 7, 10, or 15.\n\nOut of all these options, moving from room 1 to room 13 provides the most direct connection to room 15, which is connected to the most rooms, maximizing potential rewards.\n\nAnswer: 1, 13, 15"
