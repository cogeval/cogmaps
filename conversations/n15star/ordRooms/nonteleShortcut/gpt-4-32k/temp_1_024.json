I will identify the groups of connected rooms and determine the best path accordingly.\n\n1. Analyze the connections between rooms.\n2. Identify groups of connected rooms.\n3. Determine the best path based on the groups and connections.\n\nThe groups of connected rooms are:\n1) Room 1, 7, 10, 13, 11\n2) Room 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\n3) Room 3, 6, 9, 12, 8\n4) Room 4, 7, 10, 13, 15\n5) Room 5, 8, 11, 14\n6) Room 6, 9, 12, 15\n7) Room 7, 10, 13\n8) Room 8, 14\n9) Room 9, 12, 15\n10) Room 10, 13\n11) Room 11, 14\n12) Room 12, 15\n\nStarting from Room 1, the best path would be to go through the connected rooms in group 1, then proceed to Room 8 from Room 11. From Room 8, the path can continue to Room 14.\n\nSo the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 8, 14.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 8, 14"
