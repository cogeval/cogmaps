Room 1 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11.\n2. From room 7, we can go to room 10 and room 13.\n3. From room 10, we can go to room 13.\n4. From room 13, we don't have any other new rooms to visit.\n5. From room 11, we can go to room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 14.\n6. From room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 14, we don't have any other new rooms to visit.\n\nNow, let's assume that each room has a reward of 1 unit:\n\n1. Path 1-7-10-13 has a reward of 4 units.\n2. Path 1-11-2 has a reward of 3 units.\n3. Path 1-11-5 has a reward of 3 units.\n4. Path 1-11-8 has a reward of 3 units.\n5. Path 1-11-14 has a reward of 3 units.\n\nSo the path that yields the most reward is: 1-7-10-13.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13"
