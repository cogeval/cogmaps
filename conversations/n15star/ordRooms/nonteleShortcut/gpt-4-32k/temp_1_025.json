Choose the room with the highest number, since the reward is assumed to be greater in higher-numbered rooms.\n4. Move to the chosen room and repeat the process until no more connected rooms are available.\n\nNow let's follow the logic:\n\n1. Starting at room 1.\n2. Rooms connected to room 1 are room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11.\n3. Room 13 has the highest number.\n4. Move to room 13.\n\n1. Now in room 13.\n2.

Now in room 10.\n2. Rooms connected to room 10 are room 1, room 7, room 13, and room 4.\n3. Room 7 has the highest number among the connected rooms that we haven't visited yet.\n4.

Room 4 has the highest number among the connected rooms that we haven't visited yet.\n4. Move to room 4.\n\n1. Now in room 4.\n2.
