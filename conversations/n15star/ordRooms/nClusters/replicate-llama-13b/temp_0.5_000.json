Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

In your case, you would use 1 X = 6 connections for the first solution. However, your final output would be the same.\nCan I think of it as \"if you have x and more connections, we would count it as 1 cluster\" ?
