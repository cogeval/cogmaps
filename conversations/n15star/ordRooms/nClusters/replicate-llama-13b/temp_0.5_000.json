We can represent each room as a node and draw edges between nodes that are connected to each other. Based on the given information, we can create a graph with 15 nodes and multiple edges connecting them.\n\nNext, we need to identify the densely-connected clusters in this graph. A cluster is considered densely-connected if it has a maximum of 2 rooms between any two rooms within the cluster. To do this, we can use an called Connected Components.\n\nUsing Connected Components algorithm on this graph gives us five clusters: {1,7,10,13}, {2,5,8,11}, {3,6,9}, {4} and {12,15}. However not all these clusters are considered as \"densely connected\" since some have more than two rooms separating certain pairs of rooms within them.\n\nSo after checking which ones satisfy our condition (max 2 rooms separating any pair), only three remain: {1 ,7 ,10 ,13 ,11 }, {2 ,5 ,8 ,14 } and finally{3 ,6 ,9 }. \n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
