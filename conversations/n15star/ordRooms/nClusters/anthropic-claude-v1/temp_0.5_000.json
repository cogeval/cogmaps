We need to find densely-connected clusters, which are groups of at least 2 rooms that are connected to each other.\n\n4. Let's look at the connections:\nRoom 1: Connected to 7, 10, 13, 11\nRoom 2: Connected to 5, 8, 11, 14\nRoom 3: Connected to 6, 9, 12, 8\nRoom 4: Connected to 7, 10, 13, 15\nRoom 5: Connected to 8, 11, 14\nRoom 6: Connected to 9, 12, 15\nRoom 7: Connected to 10, 13 \nRoom 8: Connected to 14\nRoom 9: Connected to 12, 15\nRoom 10: Connected to 13\nRoom 11: Connected to 14\nRoom 12: Connected to 15\n\n5. We can see 4 clusters: \nCluster 1: {1, 7, 10, 13, 11}\nCluster 2: {2, 5, 8, 11, 14} \nCluster 3: {3, 6, 9, 12, 8}\nCluster 4: {4, 7, 10, 13, 15}\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
