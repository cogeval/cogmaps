We need to find densely-connected clusters, which are groups of at least 2 rooms that are connected to each other.\n3. Room 1 is connected to 4 other rooms (7, 10, 11, 13). This does not form a cluster. \n4. Room 2 is connected to 4 other rooms (5, 8, 11, 14). This does not form a cluster.\n5. Room 3 is connected to 4 other rooms (6, 8, 9, 12).
