Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

This gives us: \nRoom 1: 7, 10, 13, 11\nRoom 2: 5, 8, 11, 14 \nRoom 3: 6, 9, 12, 8\nRoom 4: 7, 10, 13, 15\nRoom 5: 8, 11, 14\nRoom 6: 9, 12, 15\nRoom 7: 10, 13\nRoom 8: 14\nRoom 9: 12, 15\nRoom 10: 13 \nRoom 11: 14\nRoom 12: 15\n\n2. Identify groups of rooms that are connected to at least 2 other rooms in the group. The groups I see are: \nGroup 1: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11 \nGroup 2: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\nGroup 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 8 \nGroup 4: 4, 7, 10, 13, 15\nGroup 5: 9, 12, 15\n\n3. Count the number of groups. In this case, there are 5 groups of densely-connected rooms.\n\nAnswer: There are 5 clusters"
