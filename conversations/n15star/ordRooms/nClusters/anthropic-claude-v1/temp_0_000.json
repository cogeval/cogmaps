There are 5 groups: {1, 7, 10, 13, 11}, {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}, {3, 6, 9, 12, 8}, {4, 7, 10, 13, 15}, {5, 8, 11, 14} \n2. Check if any of these groups have more than 2 connections to rooms outside the group. Groups {2, 5, 8, 11, 14} and {5, 8, 11, 14} have 3 connections to outside rooms. So they do not qualify as densely-connected clusters.\n3. The remaining groups {1, 7, 10, 13, 11}, {3, 6, 9, 12, 8} and {4, 7, 10, 13, 15} are densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: There are 3 clusters"
