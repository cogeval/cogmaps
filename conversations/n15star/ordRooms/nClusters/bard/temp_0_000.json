We can do this by looking at the connections between the rooms.\n\n* Room 1 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11.\n* Room 2 is connected to rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14.\n* Room 3 is connected to rooms 6, 9, 12, and 8.\n* Room 4 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n* Room 5 is connected to rooms 8, 11, and 14.\n* Room 6 is connected to rooms 9, 12, and 15.\n* Room 7 is connected to rooms 10, 13, and 15.\n* Room 8 is connected to rooms 11 and 14.\n* Room 9 is connected to rooms 12 and 15.\n* Room 10 is connected to rooms 13 and 15.\n* Room 11 is connected to rooms 14 and 15.\n\nWe can see that there are 5 densely-connected room clusters in the castle:\n\n1. Room 1, 7, 10, 13, and 11.\n2. Room 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14.\n3. Room 3, 6, 9, 12, and 8.\n4. Room 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n5. Room 5, 8, 11, and 14.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 5\n```"
