Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle?

The rooms can be considered as vertices and the connections between them as edges. Using this approach, we can create a graph and identify its connected components. A connected component is a set of vertices that are all reachable from each other.\n\nAfter creating the graph, we find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this castle:\n1. Rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, and 11\n2. Rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14\n3. Rooms 3, 6, 9, and 12\n4. Room 15\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
