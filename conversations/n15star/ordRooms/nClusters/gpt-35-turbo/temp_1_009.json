Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

Each room is represented by a node, and the connections between the rooms are represented by edges. \n\nTo identify the densely-connected clusters, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. We start at a node and visit all nodes connected to it, marking each node as visited. We repeat the process for all unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited.\n\nDuring the DFS, we count the number of nodes in each cluster. If a cluster has two or more nodes, we consider it to be a densely-connected cluster.\n\nPerforming a DFS on the graph, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n- Rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, and 11\n- Rooms 2, 5, and 8\n- Rooms 3, 6, 9, and 12\n- Room 15 and room 4\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
