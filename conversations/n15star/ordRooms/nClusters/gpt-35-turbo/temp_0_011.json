We can represent each room as a node and the connections between the rooms as edges. Then, we can use a graph algorithm to find the clusters.\n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n```\n1 -- 7 -- 10 -- 13 -- 11\n|                    |\n4 -- 15             14 -- 2 -- 5 -- 8\n                     |         |\n                     11        14\n                     |         |\n                     6 -- 9 -- 12 -- 8\n```\n\nUsing a graph algorithm, we can find the densely-connected clusters in the graph. After analyzing the graph, we can see that there are 5 densely-connected clusters in the castle:\n\n- Room 1, Room 7, Room 10, Room 13, and Room 11\n- Room 2, Room 5, Room 8, and Room 14\n- Room 3, Room 6, Room 9, and Room 12\n- Room 4 and Room 15\n- Room 8\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
