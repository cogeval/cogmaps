Each room can be represented as a node and the connections between them can be represented as edges. Based on the given connections, we can create a graph with 15 nodes and multiple edges. \n\nThen, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find all the clusters of rooms that are densely connected. In DFS, we start from a node and visit all its neighbors recursively. We mark the visited nodes and continue the search until there are no more unvisited nodes. \n\nAfter applying the DFS algorithm, we can find that there are 5 densely-connected room clusters in this castle. \n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
