Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

We can represent the castle as a graph, where each room is a node and each connection is an edge. Then, we can use a depth-first search or a breadth-first search to find the connected components of the graph. \n\nStarting from room 1, we can do a depth-first search and mark each visited node as part of the same component. We can repeat this process for each unvisited node until we have found all the connected components. \n\nAfter performing the search, we can count the number of components that have at least two nodes. This will give us the number of densely-connected clusters in the castle.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
