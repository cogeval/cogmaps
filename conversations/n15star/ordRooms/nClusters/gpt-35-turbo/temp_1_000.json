Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

One such algorithm is the Depth-First Search (DFS). We can start from each room and perform a DFS to find all the rooms that are connected to it. If a group of rooms are connected to each other, we can count them as a densely-connected cluster. \n\nUsing this method, we can identify the following clusters:\n- Rooms {1,7,10,13,4}\n- Rooms {2,5,8,11,14}\n- Rooms {3,6,9,12,15}\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
