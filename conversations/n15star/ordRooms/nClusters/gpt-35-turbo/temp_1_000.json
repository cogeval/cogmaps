Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

Then, we can use a graph algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the clusters. \n\nStarting with room 1, we can do a DFS traversal to find all the connected rooms. This gives us the first cluster: rooms 1, 7, 10, 13, and 11. \n\nNext, starting with room 2, we can do another DFS traversal to find the next cluster: rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14. \n\nStarting with room 3, we can do another DFS traversal to find the third cluster: rooms 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. \n\nFinally, room 4 is not part of any of the existing clusters, so it forms its own cluster consisting of only itself.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 densely-connected room clusters. \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
