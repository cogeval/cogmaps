We can represent each room as a vertex and each connection between rooms as an edge. Then, we can use a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph and identify the connected components. \n\nAfter applying the depth-first search algorithm, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this castle: {1, 7, 10, 13}, {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}, {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}, and {4}. \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
