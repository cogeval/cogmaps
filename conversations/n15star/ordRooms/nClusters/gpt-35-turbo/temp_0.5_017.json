So, we have a densely-connected cluster of 5 rooms: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11.\n\nMoving on to room 2, we can see that it is connected to room 5, which is connected to room 8, which is connected to room 11, which is connected to room 14. So, we have another densely-connected cluster of 5 rooms: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.\n\nNext, room 3 is connected to room 6, which is connected to room 9, which is connected to room 12, which is connected to room 8. So, we have a densely-connected cluster of 5 rooms: 3, 6, 9, 12, 8.\n\nRoom 4 is connected to room 7, which is connected to room 10, which is connected to room 13, which is connected to room 15. So, we have a densely-connected cluster of 5 rooms: 4, 7, 10, 13, 15.\n\nFinally, room 9 is connected to room 12, which is connected to room 15. So, we have a densely-connected cluster of 3 rooms: 9, 12, 15.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 densely-connected room clusters in this castle. \n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
