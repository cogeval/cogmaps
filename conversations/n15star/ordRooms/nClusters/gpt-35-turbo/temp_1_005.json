Then, we can use the concept of connected components to find the densely-connected room clusters. \n\nAfter creating the graph, we can see that there are five connected components: {1,7,10,13,11}, {2,5,8,14}, {3,6,9,12}, {4,15}, and {16}. \n\nOut of these five components, only {1,7,10,13,11}, {2,5,8,14}, and {3,6,9,12} are densely-connected clusters since they are groups of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms. \n\nTherefore, Answer: there are 3 clusters."
