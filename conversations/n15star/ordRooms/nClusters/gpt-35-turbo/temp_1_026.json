First, we can represent each room as a node in a graph and each connection between rooms as an edge between the corresponding nodes. Then, we can traverse the graph and group rooms that are densely-connected into disjoint sets.\n\nStarting with the first set of rooms, we have {1,7,10,11,13}. We can see that room 1 is connected to room 7 which is connected to room 11 which is connected to room 13 which is connected to room 10 which is connected back to room 7. Therefore, this set is a densely-connected cluster.\n\nMoving on to the next set of rooms, we have {2,5,8,11,14}. We can see that room 2 is connected to room 5 which is connected to room 8 which is connected to room 14 which is connected back to room 11 which is already in the set. Therefore, this set is also a densely-connected cluster.\n\nFor the third set of rooms, we have {3,6,9,12,15}. We can see that room 3 is connected to room 6 which is connected to room 9 which is connected to room 12 which is connected to room 15 which is connected back to room 9. Therefore, this set is also a densely-connected cluster.\n\nFinally, we have a set of rooms that are only connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms, which are {4} and {8}. Therefore, these sets are also densely-connected clusters.\n\nIn total, we have 4 densely-connected clusters in this castle.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
