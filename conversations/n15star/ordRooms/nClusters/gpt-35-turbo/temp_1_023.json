How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To identify the densely-connected room clusters in the castle, we can use the concept of connected components. A connected component is a group of vertices that are connected to each other in a graph. We can treat the rooms as vertices and the connections between them as edges. \n\nUsing this approach, we can identify the densely-connected clusters in the following way: \n\n1. Initialize an empty list of clusters\n2. For each room, check if it belongs to an existing cluster. If not, create a new cluster and add all connected rooms to it.\n3. Continue until all rooms have been assigned to a cluster.\n4. Filter out clusters that have more than 2 rooms connected to each other.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the castle, we get the following clusters:\n\n- Cluster 1: Room 1, 7, 10, 11, 13\n- Cluster 2: Room 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\n- Cluster 3: Room 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\n- Cluster 4: Room 4, 7, 10, 13, 15\n\nClusters 1, 2, and 4 have more than 2 rooms connected to each other, so they are not considered to be densely-connected clusters. Cluster 3 has only 2 rooms connected to each other (rooms 9 and 12), so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\nAnswer: there are 1 densely-connected clusters."
