Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle?

Then, we can use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all the clusters of densely-connected rooms. Starting from a room, we explore all the rooms that are connected to it and mark them as visited. We continue this process for all unvisited rooms until we have explored all the rooms in a cluster. We repeat this process for all unvisited rooms until we have found all clusters.\n\nAfter applying DFS, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this castle: {1, 7, 10, 13, 4}, {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}, {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}, and {7, 10, 13}. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
