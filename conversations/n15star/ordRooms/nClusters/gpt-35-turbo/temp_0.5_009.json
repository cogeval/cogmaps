Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "First, let's create a graph to visualize the connections between the rooms. Each room is a node and the connections between them are edges. \n\nBased on the information given, we can create the following graph:\n\n```\n1 --- 7 --- 4 --- 13\n|         |     |\n11 --- 10    15\n|         |     |\n2 --- 5 --- 8 --- 14\n|         |     |\n6 --- 3 --- 9 --- 12\n```\n\nTo find the densely-connected clusters, we can use the concept of connected components. A connected component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other, but not to any nodes outside the group. \n\nWe can use depth-first search (DFS) to find the connected components in the graph. Starting from a node, we explore all its neighbors recursively, marking each visited node as part of the same component. Once we have explored all nodes reachable from the starting node, we move on to the next unvisited node and repeat the process. \n\nTo limit the size of the clusters to a maximum of 2 nodes, we can modify the DFS algorithm to stop exploring a component if it contains more than 2 nodes. \n\nUsing this approach, we can find the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n- Rooms 1, 7, and 11\n- Rooms 2, 5, and 8\n- Rooms 3, 6, and 9\n- Rooms 4, 10, and 13\n- Rooms 14\n- Rooms 12 and 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 6 clusters."
