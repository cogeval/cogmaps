Therefore, rooms 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14 form a densely-connected cluster. \n\nNext, we move to room 3, which is connected to room 6, which is connected to room 9, which is connected to room 12, which is connected to room 15. Therefore, rooms 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 form another densely-connected cluster. \n\nFinally, we have room 4, which is connected to room 7, which is connected to room 10, which is connected to room 13, which is connected to room 15. Therefore, rooms 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15 form a third densely-connected cluster. \n\nSo the total number of densely-connected clusters in the castle is 3.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
