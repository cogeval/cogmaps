This forms a densely-connected cluster. \n\nNext, we can move to Room 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14. Rooms 2 and 5 are not directly connected to each other, but they are both connected to Room 8. Rooms 8 and 11 are directly connected, and Rooms 11 and 14 are also directly connected. This forms a second densely-connected cluster. \n\nMoving on to Room 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Rooms 3 and 6 are not directly connected to each other, but they are both connected to Room 9. Rooms 9 and 12 are directly connected, and Rooms 12 and 15 are also directly connected. This forms a third densely-connected cluster. \n\nFinally, we have Rooms 4 and 15, which are directly connected to Rooms 13 and 10, respectively. This forms a fourth densely-connected cluster. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 4 clusters."
