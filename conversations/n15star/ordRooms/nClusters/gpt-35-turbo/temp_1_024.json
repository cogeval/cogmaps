Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

            "content": "First, let's draw the connections between the rooms. We can represent each room as a node, and the connections between rooms as edges. Using this representation, we get a graph with 15 nodes and 21 edges.\n\nTo identify the densely-connected room clusters, we need to find groups of nodes that are strongly connected to each other. One way to do this is to use the concept of strongly connected components. A strongly connected component is a group of nodes where every node is reachable from every other node.\n\nUsing a graph algorithm such as Tarjan's algorithm, we can find the strongly connected components of the graph. Applying this algorithm to our graph, we get the following strongly connected components:\n\n- Room 7, Room 10, Room 13\n- Room 8, Room 11, Room 14\n- Room 9, Room 12, Room 15\n\nWe can see that each of these strongly connected components contains at least 2 nodes. Therefore, each of these components is a densely-connected room cluster.\n\nAnswer: There are 3 clusters."
