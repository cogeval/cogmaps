We can then find the densely-connected clusters by looking for subgraphs where each vertex is connected to at most two other vertices.\n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n```\n1 -- 7 -- 4 -- 13 -- 10\n     |         |\n    11 -- 14 -- 5 -- 8\n     |         |\n     13 -- 15 -- 6 -- 9 -- 12\n```\n\nFrom this graph, we can see that there are 3 densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Room 1, room 7, and room 4\n2. Room 5, room 8, and room 14\n3. Room 9, room 12, and room 15\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
