This means that we have a densely-connected cluster with these four rooms. \n\nRoom 2 is connected to room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14. This means that we have a densely-connected cluster with these four rooms. \n\nRoom 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. This means that we have a densely-connected cluster with these four rooms. \n\nRoom 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. This means that we have a densely-connected cluster with these four rooms. \n\nRoom 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Since these three rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Since these three rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Since these two rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 8 is connected to room 14. Since this room is already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count it again. \n\nRoom 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Since these two rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 10 is connected to room 13. Since these two rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 11 is connected to room 14. Since these two rooms are already part of a densely-connected cluster, we do not count them again. \n\nRoom 12 is connected to room 15.
