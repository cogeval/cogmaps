Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a table with the distance from room 1 to each room, initialized to infinity, except for room 1 which is 0. Create a second table with the reward for each room, initialized to 0, except for rooms 8 and 15 which have rewards of 50 and 10, respectively.\n\n2. Mark room 1 as visited and set its distance to 0.\n\n3. For each of the rooms connected to room 1, update their distance and reward if the distance through room 1 is shorter than their current distance. For example, for room 7, the distance through room 1 is 1, which is shorter than its current distance of infinity, so we update its distance to 1 and its reward to 0.\n\n4. Among the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the shortest distance and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each of the rooms connected to the newly visited room, update their distance and reward if the distance through the newly visited room is shorter than their current distance.\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all rooms have been visited.\n\n7. Trace back the shortest path that yields the most reward. Starting from room 1, we can visit room 7, then room 10, and finally room 13 to collect the reward of 10 from the chest in room 15.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,15"
