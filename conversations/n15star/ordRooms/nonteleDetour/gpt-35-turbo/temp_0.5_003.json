We can use a graph to represent the connections between rooms and their rewards. Here is the graph:\n\n```\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 8: 2\nRoom 9: 0\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 0\nRoom 12: 0\nRoom 13: 1\nRoom 14: 2\nRoom 15: 1\n```\n\nStarting from room 1, we can calculate the reward for each possible path using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15: reward = 4\n2. 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2: reward = 10\n3. 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15: reward = 14\n4. 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2: reward = 8\n5. 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15: reward = 12\n6. 1 -> 15: reward = 1\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 14 -> 8 -> 14 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15 with a reward of 14.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 1, 7, 11, 14, 8, 14, 11, 5, 2, 6, 9, 12, 15"
