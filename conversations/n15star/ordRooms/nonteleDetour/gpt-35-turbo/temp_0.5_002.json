This path connects all the rooms that are connected to room 1, except for room 15 which is now connected to room 1. The total reward for this path is 7+5+6+8+4+3+2+1 = 36.\n\nAlternatively, we can follow the path: 1-15-12-9-6-3-8-14-11-5-2. This path connects all the rooms except for room 4 and room 7, which are not connected to room 1. The total reward for this path is 8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36.\n\nBoth paths have the same total reward. Therefore, either path can be taken to yield the most reward.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,14,8,5,2 or 1,15,12,9,6,3,8,14,11,5,2."
