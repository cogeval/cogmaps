Since the rewards are not specified, we will assume that each room has a reward of 1.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to each room is as follows:\n- Room 2: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8, 2\n- Room 3: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3\n- Room 4: 1, 7, 4\n- Room 5: 1, 7, 11, 14, 8, 5\n- Room 6: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6\n- Room 7: 1, 7\n- Room 8: 1, 7, 11, 14, 8\n- Room 9: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12, 9\n- Room 10: 1, 7, 10\n- Room 11: 1, 13, 11\n- Room 12: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12\n- Room 13: 1, 13\n- Room 14: 1, 7, 11, 14\n- Room 15: 1, 15\n\nSince room 1 and 15 are now connected, the shortest path to room 15 is the optimal path. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is:\n1, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 15"
