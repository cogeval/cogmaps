From there, it will explore all possible paths to other rooms, keeping track of the rewards for each path. \n\nBased on the given information, the algorithm will exclude room 11 from the paths, but will include room 15. \n\nAfter exploring all possible paths, the algorithm will return the path with the highest reward. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 4, 10, 2, 5, 8, 14, 11, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15"
