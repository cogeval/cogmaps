Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room. Initialize the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 1, which has a distance of 0. Also, create a table to keep track of the maximum reward that can be obtained from each room, initialized to 0 for all rooms except room 8 and room 15, which have rewards of 50 and 10, respectively.\n\n2. Mark room 1 as visited and set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the distance from room 1 to that room and update the table if the new distance is shorter than the previous distance. Also, update the maximum reward for that room if it is greater than the previous maximum reward.\n\n4. Among the unvisited rooms, select the one with the shortest distance from room 1 and mark it as visited. Set the current room to the newly selected room.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all rooms have been visited or the shortest path to room 15 has been found.\n\n6. If the shortest path to room 15 has been found, follow the path backwards from room 15 to room 1 by selecting the adjacent room with the shortest distance to room 1 and the highest reward. Continue until room 1 is reached.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15. The maximum reward that can be obtained is 50. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15."
