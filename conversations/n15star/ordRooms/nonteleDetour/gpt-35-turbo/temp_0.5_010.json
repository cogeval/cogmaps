From room 1, we can reach room 7, which is connected to four other rooms (10, 11, 13, and 15). From there, we can reach room 11, which is connected to four other rooms (2, 5, 8, and 14). From room 11, we can reach room 14, which is connected to three other rooms (2, 5, and 8). Finally, we can reach room 8, which is connected to two other rooms (5 and 14). Therefore, the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 7, 11, 14, 8.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 11, 14, 8"
