Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Of these rooms, room 11 has a chest with a reward of 50, so we should go there first. \n\nFrom room 11, we can go to room 2, room 5, room 8, or room 14. Room 8 has the chest with a reward of 50, so we should go there next. \n\nThe total distance traveled is 3 rooms (1, 11, 8), and the total reward collected is 50. \n\nTherefore, the order of the rooms we need to visit, starting from room 1, is 1, 11, 8. \n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8"

However, since we already know that the chest in room 13 has a reward of 0, going through these rooms will not be helpful.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is to go to room 13 and then to room 15 to collect the chest with a reward of 10. \n\nThe order of the rooms we need to visit, starting from room 1, is 1, 13, 15. \n\nAnswer: 1, 13, 15"
