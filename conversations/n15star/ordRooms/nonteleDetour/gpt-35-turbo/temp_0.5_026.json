Let's choose room 7. \n\nFrom room 7, the connected rooms are: \n\n- Room 1\n- Room 4\n- Room 7\n- Room 10\n- Room 13\n\nWe can see that room 11 is not connected to room 7, so we can't include that in our path. \n\nThe remaining rooms that are connected to room 7 are: \n\n- Room 2\n- Room 5\n- Room 8\n- Room 11\n- Room 14\n\nSince room 11 is not connected to room 7, we can't include that in our path either. \n\nThe remaining rooms that are connected to room 7 and room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 14. \n\nFrom these rooms, we can see that room 5 and room 14 are both connected to room 11, which is not connected to room 1. So we can't include those rooms in our path. \n\nThat leaves us with room 2 and room 8. \n\nFrom room 2, the connected rooms are: \n\n- Room 2\n- Room 5\n- Room 8\n- Room 11\n- Room 14\n\nWe can't include room 5 or room 11 in our path, so that leaves us with room 2, room 8, and room 14. \n\nFrom room 8, the connected rooms are: \n\n- Room 3\n- Room 6\n- Room 8\n- Room 9\n- Room 12\n- Room 15\n- Room 14\n\nWe can't include room 11 or room 5 in our path, so that leaves us with room 8, room 14, and room 15. \n\nFrom room 15, the connected rooms are: \n\n- Room 9\n- Room 12\n- Room 15\n\nWe've reached a dead end, so this is our final path: \n\n1, 7, 2, 8, 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 8, 15"
