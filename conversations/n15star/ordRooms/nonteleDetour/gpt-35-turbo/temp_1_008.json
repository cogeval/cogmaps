Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You are in room 1 and you have been told that there is no connection between room 1 and 11, but room 1 and 15 are now connected. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."
