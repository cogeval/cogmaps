Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We start at room 1 and mark its distance as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n2. We then visit all the rooms that are directly connected to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13). \n3. We update the distance of these rooms to 50 (since room 8 has a reward of 50) and mark room 1 as visited.\n4. We then choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 7) and repeat steps 2-3 for that room.\n5. We continue this process until we reach room 8 (which has the highest reward) or until we have visited all rooms.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 8"
