Then we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms, and choose the path that has the highest total reward.\n\nUsing the given information, we can construct the following graph:\n\n```\n    2 - 5 - 8 - 14\n   /      |    /\n  3 - 6 - 9 - 12 - 15\n /             |\n1 - 7 - 10 - 13\n        |\n       4\n```\n\nEach edge has a reward of 1, so we can use the shortest path as a proxy for the path with the highest total reward.\n\nWith the updated connections, the graph becomes:\n\n```\n    2 - 5 - 8 - 14\n   /      |    \n  3 - 6 - 9 - 12 - 15\n /          |   \n1 - 7 - 10 - 13 - 4\n        |\n       11\n```\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms:\n\n- Room 2: 1-7-10-13-4-7-2 (length 6)\n- Room 3: 1-7-10-13-9-3 (length 5)\n- Room 4: 1-7-10-13-4 (length 4)\n- Room 5: 1-7-2-5 (length 3)\n- Room 6: 1-7-10-13-9-6 (length 5)\n- Room 8: 1-7-2-8 (length 3)\n- Room 9: 1-7-10-13-9 (length 4)\n- Room 10: 1-7-10 (length 2)\n- Room 11: 1-7-10-13-11 (length 4)\n- Room 12: 1-7-10-13-9-12 (length 5)\n- Room 13: 1-7-10-13 (length 3)\n- Room 14: 1-7-2-14 (length 3)\n- Room 15: 1-15 (length 1)\n\nThe path with the highest total reward is to room 5, as it has the shortest path with length 3. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 1,7,2,5"
