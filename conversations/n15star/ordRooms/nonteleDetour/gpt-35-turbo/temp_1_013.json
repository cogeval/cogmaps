Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we assign a reward of 0 to all rooms except for room 8 and room 15, which have rewards of 50 and 10, respectively. Then, we start from room 1 and explore its connected rooms, which are room 7, room 10, room 11, and room 13. We update their rewards to be the reward of room 1 plus the reward of the chest in that room. Thus, the rewards of these rooms become:\n\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 0\nRoom 13: 10\n\nNext, we explore the connected rooms of room 7, which are room 1, room 4, room 10, room 11, and room 13. We skip room 1, since we have already explored it. We update the rewards of these rooms to be the reward of room 7 plus the reward of the chest in that room:\n\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 0\nRoom 13: 10\n\nThen, we explore the connected rooms of room 10, which are room 1, room 4, room 7, and room 13. We skip room 1, room 4, and room 7, since we have already explored them. We update the rewards of these rooms to be the reward of room 10 plus the reward of the chest in that room:\n\nRoom 13: 60\n\nNow, we have explored all possible paths from room 1 and we can see that the shortest path that yields the most reward is room 1 to room 10 to room 13. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,10,13"
