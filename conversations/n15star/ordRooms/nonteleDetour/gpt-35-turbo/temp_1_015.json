Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

First, we assign a reward of 0 to all the rooms except for room 8 and room 15 which have rewards of 50 and 10 respectively. Then, we start from room 1 and calculate the minimum distance to each room using the given connections between the rooms and the rewards associated with each room. We will also keep track of the maximum reward we can get from the path to each room. \n\nThe calculations are as follows: \n\n- From room 1, we can go to room 7, room 10, room 11, and room 13. The minimum distance to room 7 is 1, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 10 is 1, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 11 is 1, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 13 is 1, and the reward associated with it is 0. \n\n- From room 7, we can go to room 10 and room 13. The minimum distance to room 10 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 13 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. \n\n- From room 10, we can go to room 13. The minimum distance to room 13 is 3, and the reward associated with it is 0. \n\n- From room 11, we can go to room 14. The minimum distance to room 14 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. \n\n- From room 13, we can go to room 4, room 6, and room 12. The minimum distance to room 4 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 6 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 12 is 3, and the reward associated with it is 0. \n\n- From room 14, we can go to room 2, room 5, and room 8. The minimum distance to room 2 is 3, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 5 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 8 is 3, and the reward associated with it is 50. \n\n- From room 2, we can go to room 5 and room 8. The minimum distance to room 5 is 2, and the reward associated with it is 0. The minimum distance to room 8 is 4, and the reward associated with it is 50. \n\n- From room 5, we can go to room 8. The minimum distance to room 8 is 3, and the reward associated with it is 50. \n\n- From room 8, we have reached the chest with the highest reward of 50. Therefore, we do not need to continue calculating the distances to other rooms. \n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 11, 14, 8. \n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8"
