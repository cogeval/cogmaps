Then, I will choose the path with the highest total reward. \n\nThe rewards for each room are not provided in the task, so I will assume that all rooms have the same reward. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest paths from room 1 to each room are as follows:\n\nRoom 2: 1, 7, 4, 13, 10, 11, 2 (distance = 6)\nRoom 3: 1, 7, 4, 13, 10, 9, 3 (distance = 6)\nRoom 4: 1, 7, 4 (distance = 2)\nRoom 5: 1, 7, 10, 11, 5 (distance = 4)\nRoom 6: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 6 (distance = 6)\nRoom 7: 1, 7 (distance = 1)\nRoom 8: 1, 7, 10, 8 (distance = 3)\nRoom 9: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9 (distance = 6)\nRoom 10: 1, 7, 10 (distance = 2)\nRoom 11: 1, 7, 10, 11 (distance = 3)\nRoom 12: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12 (distance = 5)\nRoom 13: 1, 7, 10, 13 (distance = 3)\nRoom 14: 1, 7, 10, 11, 14 (distance = 4)\nRoom 15: 1, 15 (distance = 1)\n\nSince all rooms have the same reward, the path with the most reward is simply the one with the most rooms. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward is: \n\n1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9, 3 \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12, 9, 3"
