Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Thanks!\n\nThe task is to find a path from room 1 to room 15 that yields the most reward. As such, the final answer is: \"1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15\". The solution is to do a depth-first search on the graph. The code below has been written in Java, but can be translated to any other language of your choice.\n\nStep 1: initialize a 2D array of boolean values to denote whether a particular path is valid or not\n\nThe most important step here is the code to determine the final answer. The algorithm is to iterate over the 2D array of boolean values (validPaths) and sum the number of the rooms that lie on the path to determine the shortest path. The code to do this is given below.\n\n I have taken the liberty of defining a function getPathLength() that returns the length of a path. It's given below.\n\nThe important part of this code is the loop that iterates over the array of boolean values"

This is done by determining how many rooms on the path will yield a reward of 10 and how many will yield a reward of 50. The rooms that yield 10 are rooms 13, 14, and 15. The rooms that yield 50 are rooms 8 and 10. As such, the total amount of reward is: 10+50+50 = 120.\n\nI'm having trouble understanding the questions, too.
