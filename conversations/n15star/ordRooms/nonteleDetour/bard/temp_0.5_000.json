Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Identify all of the rooms that are connected to room 1.\n2. For each connected room, identify all of the rooms that are connected to it.\n3. Continue this process until you have identified all of the rooms in the castle.\n4.

Choose the room with the highest total reward.\n\nIn this case, the room with the highest total reward is room 8. To reach room 8 from room 1, you would follow the path:\n\n```\n1, 8\n```\nThis path has a length of 2 and a total reward of 50.\n\nThe reason why this path is shorter than the previous path is because the door from room 1 to room 11 is locked, so you cannot travel to room 11. The reward in room 8 is 50, which is greater than the reward in room 10. Therefore, it is worth it to travel to room 8 to collect the reward, even though it is a shorter path.\n\nThe teleportation portal in room 4 allows you to reach any room, but it does not change the fact that room 8 has the highest total reward. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward is still 1,8."
