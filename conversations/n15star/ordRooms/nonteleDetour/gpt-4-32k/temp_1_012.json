The rewards depend on the rooms visited.\n\nPath 1: Visits rooms 1, 7, 10, and 13. \nPath 2: Visits rooms 1 and 15.\nPath 3: Visits rooms 1, 7, and 10.\nPath 4: Visits rooms 1, 7, and 13.\n\nStep 4: Compare the rewards and choose the path with the most rewards.\n\nWithout knowing the actual rewards of each room, it's not possible to determine the path with the most rewards. However, based on the number of rooms visited, Path 1 visits the most rooms, which could potentially yield the most rewards. If each room has equal rewards, Path 1 would be the most rewarding.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13"
