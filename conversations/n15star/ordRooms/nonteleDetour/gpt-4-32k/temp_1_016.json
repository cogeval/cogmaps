Since we are only given connections between rooms, we do not have any information about rewards. However, we can calculate the shortest path with the maximum number of connections between room 1 and room 15, given the connections available.\n\n1. Start at room 1.\n2. Since room 1 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15, consider each possible path.\n3. The path 1-7-10-13-15 contains 4 connections.\n4. The path 1-10-13-15 contains 3 connections.\n5. The path 1-13-15 contains 2 connections.\n6. The path 1-15 contains 1 connection.\n\nBased on the steps above, the path that contains the most connections is the path 1-7-10-13-15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
