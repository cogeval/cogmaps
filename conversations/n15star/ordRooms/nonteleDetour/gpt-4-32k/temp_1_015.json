Room 1 -> Room 15\n\nSince there is no connection between room 1 and 11, we cannot include room 11 in any path.\n\nNow, let's assume that each room visited yields a reward. In this case, the path with the most reward will be the path with the most rooms visited. Therefore, the path with the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15"
