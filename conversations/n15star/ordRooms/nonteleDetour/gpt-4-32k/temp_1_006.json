In this case, the starting room is room 1, and the goal is to get the most reward.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the connections between rooms. Since room 1 and room 15 are now connected, there are three main options:\n       a. Room 1 to room 15 directly.\n       b. Room 1 to room 7 to room 10 to room 13 to room 15.\n       c. Room 1 to room 7 to room 10 to room 13 to room 11, then to room 14, and finally to room 15.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of rewards for each path:\n       a. The direct path from room 1 to room 15 has 2 rewards.\n       b. The path from room 1 to room 7 to room 10 to room 13 to room 15 has 5 rewards.\n       c. The path from room 1 to room 7 to room 10 to room 13 to room 11, then to room 14, and finally to room 15 has 7 rewards.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path that yields the most reward.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14, 15"
