In this case, the path that takes you to the most rooms is 1, 7, 10, 13, 15. This path takes you to 5 rooms, which is the most of any path.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how to find the path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Start in room 1.\n2. List all of the rooms that are connected to room 1.\n3. Choose the room that is connected to the most other rooms.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have reached a room that is not connected to any other rooms.\n\nIn this case, the room that is connected to the most other rooms is room 7. So, we will teleport to room 7.\n\nNow, we are in room 7. We can list all of the rooms that are connected to room 7. The rooms that are connected to room 7 are room 10, 13, and 15.\n\nThe room that is connected to the most other rooms is room 15. So, we will teleport to room 15.\n\nNow, we are in room 15. There are no other rooms that are connected to room 15. Therefore, we have reached the end of our path.\n\nThe path that we took is 1, 7, 10, 13, 15. This path takes us to 5 rooms, which is the most of any path. Therefore, this path yields the most reward."
