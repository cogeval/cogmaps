            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward, we will use a graph theory approach. First, we can create an undirected graph where each room is represented by a node and edges represent connections between rooms. Based on the given information, we can connect nodes for 1, 7, 10, 13, and 11; nodes for rooms 2,5 ,8 ,11 ,and14 ; nodes for rooms3 ,6 ,9 ,12 ,and8 ; nodes for rooms4 ,7 ,10 ,13,and15 ; nodes for rooms5,a nd14; and finally nodes for rooms6,9,,12,and15.\n\nAfter creating this graph or mapping out his castle-like structure with proper room representations described above - we recognize that it's not possible to visit all of these connected groups in one continuous path starting from Room-1. However if you move to middle of those connected group and them come back to continue your journey like visiting various smaller groups (Rooms) before mating back to original bigger group it seems more fruitful.\n\nSo let's categorize these connected clusters into three main groups consisting of Rooms `1 \u2192 {7\u219210\u219213\u219211}`, `2 \u2192 {5\u21928\u219211\u219214}` & `3 \u2192 {6 \u21929 \u219212\u29718}\u2972{4\u2971(7), 10\u27a1\ufe0f(13), [11|14]\u27a1\ufe0f[8|14], [13|15]`.\n\nThe optimal path which visits most number of different clusters is: \n\n`Answer: 1 \u2b51 {7 \u27a1\ufe0f [10 | True -> (path via cluster-3 : Start@Room=9->Cluster-3-> end@room=8)] \u27a1\ufe0f [13 | True -> (via Cluster-3 again)] \u27a1\ufe0f [11 | False]; }`; `10 \u2b51 [13 | False -> via Cluster-3] \u27a1\ufe0f 15` \n\nSo the complete path from Room 1 that yields the most reward is: \nAnswer: `1, 7, 9, 6,8 ,4 ,7 ,10 ,13 ,15.`"
