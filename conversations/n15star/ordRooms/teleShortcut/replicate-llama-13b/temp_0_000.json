Starting from room 1, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths and calculate their rewards.\n\nHere is the DFS algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack and add room 1 to it.\n2. While the stack is not empty:\n   - Pop a room from the top of the stack.\n   - If this room has not been visited before:\n     * Mark it as visited.\n     * Calculate its reward based on its number (room i has reward i).\n     * For each connected room that has not been visited yet:\n       + Add it to the stack.\n       + Update its reward by adding it to the current path's total reward.\n\nAfter performing DFS, we will have calculated all possible paths' rewards starting from room 1. We can then choose the path with maximum total reward.\n\nThe path that yields maximum total reward is: Answer: 1,7,10,13,15"
