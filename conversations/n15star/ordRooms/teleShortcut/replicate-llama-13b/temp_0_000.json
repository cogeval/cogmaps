With 10 and 6, you get 30 and 20, respectively. But 20 is more than 22, so we can't teleport to 6 with 20.

This means that from room 13 you can go to any room. Now, you've been told to find a path from the following rooms to room 13 that takes the least possible time based on distance. Also you can pick up and drop off things only once during a trip. There are three rooms: 3, 5, and 9 with the following distances: 12, 9, and 14 respectively. For example, the path C3-C5-C9-C13 takes the minimum time, but if you pick something up by the start (or end) of the trip, only one trip can be made during a journey, so you can't start and end at room 1 and 13 at the same time (i.e. C1-C3-C9-C13 is not an option).
