Here are the number of rooms that can be visited from each room:\n\n- Room 1: 5 rooms (7, 10, 11, 13, 15)\n- Room 2: 4 rooms (5, 8, 11, 14)\n- Room 3: 5 rooms (6, 8, 9, 12, 15)\n- Room 4: 5 rooms (7, 10, 13, 15)\n- Room 5: 4 rooms (8, 11, 14)\n- Room 6: 4 rooms (9, 12, 15)\n- Room 7: 3 rooms (10, 13, 4)\n- Room 8: 3 rooms (14, 2, 3)\n- Room 9: 3 rooms (12, 15, 3)\n- Room 10: 3 rooms (13, 7, 4)\n- Room 11: 4 rooms (14, 2, 5, 1)\n- Room 12: 3 rooms (15, 9, 3)\n- Room 13: 3 rooms (10, 7, 4)\n- Room 14: 3 rooms (8, 11, 2)\n- Room 15: 3 rooms (12, 9, 4)\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that room 1 has the most options with 5 rooms that can be visited. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward would be to visit all 5 of these rooms in the following order: 7, 10, 13, 15, 4.\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 15, 4."
