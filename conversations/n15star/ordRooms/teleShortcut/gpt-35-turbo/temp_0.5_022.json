Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we create a table with the reward values for each room:\n\n| Room | Reward |\n|------|--------|\n| 1    | 0      |\n| 2    | 0      |\n| 3    | 0      |\n| 4    | 0      |\n| 5    | 0      |\n| 6    | 0      |\n| 7    | 0      |\n| 8    | 50     |\n| 9    | 0      |\n| 10   | 0      |\n| 11   | 0      |\n| 12   | 0      |\n| 13   | 0      |\n| 14   | 0      |\n| 15   | 10     |\n\nThen, we start from room 1 and compute the shortest path to each room, updating the reward value for each room as we go. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Set the current room to room 1 and the current reward to 0.\n2. For each room connected to the current room, compute the reward for that room as the maximum of its current reward and the reward of the chest in that room.\n3. Choose the room with the highest reward among the connected rooms and move to that room.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until we reach room 8 or room 15.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 15\n\nThis path has a total reward of 10, which is the reward from the chest in room 15. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 15"
