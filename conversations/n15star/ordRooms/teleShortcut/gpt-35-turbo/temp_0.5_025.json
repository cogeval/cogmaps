We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms, and then we can check for each room if it is better to visit it directly from room 1 or to use the teleportation portal from room 16 to visit it from room 14.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 5 -> 11 -> 14 -> 16\n\nWe can see that room 8 is still the best room to visit first to collect the reward of 50. From there, we can either go to room 14 and then use the teleportation portal to visit room 15, or we can go to room 3 and then use the portal to visit room 6 and then room 15. The latter option is shorter, so the shortest path that yields the most reward is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 4 -> 15 -> 12 -> 9 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 5 -> 11 -> 14 -> 16 -> 15\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 4, 15, 16"
