From room 7, we can visit rooms 4, 10, 13, and 15. From room 10, we can visit room 13. From room 13, we can visit room 4 and 15. This completes one set of rooms that we can visit.\n\nNext, we can reach room 2, 5, 8, and 14 from room 1. From room 2, we can't visit any additional room. From room 5, we can visit rooms 8, 11, and 14. From room 8, we can visit room 14. From room 14, we can't visit any additional room. This completes another set of rooms that we can visit.\n\nFinally, we can reach room 3, 6, 9, and 12 from room 1. From room 3, we can visit rooms 6, 9, 12, and 8. From room 6, we can visit rooms 9, 12, and 15. From room 9, we can visit rooms 12 and 15. From room 12, we can visit room 15. This completes the third set of rooms that we can visit.\n\nTherefore, we can visit a total of 15 rooms: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 3, 6, 9, and 12. \n\nAs we can only use the portal once, we need to choose the best set of rooms to visit. In this case, we can choose the first set of rooms (1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15), which has the most number of rooms we can visit. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15"
