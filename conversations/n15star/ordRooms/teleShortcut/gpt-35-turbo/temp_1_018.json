First, we will assign a reward value of 0 to all rooms except room 8 and room 15, which have rewards of 50 and 10, respectively.\n\n1. From room 1, we can go to room 7, room 10, room 11, or room 13. We will update their reward values to 0 since there are no rewards in these rooms.\n2. From room 7, we can only go to room 10 or room 13. We will update their reward values to 0.\n3. From room 10, we can only go to room 13. We will update its reward value to 0.\n4. From room 13, we can only go to room 7. We will update its reward value to 0.\n5. From room 11, we can only go to room 14. We will update its reward value to 0.\n6. From room 14, we can only go to room 8. We will update its reward value to 50.\n7. From room 8, we cannot go to any other room. We will update its reward value to 50.\n8. From room 5, we can go to room 8 or room 14. We will update their reward values to 50 and 0, respectively.\n9. From room 2, we can go to room 5 or room 8. We will update their reward values to 50 and 0, respectively.\n10. From room 6, we can go to room 9 or room 12. We will update their reward values to 0.\n11. From room 9, we can only go to room 12. We will update its reward value to 0.\n12. From room 12, we can only go to room 15. We will update its reward value to 10.\n13. From room 15, we cannot go to any other room. We will update its reward value to 10.\n14. From room 4, we can go to room 7, room 10, room 13, or room 15. We will update their reward values to 0, 0, 0, and 10, respectively.\n15. From room 3, we can go to room 6, room 9, room 12, or room 15. We will update their reward values to 0, 0, 10, and 10, respectively.\n\nNow, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward. Starting from room 1, the possible paths are:\n\n1-7-10-13-7-1 with a total reward of 0\n1-10-13-7-1 with a total reward of 0\n1-11-14-8 with a total reward of 50\n1-5-8 with a total reward of 50\n1-2-5-8 with a total reward of 50\n1-4-15 with a total reward of 10\n1-3-12-15 with a total reward of 10\n1-6-15 with a total reward of 10\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1-5-8 with a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1,5,8"
