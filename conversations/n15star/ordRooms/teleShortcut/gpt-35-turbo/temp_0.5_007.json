Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nThe distances from room 1 to all the other rooms are:\n- Room 2: distance 2, no reward\n- Room 3: distance 2, no reward\n- Room 4: distance 2, no reward\n- Room 5: distance 3, no reward\n- Room 6: distance 3, no reward\n- Room 7: distance 1, no reward\n- Room 8: distance 3, reward 50\n- Room 9: distance 4, reward 10\n- Room 10: distance 1, no reward\n- Room 11: distance 2, no reward\n- Room 12: distance 4, reward 10\n- Room 13: distance 2, no reward\n- Room 14: distance 3, no reward\n- Room 15: distance 3, reward 10\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is to go to room 8, which has a reward of 50 and a distance of 3.

However, we can now use the teleportation portal in room 16 to teleport to any neighboring room of room 14, which can shorten the distance to room 8.\n\nThe neighboring rooms of room 14 are rooms 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 itself. We can teleport from room 16 to any of these rooms, and then continue the path to room 8. The shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is to go to room 16, teleport to room 5, and then go to room 8, which has a reward of 50 and a distance of 2. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 16, 5, 8."
