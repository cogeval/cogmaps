Starting from room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15. Among these, room 7 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (rooms 4 and 15), so we should teleport to room 7 next. From room 7, we can reach rooms 1, 4, 10, 11, 13, and 15. Among these, room 13 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (rooms 3, 6, and 12), so we should teleport to room 13 next. From room 13, we can reach rooms 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 6 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (rooms 2 and 9), so we should teleport to room 6 next. From room 6, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 2 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (rooms 5 and 8), so we should teleport to room 2 next. From room 2, we can reach rooms 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 5 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (room 14), so we should teleport to room 5 next. From room 5, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15. Among these, room 14 is the only unvisited room we can reach, so we should teleport to room 14 next. From room 14, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 15 is the only unvisited room we can reach, so we should teleport to room 15 next. From room 15, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Among these, room 12 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (rooms 6 and 9), so we should teleport to room 12 next. From room 12, we can reach rooms 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 15. Among these, room 9 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (room 8), so we should teleport to room 9 next. From room 9, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 8 is the only unvisited room we can reach, so we should teleport to room 8 next. From room 8, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 3 is the only unvisited room we can reach, so we should teleport to room 3 next. From room 3, we can reach rooms 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 4 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (room 7), so we should teleport to room 4 next. From room 4, we can reach rooms 1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 15. Among these, room 11 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (room 14), so we should teleport to room 11 next. From room 11, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 15. Among these, room 10 provides access to the most number of unvisited rooms (room 13), so we should teleport to room 10 next.

Among these, room 1 is the only unvisited room we can reach, so we should teleport to room 1 next. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 13, 6, 2, 5, 14, 15, 12, 9, 8, 3, 4, 11, 10, 1.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 13, 6, 2, 5, 14, 15, 12, 9, 8, 3, 4, 11, 10, 1."
