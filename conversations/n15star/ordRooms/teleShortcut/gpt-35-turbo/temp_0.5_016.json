When we visit room 16, we update the distances and rewards for all the neighboring rooms of room 14 instead of the neighboring rooms of room 16.\n\nWe start by creating the table and initializing it with the distances and rewards for each room:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 8    | \u221e                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 11   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 14   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nNext, we visit each room starting from room 1 and update the table with the shortest distance and maximum reward that can be obtained for each room. We start by visiting room 1 and updating the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 7, room 10, room 13, room 11, and room 16.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | 1                    | 0              |\n| 8    | \u221e                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | 1                    | 0              |\n| 11   | 1                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | 1                    | 0              |\n| 14   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nThen, we visit the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 1, which is room 7. We update the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 10 and room 13.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | 1                    | 0              |\n| 8    | 3                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 11   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 14   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nWe visit room 10 next, and update the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 7, room 13, and room 14.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | 1                    | 0              |\n| 8    | 3                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 11   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 14   | 3                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nWe visit room 13 next, and update the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 7, room 10, and room 14.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | 1                    | 0              |\n| 8    | 3                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 11   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 14   | 3                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nWe visit room 14 next, and update the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 11.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | 4                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 5    | 3                    | 0              |\n| 6    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 7    | 1                    | 0              |\n| 8    | 3                    | 50             |\n| 9    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 10   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 11   | 3                    | 0              |\n| 12   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 13   | 2                    | 0              |\n| 14   | 3                    | 0              |\n| 15   | \u221e                    | 10             |\n| 16   | \u221e                    | 0              |\n\nFinally, we visit room 5, which has the maximum reward of 0, and update the distances and rewards for its neighbors: room 2, room 8, room 11, and room 14.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Maximum Reward |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 1    | 0                    | 0              |\n| 2    | 4                    | 0              |\n| 3    | \u221e                    | 0              |\n| 4    |"
