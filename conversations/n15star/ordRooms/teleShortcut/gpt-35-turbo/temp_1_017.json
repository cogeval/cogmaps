We can choose either one of them, but let's choose room 11 to continue the path.\n\nRoom 11 has 4 connected rooms: 7, 8, 14, and 1.\nRoom 8 has 2 connected rooms: 5 and 11.\nRoom 5 has 3 connected rooms: 2, 8, and 14.\n\nFinally, we can choose either room 2 or room 14 to finish the path, as they are both connected to room 5.
