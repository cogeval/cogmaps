            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward, we need to find the longest path that can be taken from Room 1 without revisiting any room. We can do this by applying an algorithm to traverse the castle graph.\n\nOne possible solution is to use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from Room 1 to other rooms, and then choose the longest path as the one that yields the most reward. We can implement this algorithm as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the visited rooms.\n2. Create a dictionary to represent the graph, where each room is a key and its value is a list of adjacent rooms.\n3. Define a recursive function dfs(room, visited) that takes a current room and a list of visited rooms as input. This function will:\n   a. Add the current room to the visited list.\n   b. Iterate over the adjacent rooms of the current room.\n   c. If an adjacent room has not been visited yet, call the dfs function recursively with this room and the updated visited list.\n   d. Return the visited list.\n4. Call the dfs function with Room 1 and an empty visited list.\n5. Find the longest path from the visited list by checking the length of each sublist.\n6. Return the longest path as the answer.\n\nUsing this approach, the path that yields the most reward from Room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 4, 11, 14, 8, 2, 5, 6, 9, 12"
