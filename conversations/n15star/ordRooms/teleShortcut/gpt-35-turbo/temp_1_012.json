Finally, we visit room 14, which is the only room connected to room 11 that we have not yet visited. The shortest path from room 1 to room 14 has a distance of 3 and a reward of 0, while the shortest path to room 8 has a distance of 2 and a reward of 50, and the shortest path to room 15 has a distance of 3 and a reward of 10. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1 -> 7 -> 8. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8"
