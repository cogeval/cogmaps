Starting from room 1, the most connected rooms are room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11. However, since we can only teleport to each room once, we need to determine which of these rooms leads to the most connections that we haven't visited yet. \n\nFrom room 7, we can only visit room 10 and room 13, which we've already visited from room 1. From room 10, we can only visit room 13 and room 7, which we've already visited from room 1 and room 7. From room 13, we can only visit room 10 and room 7, which we've already visited from room 1 and room 7. From room 11, we can visit room 14, which is not connected to any other room that we haven't visited yet. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 11, 14.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14."
