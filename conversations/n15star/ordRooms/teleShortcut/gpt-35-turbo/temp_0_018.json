From room 1, we can visit rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15. Among these, room 11 has the highest number of connected rooms (4), so we should teleport to room 11. From room 11, we can visit rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14. Among these, room 8 has the highest number of connected rooms (2), so we should teleport to room 8. From room 8, we can visit room 14.
