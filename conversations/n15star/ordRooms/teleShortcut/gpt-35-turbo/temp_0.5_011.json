Then, we can choose the room that has the highest number of connected rooms. Here are the number of connected rooms for each room:\n\n- Room 1: 5\n- Room 2: 5\n- Room 3: 5\n- Room 4: 5\n- Room 5: 4\n- Room 6: 4\n- Room 7: 3\n- Room 8: 2\n- Room 9: 3\n- Room 10: 3\n- Room 11: 4\n- Room 12: 3\n- Room 13: 3\n- Room 14: 3\n- Room 15: 3\n\nBased on this, we can see that the room with the highest number of connected rooms is room 1. Therefore, the best path to take from room 1 is to visit all 5 connected rooms (room 1, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11) before teleporting to another room. So the path that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 11"
