Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14.

Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We need to apply Dijkstra's algorithm again to find the shortest path that yields the most reward. Starting from room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 16. From room 16, we can teleport to any neighboring room of room 14, which are rooms 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can create a new graph that includes room 16 and the teleportation portal. In this new graph, we have the following connections:\n\n- Room 1: 7, 10, 11, 13, 16\n- Room 2: 5, 8, 11, 14, 16\n- Room 3: 6, 8, 9, 12, 16\n- Room 4: 7, 10, 13, 15, 16\n- Room 5: 2, 8, 11, 14, 16\n- Room 6: 3, 9, 12, 15, 16\n- Room 7: 1, 4, 10, 13, 16\n- Room 8: 2, 3, 5, 11, 14, 16\n- Room 9: 3, 6, 12, 15, 16\n- Room 10: 1, 4, 7, 13, 16\n- Room 11: 2, 5, 8, 14, 16\n- Room 12: 3, 6, 9, 15, 16\n- Room 13: 1, 4, 7, 10, 16\n- Room 14: 2, 5, 8, 11, 16\n- Room 15: 4, 6, 9, 12, 16\n- Room 16: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n\nUsing this graph, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward. We can see that room 8 still has the highest reward, so we will prioritize reaching it. The shortest path to room 8 is through room 11 or room 14. Therefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 11, 8\n\nor\n\n1, 16, 14, 8\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 8 or 1, 16, 14, 8"
