Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, Visited, and Reward. Initialize the table with the following values: Room 1, Distance 0, Visited False, Reward 0. For all other rooms, set Distance to infinity, Visited to False, and Reward to 0.\n\n2. From Room 1, we can reach Rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13. Update their Distance values to 1, their Reward values to 0, and set their Visited values to False.\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the highest Reward value. In this case, it is Room 8 with a Reward value of 50. Update its Distance value to 2 and set its Visited value to True.\n\n4. From Room 8, we can reach Room 14. Update its Distance value to 3 and its Reward value to 0.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the highest Reward value. In this case, it is Room 15 with a Reward value of 10. Update its Distance value to 4 and set its Visited value to True.\n\n6. The algorithm is complete. The shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is: Room 1, Room 8, Room 15. \n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 15"
