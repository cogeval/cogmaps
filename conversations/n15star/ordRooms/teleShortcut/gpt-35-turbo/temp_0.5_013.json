Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Also, initialize a list of visited rooms as empty.\n\n2. Choose the room with the smallest distance from room 1 that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n3. Update the distances of all rooms connected to room 7. Room 10, room 13, and room 11 now have a distance of 1, and room 4 has a distance of 2.\n\n4. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we reach room 8 or room 15.\n\n6. Once we reach either room 8 or room 15, we can backtrack to room 1 by choosing the rooms with the smallest distance from the current room.\n\n7.
