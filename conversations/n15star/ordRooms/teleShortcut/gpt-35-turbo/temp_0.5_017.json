Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We initialize the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 1 (whose distance is 0), and the reward to 0 for all rooms. \n\nThen, we visit each room connected to room 1 and update their distance and reward in the table if it's shorter or higher, respectively, than their current values. We repeat this process for each room connected to the rooms we just visited, until we reach room 8 or room 15. \n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is to visit room 8 first, then room 15. The total reward collected is 50. \n\nTherefore, the order of the rooms starting from room 1 is: 1, 8, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 15"
