Here are the number of reachable rooms from each room:\n\n- Room 1: 5 (room 7, 10, 11, 13, 15)\n- Room 2: 5 (room 5, 8, 11, 14, 7)\n- Room 3: 5 (room 6, 9, 12, 8, 14)\n- Room 4: 5 (room 7, 10, 13, 15, 11)\n- Room 5: 4 (room 2, 8, 11, 14)\n- Room 6: 4 (room 3, 9, 12, 15)\n- Room 7: 4 (room 1, 4, 10, 13)\n- Room 8: 4 (room 2, 3, 5, 14)\n- Room 9: 3 (room 3, 6, 12)\n- Room 10: 3 (room 1, 4, 13)\n- Room 11: 4 (room 1, 2, 5, 14)\n- Room 12: 3 (room 3, 6, 9)\n- Room 13: 4 (room 1, 4, 7, 10)\n- Room 14: 4 (room 2, 5, 8, 11)\n- Room 15: 3 (room 4, 6, 12)\n\nAs we can see, rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 have the most number of reachable rooms with 5 rooms each. Since we can only teleport to each room once, we need to choose one of these rooms. Let's choose room 1 since we are already there. From room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15. We can then choose any of these rooms to teleport to next. Let's choose room 11 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (4). From room 11, we can reach rooms 1, 2, 5, and 14. Let's choose room 14 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (4). From room 14, we can reach rooms 2, 5, 8, and 11. Let's choose room 8 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (4). From room 8, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 5, and 14. Let's choose room 3 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (5). From room 3, we can reach rooms 6, 9, 12, 8, and 14. Let's choose room 6 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (4). From room 6, we can reach rooms 3, 9, 12, and 15. Let's choose room 15 since it has the most number of reachable rooms (3). \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 6, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 6, 15."
