Then, we can choose the room that gives us access to the most number of rooms that we haven't visited yet.\n\nFrom room 1, we can reach rooms 7, 10, 11, 13, and 15. Let's calculate the number of rooms we can reach from each of these rooms:\n\n- Room 7: 5 rooms (1, 4, 7, 10, 13)\n- Room 10: 4 rooms (1, 4, 7, 10, 13)\n- Room 11: 4 rooms (2, 5, 8, 11, 14)\n- Room 13: 4 rooms (1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15)\n- Room 15: 3 rooms (4, 13, 15)\n\nBased on this, we can see that room 7 gives us access to the most number of rooms that we haven't visited yet (4 rooms). Therefore, the path that yields the most reward is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 10, 13, 15"
