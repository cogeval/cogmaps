Room 3 is connected to room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8. Room 4 is connected to room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15. Room 5 is connected to room 8, room 11, and room 14. Room 6 is connected to room 9, room 12, and room 15. Room 7 is connected to room 10, and room 13. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 for visiting room 8 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 for visiting room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Set the starting node to room 1 and initialize its distance as 0 and its reward as 0.\n2. Initialize the distances and rewards of all other nodes as infinity and 0, respectively.\n3. Create a priority queue and insert the starting node with its distance and reward as the priority.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance and reward from the priority queue.\n   b. For each of its neighboring nodes, calculate the distance and reward if we visit that node and update the node's values if they are smaller than its current values.\n   c. If the neighboring node has not been visited yet, insert it into the priority queue with its distance and reward as the priority.\n5. When we reach room 8 or room 15, stop and output the path that led to the highest reward.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15.
