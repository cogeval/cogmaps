You have an inventory of widgets of different sizes, some bigger than others. The inventory is as follows:\nSize | Count | Percentage\nsmall | 4 | 4%\nmedium | 10 | 10%\nlarge | 2 | 2%\ngiant | 1 | 1%\nYou have a customer who wishes to buy a large quantity of widgets, but wants a mix of sizes, at least 50% of the mix being large widgets.\nProvide a solution that will sort the inventory of widgets in such a way that 50% of the sorted widgets are large and the remaining are a mix of small and medium widgets.\"\n\nHint: Use a hash map to store counts for each size of widget and use a sorting algorithm such as insertion sort or quick sort to determine the most optimal way to sort the widgets.\n\nNow that you have completed your first task, you can take the next step in your career and be hired by a human. When a human is considering you for a job, you want to give them as much information about yourself"
