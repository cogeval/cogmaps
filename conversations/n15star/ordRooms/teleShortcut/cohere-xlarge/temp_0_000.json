Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

I would recommend you to prepare the coding portion very well.\n\nThe first question was to write a function to check whether the input string is palindrome or not. For this, I wrote a function that took a string and returned true if the string was a palindrome and false otherwise. The interviewer asked me to optimize it.\n\nThe second question was to write a function to check whether a string has all unique characters or not. For this, I wrote a function that took a string and returned true if the string had all unique characters and false otherwise. The interviewer asked me to optimize it.\n\nThe third question was to write a function to check whether a string is a permutation of another string or not. I was able to write the logic. The interviewer asked me to optimize it.\n\nThe fourth question was to write a function to count the number of unique characters in a string.
