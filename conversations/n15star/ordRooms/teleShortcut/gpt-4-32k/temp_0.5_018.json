So, we can choose from groups 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12.\n\nStep 3: Determine the group with the highest sum of rewards.\n- Group 2: 2+5+8+11+14 = 40\n- Group 3: 3+6+9+12+8 = 38\n- Group 5: 5+8+11+14 = 38\n- Group 6: 6+9+12+15 = 42\n- Group 8: 8+14 = 22\n- Group 9: 9+12+15 = 36\n- Group 11: 11+14 = 25\n- Group 12: 12+15 = 27\n\nStep 4: Group 6 has the highest sum of rewards (42). Teleport to room 6.\n\nStep 5: From room 6, we can visit room 9, room 12, and room 15 in that order.\n\nFinal outcome: Answer: 1, 6, 9, 12, 15"
