From room 1, we can teleport to any room.\n2. If we teleport to room 7, 10, or 13, we can visit all connected rooms in the sequence 1-7-10-13-11.\n3. If we teleport to room 2, 5, 8, 11, or 14, we can visit all connected rooms in the sequence 2-5-8-11-14.\n4. If we teleport to room 3, 6, 9, or 12, we can visit all connected rooms in the sequence 3-6-9-12-8.\n5. If we teleport to room 4, we can only visit the connected rooms in the sequence 4-7-10-13-15.\n6. If we teleport to room 15, we can only visit the connected rooms in the sequence 15-12-9-6.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that the paths with the most rewards are the ones starting with room 7, 10, or 13, and the ones starting with room 2, 5, 8, 11, or 14. Both of these paths visit five connected rooms.\n\nAnswer: 1-7-10-13-11, 2-5-8-11-14"
