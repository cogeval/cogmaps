Room 3 is connected to: 6, 9, 12, 8\n4. Room 4 is connected to: 7, 10, 13, 15\n5. Room 5 is connected to: 2, 8, 11, 14\n6. Room 6 is connected to: 3, 9, 12, 15\n7. Room 7 is connected to: 1, 10, 13, 4\n8. Room 8 is connected to: 2, 5, 14, 3\n9. Room 9 is connected to: 3, 12, 15, 6\n10. Room 10 is connected to: 1, 13, 7, 4\n11.

Room 15 is connected to: 4, 6, 12, 9\n\nStarting from Room 1, the goal is to visit as many unique rooms as possible, since the portal can only be used once. By analyzing the connections, we can derive a path that maximizes the number of unique rooms visited:\n\n1. Start at Room 1.\n2. Move to Room 7.\n3. Move to Room 4.\n4. Move to Room 15.\n5. Move to Room 6.\n6. Move to Room 3.\n7. Move to Room 8.\n8. Move to Room 2.\n9. Move to Room 5.\n10. Move to Room 11.\n11. Move to Room 14.\n12. Move to Room 10.\n13. Move to Room 13.\n\nThis path visits all 15 rooms in the castle and uses the portal to move from Room 1 to Room 7.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 15, 6, 3, 8, 2, 5, 11, 14, 10, 13"
