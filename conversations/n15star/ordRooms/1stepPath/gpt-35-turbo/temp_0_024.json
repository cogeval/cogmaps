            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, and Visited. Initialize the table with the following values:\n   - Room 5: Distance 0, Visited False\n   - Room 2: Distance Infinity, Visited False\n   - All other rooms: Distance Infinity, Visited False\n\n2. Starting from Room 5, consider all the rooms that are directly connected to it (Rooms 8, 11, and 14). For each of these rooms, calculate the distance from Room 5 and update the table accordingly. The updated table should look like this:\n   - Room 5: Distance 0, Visited True\n   - Room 2: Distance Infinity, Visited False\n   - Room 8: Distance 1, Visited False\n   - Room 11: Distance 1, Visited False\n   - Room 14: Distance 1, Visited False\n   - All other rooms: Distance Infinity, Visited False\n\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is Room 8. Mark it as visited and consider all the rooms that are directly connected to it (Rooms 5, 11, and 14). For each of these rooms, calculate the distance from Room 5 through Room 8 and update the table accordingly. The updated table should look like this:\n   - Room 5: Distance 0, Visited True\n   - Room 2: Distance 2, Visited False\n   - Room 8: Distance 1, Visited True\n   - Room 11: Distance 2, Visited False\n   - Room 14: Distance 2, Visited False\n   - All other rooms: Distance Infinity, Visited False\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until Room 2 is visited. The next room to visit is Room 11, then Room 2. The shortest path from Room 5 to Room 2 is: 5, 8, 11, 2.\n\nAnswer: 5, 8, 11, 2"
