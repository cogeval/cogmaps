Starting from room 11, we can explore all the neighboring rooms that haven't been visited yet, then explore their neighbors, and so on until we reach room 1. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start from room 11 and mark it as visited.\n2. Add room 11 to a queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first room from the queue.\n   - Check if it's room 1. If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add all its unvisited neighboring rooms to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. If we reach here, it means there is no path from room 11 to room 1.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 11 to room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 11, 7, 1"
