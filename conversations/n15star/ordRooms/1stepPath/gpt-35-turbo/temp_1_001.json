Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n2. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 1.\n3. For the current room (room 1), calculate the distance to its neighboring rooms and update their distances if they are shorter than the current values. Also, mark them as visited.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until we reach room 10.\n5. Trace back the path from room 10 to room 1 using the previous room values stored during the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 10 is: 1, 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 10"
