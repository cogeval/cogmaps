            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with the distances from room 2 to all other rooms. Initialize the distance to room 2 as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 2 as visited and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14) to the sum of the distance to room 2 (which is 0) and the distance between room 2 and its neighbors.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 5) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 2, 8, 11, and 14) in the same way as step 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | 4        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | 5        |\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until room 8 is marked as visited. The final table is:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 3        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 4        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | 4        |\n| 13   | 5        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | 5        |\n\n5. The shortest path from room 2 to room 8 is the path with the smallest sum of distances. We can follow the path backwards from room 8 to room 2 by choosing the neighbor with the smallest distance at each step. The path is: 2, 5, 11, 14, 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 5, 11, 14, 8."
