Starting from room 2, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to the shortest path. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 2 which is set to 0. Set all rooms as unvisited.\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 2. Mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighbor of room 2, calculate the distance from room 2 to the neighbor. If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update the distance and set the previous room of the neighbor to room 2.\n4. Repeat step 3 for all unvisited neighbors of room 2.\n5. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 8. Mark it as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until room 5 is visited.\n7. To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 5, we can backtrack from room 5 to room 2 using the previous room information. The shortest path is: 2, 8, 5.\n\nAnswer: 2, 8, 5"
