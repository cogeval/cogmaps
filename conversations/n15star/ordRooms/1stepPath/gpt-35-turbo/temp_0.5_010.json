Initialize the distance to room 10 as 0 and the distance to all other rooms as infinity.\n2. Mark room 10 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 10, update its distance as the sum of the distance to room 10 and the distance between the two rooms.\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all rooms have been visited or the destination room (room 7) has been reached.\n6. If the destination room has been reached, backtrack from room 7 to room 10 using the table of distances to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 10 to room 7 as:\n10, 13, 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 10, 13, 7"
