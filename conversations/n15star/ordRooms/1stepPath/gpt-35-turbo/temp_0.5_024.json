            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 5 and to infinity for all the other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the starting room (room 5) to the neighboring room, through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 5 and its neighbor is room 8, the tentative distance to room 8 is 1 (since they are directly connected). If the current assigned value for room 8 is infinity, we assign it the tentative distance of 1. If the current assigned value for room 8 is already smaller than 1, we leave it as is.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. If there is no such room, the algorithm has finished.\n6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the destination room (room 2) has been visited. Then, we can backtrack from room 2 to room 5 to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 5 to room 2 is:\n\nRoom 5, Room 8, Room 2\n\nAnswer: 5, 8, 2"
