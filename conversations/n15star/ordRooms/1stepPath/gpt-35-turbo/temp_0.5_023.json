Starting from room 2, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to the shortest distance. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all rooms with distance infinity, except for room 2 with distance 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms and add all rooms to it.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Find the room with the shortest distance from the starting room (room 2).\n   b. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room.\n   c. If the calculated distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance for that neighboring room, update the distance and the previous room.\n   d. Remove the current room from the set of unvisited rooms.\n4. Once we have calculated the shortest distance to all rooms, we can trace back the path from room 14 to room 2 using the previous room information.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 14 is: 2, 11, 14.\n\nAnswer: 2, 11, 14."
