Initialize the starting node (room 2) with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with infinity distance.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. For each adjacent node to the starting node (room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14), calculate the distance from the starting node and update their distance values accordingly.\n4. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance (which is room 5) and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for all adjacent nodes to room 5, which are room 2, room 8, room 11, room 14, and room 7.\n6. Continue this process until room 11 is marked as visited. At each step, choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance.\n7. Once room 11 is visited, the shortest path is found. The path from room 2 to room 11 is: 2 -> 5 -> 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \"Answer: 2, 5, 11\"."
