For each of the current room's neighboring rooms, calculate the distance from room 8 to that neighbor. If the calculated distance is less than the neighbor's current tentative distance, update the neighbor's tentative distance.\n3. Mark the current room as visited.\n4. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 3) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 8 to room 3 as follows: 8, 2, 5, 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 8, 2, 5, 3."
