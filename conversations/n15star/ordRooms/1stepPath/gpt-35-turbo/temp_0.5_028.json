Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 8 and infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor.\n4. When we have finished considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new current room. If there is no such room, then we are done.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 8 to room 2: 8, 11, 2.\n\nAnswer: 8, 11, 2."
