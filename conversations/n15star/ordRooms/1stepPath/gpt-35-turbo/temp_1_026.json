We start at room 1 with a distance of 0 and mark all other rooms as unvisited with a distance of infinity. \n\n2. We then look at all the rooms connected to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, 13) and update their distance if the distance from room 1 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance. So for example, the distance from room 1 to room 7 is 1, so we update the distance of room 7 to 1.\n\n3. We then mark room 1 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 7).\n\n4. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 7) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 4, room 10, room 13). We update their distance if the distance from room 7 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance.\n\n5. We mark room 7 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 4).\n\n6. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 4) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 7, room 10, room 13, room 15). We update their distance if the distance from room 4 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance.\n\n7. We mark room 4 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 10).\n\n8. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 10) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 4, room 7, room 13). We update their distance if the distance from room 10 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance.\n\n9. We mark room 10 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 13).\n\n10. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 13) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 4, room 7, room 10). We update their distance if the distance from room 13 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance.\n\n11. We mark room 13 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 11).\n\n12. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 11) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 14). We update the distance of room 14 to be the distance from room 11 plus the distance between the two rooms (since it's less than the current distance).\n\n13. We mark room 11 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 14).\n\n14. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 14) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 5, room 8, room 11). We update the distance of room 5 to be the distance from room 14 plus the distance between the two rooms (since it's less than the current distance).\n\n15. We mark room 14 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 5).\n\n16. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 5) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 2, room 8, room 11, room 14). We update their distance if the distance from room 5 plus the distance between the two rooms is less than their current distance.\n\n17. We mark room 5 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 8).\n\n18. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 8) and the only unvisited room connected to it (room 14). We update the distance of room 14 to be the distance from room 8 plus the distance between the two rooms (since it's less than the current distance).\n\n19. We mark room 8 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 11).\n\n20. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 11) and the only unvisited room connected to it (room 14). We don't update any distances since the current distance to room 14 is already the shortest.\n\n21. We mark room 11 as visited and move to the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 7).\n\n22. We then repeat step 2 with the new room (room 7) and any unvisited rooms connected to it (room 4, room 10, room 13). We don't update any distances since the current distances are already the shortest.\n\n23. We mark room 7 as visited and since room 7 is our destination, we can stop.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is: 1, 7. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7"
