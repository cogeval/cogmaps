Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each room connected to the current room, calculate the distance from the current room to that room (which is 1 in this case).\n4. If the calculated distance is less than the tentative distance assigned to that room, update the tentative distance with the calculated distance.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the destination room (room 7) is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is: 1, 7\n\nAnswer: 1, 7"
