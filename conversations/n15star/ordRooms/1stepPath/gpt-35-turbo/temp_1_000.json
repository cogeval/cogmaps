Starting from room 1, we will keep track of the shortest distance to each room and update it as we visit more rooms. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distances to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which is set to 0. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room that is unvisited, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the weight of the edge between them. If this distance is less than the current distance to that room, update the distance. For example, the distance to room 7 is 1 because it is directly connected to room 1.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room with the shortest distance as the new current room and repeat from step 3.\n6. When the target room (room 7) is reached, the algorithm terminates. The shortest path can be found by backtracking from the target room to the start room using the distance and predecessor information stored during the algorithm.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is:\n\n1, 7\n\nAnswer: 1, 7"
