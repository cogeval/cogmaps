Assign a tentative distance value of zero to room 5 and infinity to all other rooms. Set room 5 as the current room.\n2. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors (rooms 8, 11, and 14). Calculate their tentative distance values (which will be the current room's distance plus the distance to the neighbor). \n3. If any neighbor has a lower tentative distance value than its current distance value, update the neighbor's distance value and set its parent as the current room.\n4. When all neighbors have been considered, mark the current room as \"visited\" and choose the unvisited room with the lowest tentative distance value as the next current room. \n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 2) has been marked as visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 5 to room 2 is: 5, 11, 2.\n\nAnswer: 5, 11, 2."
