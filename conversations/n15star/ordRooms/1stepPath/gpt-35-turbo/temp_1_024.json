Create a graph with 15 vertices representing each room, and edges connecting the rooms that are connected to each other.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge.\n3. Start at room 1, and set the distance to itself as 0, and the distance to all other rooms as infinity.\n4. Set the unvisited set to contain all the rooms.\n5. While the unvisited set is not empty, select the room with the smallest distance, and visit all its neighbors. For each neighbor, calculate the tentative distance by adding the weight of the edge from the current room, and compare it to the current distance. If it's smaller, update the distance.\n6. When all neighbors are visited, mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n7. Repeat step 5 until room 7 is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is: 1, 7. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7."
