The next neighboring rooms are room 2 and room 15, with distances of 3.\n4. The next neighboring room is room 13, with a distance of 4.\n5. The next neighboring rooms are room 5, room 8, and room 14, with distances of 5.\n6. The next neighboring room is room 10, with a distance of 6.\n7. The next neighboring rooms are room 3 and room 12, with distances of 7.\n8.
