Starting from room 2, we can explore all possible paths to reach room 11 and choose the shortest one. Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start from room 2 and add it to the queue.\n2. Mark room 2 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the first room from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued room is room 11, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the path.\n   c. Otherwise, add all unvisited adjacent rooms of the dequeued room to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found room 11, there is no path from room 2 to room 11.\n\nUsing the above algorithm, the shortest path from room 2 to room 11 is: 2, 11\n\nAnswer: 2, 11"
