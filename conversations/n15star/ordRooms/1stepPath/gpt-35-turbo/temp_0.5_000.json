Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to it. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance of each room from room 1 as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0. Also, create an empty set of visited rooms and a priority queue of rooms to visit, starting with room 1.\n2. While the priority queue is not empty, take the room with the smallest distance from the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room that has not been visited, calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to that room through the current room. If this distance is smaller than the previous distance (or if the room has not been visited yet), update the distance and the previous room.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the destination room (room 7) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is: 1, 7\n\nAnswer: 1, 7"
