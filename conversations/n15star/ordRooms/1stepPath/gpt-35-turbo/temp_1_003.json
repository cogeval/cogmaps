We choose the room with the smallest distance, which is room 7. So we move to room 7.\n4. The neighboring rooms of room 7 are room 4, room 1, room 10, room 13, and room 11. The distances to these rooms are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 2, respectively.\n5. We choose the room with the smallest distance, which is room 11. So we move to room 11.\n6.
