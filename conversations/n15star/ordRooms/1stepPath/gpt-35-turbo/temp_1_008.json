Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for the starting room (room 10) and to infinity for all other rooms.\n\n2. Set the starting room (room 10) as current and create a set of visited rooms, initially empty.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances from the starting room (room 10). The tentative distance is the distance from the starting room to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor.\n\n4. If the tentative distance for a neighbor is less than its current distance, update its distance to the tentative distance.\n\n5. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n6. If the destination room (room 1) has been visited, stop. The shortest path has been found.\n\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current room, and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 10 to room 1 is: 10, 13, 7, 1.\n\nAnswer: 10, 13, 7, 1."
