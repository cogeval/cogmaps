Starting from room 13, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room visited to reconstruct the path. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 13 which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms and add all rooms to it.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty:\n   a. Find the room with the shortest distance from the starting room (room 13) and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n   b. For each neighboring room that is still in the set of unvisited rooms, calculate the distance from the starting room through the current room. If this distance is shorter than the previously calculated distance, update the distance and the previous room.\n4. Reconstruct the shortest path from room 13 to room 10 using the previous room information.\n\nThe shortest path from room 13 to room 10 is: 13, 7, 10.\n\nAnswer: 13, 7, 10"
