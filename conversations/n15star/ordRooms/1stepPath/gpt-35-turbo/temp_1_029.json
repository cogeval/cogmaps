Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room. Initially, the distance to room 1 is 0, and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n2. Create a set to keep track of unvisited rooms. Add all rooms to the set.\n3. While the set is not empty:\n   a. Find the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 1. Let's call this room \"current\".\n   b. For each neighboring room of \"current\", calculate the distance from room 1 to that neighboring room through \"current\". If this distance is shorter than the current shortest distance to that neighboring room, update the shortest distance.\n   c. If the destination room (room 7) has been visited, we can stop the algorithm.\n4. Trace back the shortest path from room 7 to room 1.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is: 1, 7\n\nAnswer: 1, 7"
