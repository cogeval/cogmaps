The distance from room 1 to them is both one. We add these two rooms to a priority queue with their distance set as their key value.\n\nNext, we retrieve the node with the smallest key value from the queue which is room 7. Since this node is already visited and has been explored before by visiting either of its neighbors (room 1 or room 10), there's no need to revisit it again.\n\nWe then explore the neighboring nodes of the unvisited rooms in ascending order of distances. So next on our list are rooms {2,13}. Room {13} will be explored since it has a shorter distance (2) compared to that of {2} (3). Next up after exploring Room {13}, Rooms connected are:\n{11}(distance=3)<-{14}(distance=4);\nRooms connected: \n{9}(distance=4),\n{10}\\_{12}\\_{15} (cluster being surrounded by edges coming into node).\nWe check each edge starting with connecting edge around cluster Room {12}-Room{15},\nshortest distance is between directly connected pair:\n(i.e.) Room `{15}` -> Room `{12}`\nAdditionally other pairs provide greater than given direct connection i.e `8>6`.\nSo now all available paths have same number of steps/same length.\nTherefore Shortest path between every adjacent pair visisted is :\n\n`[Room_1(Room Number =01)] ->(Length=+01) [Room_07] ->\n   [I](Length+=02)->[Room_10]{Representing new Cluster/component}\n   [II](length+=03)->[Room_13]->\n      [IIIa-Recommended](Length+=01)->[Room_11]->\n     [IIIb](Length+02) - Room 14(matching minimum length also)->\n      (following continuing paths are greater than the ones done/visited till this point.)\n    [IV](length =4) -> [Room9] from either (`13` or `11`)\n   `[V]`= {[idx][Vertex]}= {04}{7} => With stops along cluster, minimum total\n\nTherefore the shortest path from room 1 to room 7 is:\n\nAnswer: 1,7"
