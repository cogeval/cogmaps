Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room as room 1.\n3. For each adjacent room of the current room, calculate its tentative distance (which is the sum of its own weight plus the weight of the current room). If this tentative distance is less than its current distance value, update it with this new value.\n4. Mark the current node as visited and remove it from unvisited nodes list.\n5. Find out which unvisited node has minimum tentatively calculated distance and set that as next \"current\" node.\n6. Repeat step #3 - #5 until either destination node or no reachable nodes left in unvisited set.\n\nThe shortest path from Room 1 to Room 2 is: \n\nAnswer: 1,7,10,13,11,14,2"
