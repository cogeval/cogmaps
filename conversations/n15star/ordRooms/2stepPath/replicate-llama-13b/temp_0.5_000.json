Assign a tentative distance of zero to the starting vertex (room 1) and infinity to all other vertices.\n\n2. Set the starting vertex as current and mark it visited.\n\n3. For each neighbor of the current vertex, calculate its tentative distance by adding the weight of the edge between it and the current vertex to the current vertex's tentative distance. If this calculated distance is less than its assigned tentative distance, update it.\n\n4. When we have finished considering all neighbors of the current vertex, mark it as visited.\n\n5. Select an unvisited vertex with minimum tentative distance and set it as new \"current\" then go back to step 3 until you reach your destination (room 2).\n\nApplying these steps yields that shortest path from room 1 to room 2 is: \n\nAnswer: 1,10,13,7,4,15,13,11,14,2"
