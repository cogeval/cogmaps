Room 3 connects to rooms: 6, 9, 12, and 8.\n4. Room 4 connects to rooms: 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n5. Room 5 connects to rooms: 2, 8, 11, and 14.\n6. Room 6 connects to rooms: 3, 9, 12, and 15.\n7. Room 7 connects to rooms: 1, 4, 10, and 13.\n8. Room 8 connects to rooms: 2, 3, 5, 11, and 14.\n9. Room 9 connects to rooms: 3, 6, 12, and 15.\n10. Room 10 connects to rooms: 1, 4, 7, and 13.\n11. Room 11 connects to rooms: 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n12. Room 12 connects to rooms: 3, 6, 9, and 15.\n13. Room 13 connects to rooms: 1, 4, 7, and 10.\n14. Room 14 connects to rooms: 2, 5, 8, 11, and 15.\n15. Room 15 connects to rooms: 4, 6, 9, 12, and 14.\n\nNow let's find the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 2:\n\n1. From Room 1, we can go to rooms: 7, 10, 11, or 13.\n2. If we go to Room 7, the connected rooms (4, 10, 13) don't lead to Room 2. So, this path won't work.\n3. If we go to Room 10, the connected rooms (4, 7, 13) don't lead to Room 2. So, this path won't work either.\n4. If we go to Room 11, we can directly reach Room 2.\n5. If we go to Room 13, the connected rooms (1, 4, 7, 10) don't lead to Room 2. So, this path won't work.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 2 is through Room 11.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 2"
