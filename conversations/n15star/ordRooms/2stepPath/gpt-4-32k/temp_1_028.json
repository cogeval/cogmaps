None of them are directly connected to room 8.\nStep 4: Since room 8 is not directly connected to any of the rooms connected to room 6, we will need to look at the rooms connected to each of these rooms:\n- Room 9 is connected to room 12 and room 15.\n- Room 12 is connected to room 15.\n- Room 15 is not directly connected to any rooms mentioned earlier.\nStep 5: Check if room 8 is connected to any of the rooms connected to rooms 9, 12, or 15. Room 8 is connected to room 14, and room 14 is connected to room 12.\nStep 6: To reach room 8, we will start from room 6, then go to room 12, then room 14, and finally, room 8.\n\nAnswer: 6, 12, 14, 8"
