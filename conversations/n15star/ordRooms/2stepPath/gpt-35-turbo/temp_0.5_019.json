The distance to room 8 is 0, and all other distances are infinity.\n\n2. The neighbors of room 8 are room 5, room 11, room 14. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 5: 1 (via room 8)\n   - Distance to room 11: 1 (via room 8)\n   - Distance to room 14: 1 (via room 8)\n\n3. The next room to visit is room 5, since it has the shortest distance. The neighbors of room 5 are room 2, room 8, and room 11. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 2: 2 (via room 5)\n   - Distance to room 8: 1 (via room 5)\n   - Distance to room 11: 1 (via room 5)\n\n4. The next room to visit is room 11, since it has the shortest distance. The neighbors of room 11 are room 1, room 2, room 5, and room 14. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 1: 3 (via room 11 and room 7)\n   - Distance to room 2: 2 (via room 5)\n   - Distance to room 5: 1 (via room 11)\n   - Distance to room 14: 2 (via room 11 and room 14)\n\n5. The next room to visit is room 5, since it has the shortest distance. However, we have already visited room 5, so we skip it.\n\n6. The next room to visit is room 8, since it has the shortest distance. However, we have already visited room 8, so we skip it.\n\n7. The next room to visit is room 14, since it has the shortest distance. The neighbors of room 14 are room 2, room 11, and room 15. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 2: 3 (via room 14, room 11, and room 5)\n   - Distance to room 11: 2 (via room 14 and room 11)\n   - Distance to room 15: 3 (via room 14 and room 13)\n\n8. The next room to visit is room 11, since it has the shortest distance. However, we have already visited room 11, so we skip it.\n\n9. The next room to visit is room 2, since it has the shortest distance. The neighbors of room 2 are room 5 and room 14. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 5: 3 (via room 2 and room 11)\n   - Distance to room 14: 3 (via room 2 and room 14)\n\n10. The next room to visit is room 5, since it has the shortest distance. However, we have already visited room 5, so we skip it.\n\n11. The next room to visit is room 14, since it has the shortest distance. However, we have already visited room 14, so we skip it.\n\n12. The next room to visit is room 15, since it has the shortest distance. The neighbors of room 15 are room 4 and room 6. Update their distances as follows:\n   - Distance to room 4: 4 (via room 15, room 13, and room 10)\n   - Distance to room 6: 2 (via room 15 and room 6)\n\n13. The next room to visit is room 6, since it has the shortest distance. We have found the shortest path from room 8 to room 6, which is:\n   Answer: 8, 11, 14, 2, 5, 11, 14, 15, 6"
