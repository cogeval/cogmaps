Initialize a set to keep track of visited rooms and add room 8 to the set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first room in the queue and check if it's room 6. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop. Otherwise, continue to step 4.\n4. For each of the connected rooms of the dequeued room, if the room has not been visited yet, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and record its parent (the dequeued room).\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until either we find room 6 or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is:\n\nAnswer: 8, 14, 11, 6"
