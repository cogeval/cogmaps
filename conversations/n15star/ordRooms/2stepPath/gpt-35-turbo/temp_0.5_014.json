Create a table with the distance from room 2 to each room, initialized to infinity except for room 2, which is 0. Also create a table to keep track of the visited rooms, initialized to false for all rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | infinity | false   |\n| 2    | 0        | false   |\n| 3    | infinity | false   |\n| 4    | infinity | false   |\n| 5    | infinity | false   |\n| 6    | infinity | false   |\n| 7    | infinity | false   |\n| 8    | infinity | false   |\n| 9    | infinity | false   |\n| 10   | infinity | false   |\n| 11   | infinity | false   |\n| 12   | infinity | false   |\n| 13   | infinity | false   |\n| 14   | infinity | false   |\n| 15   | infinity | false   |\n\n2. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 2. Mark it as visited.\n\n3. For each of the unvisited rooms that are connected to room 2 (rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14), calculate the distance from room 2 to that room (which is 1 for all of them, since they are directly connected). If the calculated distance is less than the current distance in the table, update the table with the new distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | infinity | false   |\n| 2    | 0        | true    |\n| 3    | infinity | false   |\n| 4    | infinity | false   |\n| 5    | 1        | false   |\n| 6    | infinity | false   |\n| 7    | infinity | false   |\n| 8    | 1        | false   |\n| 9    | infinity | false   |\n| 10   | infinity | false   |\n| 11   | 1        | false   |\n| 12   | infinity | false   |\n| 13   | infinity | false   |\n| 14   | 1        | false   |\n| 15   | infinity | false   |\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 5. Mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each of the unvisited rooms that are connected to room 5 (rooms 2, 8, 11, and 14), calculate the distance from room 2 to that room (which is 2 for room 8 and room 11, and 3 for room 14). If the calculated distance plus the distance from room 2 to room 5 (which is 1) is less than the current distance in the table, update the table with the new distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | infinity | false   |\n| 2    | 0        | true    |\n| 3    | infinity | false   |\n| 4    | infinity | false   |\n| 5    | 1        | true    |\n| 6    | infinity | false   |\n| 7    | infinity | false   |\n| 8    | 1        | false   |\n| 9    | infinity | false   |\n| 10   | infinity | false   |\n| 11   | 1        | false   |\n| 12   | infinity | false   |\n| 13   | infinity | false   |\n| 14   | 2        | false   |\n| 15   | infinity | false   |\n\n6.

For each of the unvisited rooms that are connected to room 8 (rooms 2, 5, 11, and 14), calculate the distance from room 2 to that room (which is 3 for room 11 and room 14). If the calculated distance plus the distance from room 2 to room 8 (which is 1) is less than the current distance in the table, update the table with the new distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | infinity | false   |\n| 2    | 0        | true    |\n| 3    | infinity | false   |\n| 4    | infinity | false   |\n| 5    | 1        | true    |\n| 6    | infinity | false   |\n| 7    | infinity | false   |\n| 8    | 1        | true    |\n| 9    | infinity | false   |\n| 10   | infinity | false   |\n| 11   | 2        | false   |\n| 12   | infinity | false   |\n| 13   | infinity | false   |\n| 14   | 2        | true    |\n| 15   | infinity | false   |\n\n8.

For each of the unvisited rooms that are connected to room 11 (rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14), calculate the distance from room 2 to that room (which is 4 for room 14).
