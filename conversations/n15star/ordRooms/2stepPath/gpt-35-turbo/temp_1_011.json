            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to the starting vertex (room 1) and infinity to all other vertices.\n2. Set the starting vertex as current and mark it visited.\n3. For each neighbor of the current vertex, calculate the distance from the starting vertex through the current vertex. If this distance is less than the neighbor's current tentative distance, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. When we are done considering all the neighbors of the current vertex, mark the current vertex as visited. Among the unvisited vertices, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and make it the new current vertex. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the destination vertex (room 2) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 1 to room 2 as:\n1, 7, 11, 14, 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 11, 14, 2"
