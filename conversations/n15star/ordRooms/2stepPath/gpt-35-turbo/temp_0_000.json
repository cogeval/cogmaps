            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor, through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 1 and its neighbor is room 7, the tentative distance to room 7 is 1 (the distance from room 1 to room 7), plus the distance from room 7 to room 2 (which is not known yet). If this tentative distance is smaller than the current assigned distance to room 7 (which is infinity at this point), update the assigned distance to room 7 to the tentative distance.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. If there is no such room, we are done.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 2) has been visited. The shortest path can then be obtained by working backwards from room 2 to room 1, following the path of lowest total distance.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 2 is: 1, 11, 2.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 2."
