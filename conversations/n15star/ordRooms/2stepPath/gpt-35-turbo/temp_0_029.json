From room 9, we can reach room 3, room 6, and room 12. From room 12, we can reach room 3, room 6, and room 15. From room 15, we can reach room 4, room 6, and room 12. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can calculate the shortest path from room 6 to room 4 as follows: \n\n- Start at room 6 with a distance of 0. \n- Move to room 15 with a distance of 1. \n- Move to room 4 with a distance of 2. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 6 to room 4 is: \n\nAnswer: 6, 15, 4"
