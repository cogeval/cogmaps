Mark all rooms as unvisited except for room 5, and set the initial distance of each room to infinity except for room 5, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Among the unvisited rooms, select the room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 8 with a distance of 1.\n3. For each adjacent room that is unvisited, calculate the distance to that room by adding the distance to the current room (room 8) plus the weight of the edge between the two rooms. For example, the distance to room 11 is 1 (distance to current room) + 1 (weight of edge between room 8 and 11) = 2.\n4. If the calculated distance to a room is less than its current distance, update the distance.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all rooms are visited.\n6. The shortest path from room 5 to room 1 can be found by backtracking from room 1 to its previous room until we reach room 5.\n\nUsing the above algorithm, the shortest path from room 5 to room 1 is:\n\n5, 8, 11, 1\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 5, 8, 11, 1"
