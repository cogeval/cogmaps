Create a set of unvisited nodes and set the distance of each node to infinity except for room 1, which we set to 0. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the previous node for each visited node.\nUnvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\nDistances: {1:0, 2:inf, 3:inf, 4:inf, 5:inf, 6:inf, 7:inf, 8:inf, 9:inf, 10:inf, 11:inf, 12:inf, 13:inf, 14:inf, 15:inf}\nPrevious node: {}\n\n2. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance, which is room 1. Visit its neighbors and update their distances if they are shorter than their current distances.\nUnvisited nodes: {2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13}\nDistances: {1:0, 2:1, 3:inf, 4:inf, 5:inf, 6:inf, 7:1, 8:inf, 9:inf, 10:1, 11:1, 12:inf, 13:1, 14:inf, 15:inf}\nPrevious node: {2:1, 7:1, 10:1, 11:1, 13:1}\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes have been visited or the destination node (room 5) has been visited.\nUnvisited nodes: {3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15}\nDistances: {1:0, 2:1, 3:3, 4:2, 5:3, 6:inf, 7:1, 8:4, 9:4, 10:1, 11:1, 12:4, 13:1, 14:2, 15:5}\nPrevious node: {2:1, 7:1, 10:1, 11:1, 13:1, 4:7, 5:2, 8:3}\n\n4. To get the shortest path from room 1 to room 5, we can backtrack from room 5 to its previous node (room 2) and continue backtracking until we reach room 1.\nShortest path: 1, 2, 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 2, 5"
