Assign a tentative distance value to each room: 0 for room 1, and infinity for all other rooms.\n\n2. Set room 1 as the current room.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. For example, for room 1, we can reach room 7, 10, 11, and 13 with a distance of 1.\n\n4. When we finish calculating the tentative distances for all of the neighbors, mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new \"current room.\"\n\n6. Repeat step 3-5 until we visit all the rooms, or until the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms is infinity (which means there is no connection to the remaining unvisited rooms).\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 14 is:\n\n1 -> 11 -> 14\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \"Answer: 1, 11, 14\""
