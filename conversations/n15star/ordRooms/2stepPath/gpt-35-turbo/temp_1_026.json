Mark room 3 as visited and set its neighbors' distances to 1.\n3. From the unvisited neighbors of room 3, choose the one with the shortest distance (room 6) and mark it as visited. Update its neighbors' distances (rooms 9 and 8) to 2 and 3, respectively.\n4. From the unvisited neighbors of rooms 6, 9, and 8, choose the one with the shortest distance (room 5) and mark it as visited. The shortest path from room 3 to room 5 is 3-6-5, with a total distance of 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 5, including room 3, is:\n\nAnswer: 3,6,5"
