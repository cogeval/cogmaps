Create a set of unvisited nodes, initially containing all rooms except for room 3, and a dictionary of distances, initially setting the distance of room 3 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n2. While the set of unvisited nodes is not empty, choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance and mark it as visited. For all adjacent nodes that are still unvisited, calculate the distance to that node as the sum of the distance to the current node and the distance between the two nodes. If this calculated distance is less than the current distance to that node in the dictionary, update the dictionary.\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until the destination node (room 2) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 3 to room 2 is: 3, 8, 2. \n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 2."
