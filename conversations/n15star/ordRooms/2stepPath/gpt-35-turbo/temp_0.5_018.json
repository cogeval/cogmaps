            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 8 to room 11, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 8. Initially, set the distance of room 8 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    0\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 8 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 8, update its distance in the table if the distance through room 8 is shorter than its current distance. For example, room 14 has a distance of infinity, but we can reach it from room 8 with a distance of 1. So we update its distance to 1.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    0\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (room 14) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room connected to the current room (room 14), update its distance in the table if the distance through the current room is shorter than its current distance. For example, we can reach room 11 from room 14 with a distance of 1 (through room 8 and room 11), which is shorter than its current distance of infinity. So we update its distance to 1+1=2.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |    0\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |    2\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    1\n 15  |   inf\n```\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (room 11) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Since room 11 is the destination, we can stop here. The shortest path from room 8 to room 11 is: 8, 14, 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: `Answer: 8, 14, 11`."
