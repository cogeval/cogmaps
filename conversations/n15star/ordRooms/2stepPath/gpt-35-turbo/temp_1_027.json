Starting from room 3, we can calculate the shortest path to each of the other rooms and then choose the path with the smallest total weight.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 3 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 3, calculate the distance to that room as the weight of the edge between room 3 and the connected room.\n4. If the calculated distance is less than the current tentative distance of the connected room, update the tentative distance of the connected room to the calculated distance.\n5. Mark the room with the smallest tentative distance as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all unvisited rooms until room 14 is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 3 to room 14 is: 3, 8, 11, 14\n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 11, 14"
