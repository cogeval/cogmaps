Create a set of unvisited nodes and set the distance of all nodes to infinity except for room 6, which is set to 0.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (which is room 6 in this case) and visit all of its neighbors (rooms 9, 12, and 15).\n3. For each neighbor, calculate the distance to that neighbor by adding the distance to the current node (room 6) to the weight of the edge between the current node and the neighbor. If this distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update the distance of the neighbor to this smaller distance.\n4. Mark the current node as visited and repeat steps 2-3 for the unvisited neighbors until the destination node (room 4) is visited.\n5. Once the destination node is visited, backtrack from this node to the starting node (room 6) by selecting the previous node with the smallest distance until the starting node is reached. This gives us the shortest path from room 6 to room 4.\n\nAnswer: 6, 9, 12, 15, 4"
