Set the distance of room 7 to 0 and all other rooms to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |    0\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n```\n2. Mark room 7 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 10 is connected to room 7 and has a distance of 1. Update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |    0\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |    1\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |    1\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n```\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 10 with a distance of 1. Mark it as visited.\n5. For each room connected to room 10, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 13 is connected to room 10 and has a distance of 1. Update the table:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |    0\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |    1\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |    1\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |    2\n```\n6. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 13 with a distance of 1. Mark it as visited.\n7. For each room connected to room 13, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. In this case, there are no rooms connected to room 13 that have not been visited yet.\n8. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 15 with a distance of 2. Mark it as visited.\n9. We have reached our destination. The shortest path from room 7 to room 15 is 7, 10, 13, 15.\n \nAnswer: 7, 10, 13, 15"
