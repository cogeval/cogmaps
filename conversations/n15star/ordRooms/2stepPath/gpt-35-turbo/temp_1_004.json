Assign infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark room 1 as visited.\n3. For each room adjacent to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13), calculate the distance from room 1 to that room (which is 1). If this distance is shorter than the tentative distance currently assigned to the adjacent room, update the tentative distance to the shorter distance.\n4. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance (which is room 7 with a tentative distance of 1), and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each adjacent room of the current room (room 7) that hasn't been visited yet (rooms 1, 10, 11, and 13). Update tentative distances as necessary.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the next unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance (which is room 10 with a tentative distance of 1).\n7. Continue repeating steps 4-6 until room 2 is marked as visited.\n8. To get the shortest path, start at room 2 and follow the path of smallest tentative distances back to room 1. The shortest path is: 1, 7, 11, 14, 2.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 11, 14, 2"
