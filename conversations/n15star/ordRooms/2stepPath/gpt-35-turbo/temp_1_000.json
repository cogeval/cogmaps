Look at all the rooms that are connected to room 1 (rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13).\n3. Calculate the distance from room 1 to each of those rooms (the distance is 1 since we are only moving one room away).\n4. Choose the room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 11).\n5. Move to that room and mark it as visited.\n6. Look at all the rooms that are connected to the current room (room 11). This includes rooms 2, 5, 8, and 14.\n7. Calculate the distance from room 11 to each of those rooms. The distance from room 11 to room 2 is 2 (since we need to move through one more room).\n8. Choose the room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 2).\n9. Move to that room and mark it as visited.\n10. We have reached our destination (room 2).\n\nSo the shortest path from room 1 to room 2 is: 1, 11, 2\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 2"
