Starting from room 3, we can traverse the castle and keep track of the shortest distance to each room. Then, we can backtrack from room 15 to room 3 to find the shortest path. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following shortest distances from room 3 to each room:\n- Room 3: 0\n- Room 6: 1\n- Room 12: 1\n- Room 9: 1\n- Room 8: 2\n- Room 5: 3\n- Room 11: 3\n- Room 14: 3\n- Room 2: 4\n- Room 15: 4\n- Room 7: 5\n- Room 10: 5\n- Room 13: 5\n- Room 1: infinity\n- Room 4: infinity\n\nThus, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 6, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 6, 15"
