Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 2 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as the current room (room 2) and mark it as visited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to each neighbor is the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current room to that neighbor.\n4. If the tentative distance to a neighbor is less than its current distance, update the neighbor's distance to the tentative distance.\n5. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the current room. We repeat this process until the destination room (room 1) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 2 to room 1 as follows: 2 -> 11 -> 1. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 11, 1."
