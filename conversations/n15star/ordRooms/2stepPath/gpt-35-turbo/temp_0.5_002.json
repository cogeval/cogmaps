Create a list of unvisited rooms, and set the distance to each room to infinity except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. Set the previous room for each room to null.\n\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 1. \n\n3. For each neighbor of the selected room, calculate the distance from the starting room (room 1) to that neighbor through the selected room. If this distance is less than the current distance of the neighbor, update the distance and set the previous room for the neighbor to the selected room.\n\n4. Mark the selected room as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 5) is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 5 is: 1, 11, 5\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 5"
