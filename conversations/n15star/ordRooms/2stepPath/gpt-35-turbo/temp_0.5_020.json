Starting from room 8, we can follow the connections to the neighboring rooms and assign a tentative distance to each of them. Then, we choose the room with the shortest tentative distance and repeat the process until we reach room 9.\n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Set the distance of room 8 to 0 and all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Mark room 8 as visited.\n3. For each neighboring room of room 8 (rooms 14 and 5), assign a tentative distance of 1.\n4. Choose the room with the shortest tentative distance (room 14) and mark it as visited.\n5. For each neighboring room of room 14 (rooms 11 and 8), assign a tentative distance of 2.\n6. Choose the room with the shortest tentative distance (room 8) and mark it as visited.\n7. Since room 8 is the destination, we have found the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 8 to room 9 is:\n\nAnswer: 8, 14, 11, 9"
