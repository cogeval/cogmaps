Initially, the distance to room 5 is 0, and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 5, update its distance in the table if the distance through room 5 is shorter than its current distance.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | 1        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 1        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n\n4.
