Starting from room 14, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to the shortest path. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 14 which is set to 0. Create an empty set of visited rooms and a priority queue.\n2. Add room 14 to the priority queue.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Pop the room with the smallest distance from the priority queue. If the room is room 3, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n   b. For each neighboring room that has not been visited, calculate the distance to that room through the current room. If the distance is shorter than the previous distance, update the distance and the previous room. Add the neighboring room to the priority queue.\n   c. Mark the current room as visited.\n4. Once we have found the shortest path to room 3, we can backtrack from room 3 to room 14 using the previous room information.\n\nThe shortest path from room 14 to room 3 is: 14, 11, 2, 8, 3.\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 2, 8, 3."
