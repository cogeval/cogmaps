Starting from room 3, we can calculate the shortest distance to each of the connected rooms, and then move to the room with the shortest distance. We repeat this process until we reach room 15. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path: \n\n1. Set the distance of room 3 to 0, and the distance of all other rooms to infinity. \n2. From room 3, we can go to rooms 6, 8, 9, and 12. Calculate the distance from room 3 to each of these rooms: \n   - Distance to room 6: 1\n   - Distance to room 8: 1\n   - Distance to room 9: 1\n   - Distance to room 12: 1\n3. Move to the room with the shortest distance, which is either room 6, 8, 9, or 12. Let's say we move to room 8. \n4. From room 8, we can go to room 14. Calculate the distance from room 8 to room 14: \n   - Distance to room 14: 1\n5. Move to the room with the shortest distance, which is room 14. \n6. From room 14, we can go to room 15. Calculate the distance from room 14 to room 15: \n   - Distance to room 15: 1\n7. Move to room 15. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 8, 14, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 8, 14, 15."
