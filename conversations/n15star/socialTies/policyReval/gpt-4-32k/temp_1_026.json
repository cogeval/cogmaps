Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Noah -> Anisha -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit -> Alice = 5 (1 connection to Alice)\n2. Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Noah -> Anisha -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit -> Soheil -> Alice = 5 (1 connection to Alice)\n3. Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Noah -> Anisha -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit -> Solomon -> Paul -> Alice = 5 (1 connection to Alice)\n4. Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice = 5 (1 connection to Alice)\n5. Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Noah -> Anisha -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit -> Solomon -> Soheil -> Alice = 5 (1 connection to Alice)\n\nAll the paths have the same reward of 5.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Alice"
