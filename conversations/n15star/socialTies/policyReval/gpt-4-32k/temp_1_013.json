Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for connecting with Alice. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."
