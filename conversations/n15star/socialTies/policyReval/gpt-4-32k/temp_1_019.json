Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for connecting with Alice. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Gongxue -> Solomon -> Solomon -> Soheil -> Alice\n\nNow, we will calculate the total reward of each path:\n\n1. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n2. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n3. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n4. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n5. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n6. 1 connection with Alice: reward = 5\n\nAll paths give the same reward, but path 4 has the shortest connection from Vivian to Alice:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue, Alice"
