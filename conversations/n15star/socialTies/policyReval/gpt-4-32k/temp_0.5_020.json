Therefore, Kim is the one who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. From the information provided, Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nKim is directly connected to Wim, Wei, and Pam. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would involve a scholar who is directly connected to both Amir and Kim. \n\nFrom the information provided, Puja is directly connected to both Amir and Kim. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be Amir -> Puja -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
