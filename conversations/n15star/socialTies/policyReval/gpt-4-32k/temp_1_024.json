Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are their connections:\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari doesn't have any additional connections.\nPuja is connected to Pam.\n\nFrom Amir's connections, none is directly linked to either Kim or Max, who are the book donors. So, I must go a step further.\n\nReviewing the connections of the individuals connected to Amir's friends:\n\nMoin is connected to Pari, but Pari doesn't lead to either Kim or Max.\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari. Both Moin and Pari don't lead to either Kim or Max.\nPuja is connected to Pam. Pam, in turn, is connected to Kim, who is donating the most books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."
