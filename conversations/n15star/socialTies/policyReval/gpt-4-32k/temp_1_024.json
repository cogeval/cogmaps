From Salma, Shanshan, or Vadim, find a connection to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, or Gongxue, as they are all connected to Alice.\n4. Check the connections for each option:\n\n   a) Salma connects with Solomon or Noah.\n   b) Shanshan connects with Noah.\n   c) Vadim connects with Noah.\n\n5. From the options above, Solomon, Soheil, and Gongxue are connected to Alice, so choose the connection path that yields the most reward:\n\n   a) Salma to Solomon to Alice (reward: 5)\n   b) Shanshan to Noah to Salma to Solomon to Alice (reward: 5)\n   c) Vadim to Noah to Salma to Solomon to Alice (reward: 5)\n\n6. All paths yield the same reward, but the shortest one is through Salma and Solomon.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Solomon, Alice"
