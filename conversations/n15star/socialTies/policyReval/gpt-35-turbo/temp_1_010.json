Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nLet's break down the connections and keep track of the paths:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Path: Amir\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Paths: Amir - Reza\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Paths: Amir - Reza - Moin\n4. Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n   - Paths: Amir - Reza - Moin - Pari\n5. Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Paths: Amir - Puja\n   \nNow, we have reached the end of the connections. Let's check the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\n- Amir: Not donating any books\n- Reza: Not donating any books\n- Moin: Not donating any books\n- Pari: Not donating any books\n- Puja: Not donating any books\n- Pam: Not donating any books\n\nNone of the scholars connected to Amir are donating any books. Since we haven't reached the person who is donating the maximum number of books, we need to explore further.\n\nBased on the given connections, none of the scholars connected to Amir are connected to anyone else who is donating books. Therefore, there is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books."
