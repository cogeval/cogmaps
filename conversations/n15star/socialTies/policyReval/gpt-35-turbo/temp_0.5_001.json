Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is donating the maximum number of books. Since Amir is not donating any books, we move to the next step.\n3. Explore the scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. None of them are donating the maximum number of books, so we move to the next step.\n5. Explore the scholars connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, and Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. None of them are donating the maximum number of books, so we move to the next step.\n7. Explore the scholars connected to Moin, Pari, and Pam: Moin is not connected to any other scholars, Pari is not connected to any other scholars, and Pam is connected to Kim.\n8. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. Kim is not donating the maximum number of books, so we move to the next step.\n9. Explore the scholars connected to Kim: Kim is connected to Pam.\n10. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. Pam is not donating the maximum number of books, so we move to the next step.\n11. Explore the scholars connected to Pam: Pam is not connected to any other scholars.\n12. Since we have explored all possible paths and have not found the person donating the maximum number of books, we conclude that there is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the final outcome is: Answer: There is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
