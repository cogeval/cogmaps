Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each visited scholar is donating. \n\nWe will continue this process by exploring the connections of the visited scholars until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store the scholars we need to visit. Initially, add Amir to the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_books` to 0 to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n5. Initialize a variable `max_donator` to an empty string to keep track of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Start a loop that continues until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue and mark them as visited.\n   - Check if the current scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If so, update `max_books` and `max_donator`.\n   - Get all the connections of the current scholar.\n   - For each connection:\n     - If the connection has not been visited before, enqueue the connection and mark it as visited.\n     - Update the number of books donated by the connection in the dictionary.\n7. Once the loop finishes, we will have the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n8. To obtain this path, we can start from `max_donator` and backtrack using the connections stored in the dictionary until we reach Amir.\n9. Finally, we will have the names of the scholars in the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin"
