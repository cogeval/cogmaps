Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue to keep track of the scholars to visit.\n2. Enqueue Amir as the starting point.\n3. Create an empty visited list to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty path list to store the current path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Add the scholar to the current path list.\n     - Check if the scholar is donating books:\n       - If yes, store the current path and the number of books donated.\n     - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar.\n       - Update their path by appending the current scholar to their path.\n6. Once all scholars have been visited, find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and retrieve the shortest path from Amir to that scholar.\n7. Return the shortest path in the required format.\n\nLet's go through the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Create a queue: []\n2. Enqueue Amir: [Amir]\n3. Mark Amir as visited: [Amir]\n4. Amir is not donating books, continue.\n5. Enqueue the connected scholars of Amir: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n6. Update their paths: [Amir->Reza, Amir->Moin, Amir->Pari, Amir->Puja]\n7. Dequeue Reza: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n8. Mark Reza as visited: [Moin, Pari, Puja, Reza]\n9. Reza is not donating books, continue.\n10. Enqueue the connected scholars of Reza: [Moin, Pari]\n11. Update their paths: [Moin->Reza, Pari->Reza]\n12. Dequeue Moin: [Pari, Moin]\n13. Mark Moin as visited: [Pari, Moin, Puja, Reza]\n14. Moin is not donating books, continue.\n15. Enqueue the connected scholars of Moin: [Pari]\n16. Update their paths: [Pari->Moin]\n17. Dequeue Pari: [Moin, Puja]\n18. Mark Pari as visited: [Moin, Puja, Pari, Reza]\n19. Pari is not donating books, continue.\n20. Enqueue the connected scholars of Pari: [Moin]\n21. Update their paths: [Moin->Pari]\n22. Dequeue Puja: [Moin]\n23. Mark Puja as visited: [Moin, Puja, Pari, Reza]\n24. Puja is donating books, store the current path and the number of books donated.\n25. Update the current shortest path and maximum number of books donated.\n26. Since there are no more connected scholars of Puja, continue.\n27. Dequeue Moin: []\n28. Dequeue Pari: []\n29. Dequeue Reza: []\n30. The queue is empty, all scholars have been visited.\n31. The scholar donating the maximum number of books is Kim with 50 books.\n32. The shortest path from Amir to Kim is [Amir, Puja, Kim].\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
