Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars:\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n\n2. Initialize a queue with Amir as the starting node.\n3. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a path dictionary to store the shortest path from each scholar.\n5. Initialize a max_books variable to 0, representing the current maximum number of books donated.\n6. Initialize a max_books_scholar variable to an empty string, representing the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\n7. Start the breadth-first search algorithm:\n   1. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   2. Check if the current scholar is the maximum book donor. If so, update the max_books and max_books_scholar variables.\n   3. Iterate through the connections of the current scholar:\n      - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n        - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n        - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n        - Update the path dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the connected scholar as the value.\n\n8. Once the queue is empty, we have found the shortest path to the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Extract the shortest path by following the values in the path dictionary from Amir to the max_books_scholar.\n   - Concatenate the scholar names in the shortest path, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
