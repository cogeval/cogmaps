Starting from Amir, we will visit each connected scholar and check if they are donating books. We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if any of Amir's connections are donating books.\n3. If yes, move to that person.\n4. If no, check if any of Amir's connections have connections who are donating books.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing the given information, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAmir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari is not donating any books.\n\nNone of Amir's immediate connections are donating books. Let's move on to the next level of connections.\n\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari is not donating any books.\n\nLet's move to the next level of connections.\n\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari is not donating any books.\n\nWe have reached the end of the connections from Amir. None of the scholars connected to Amir are donating any books. \n\nTherefore, there is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: None"

Check if Amir is donating any books. Since Amir is not donating any books, move on to the next level of connections.\n3. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are donating books.\n5. Reza is not donating any books.\n6. Moin is donating 100 books. We have found the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n7.
