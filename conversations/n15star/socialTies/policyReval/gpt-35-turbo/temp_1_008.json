Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we check if any of the immediate connections of Amir is donating the maximum number of books (in this case, 50).\n   - Amir's immediate connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - None of them are donating the maximum number of books, so we move to the next step.\n\n2. We expand our search to Amir's immediate connections and check if any of their immediate connections is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Reza's immediate connections are Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin is not donating any books, so we skip Moin and consider Pari.\n   - Pari is not donating any books, so we skip Pari as well.\n\n3. We continue expanding the search until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin, and Moin is not donating any books.\n   - Reza is not connected to anyone else, so we move to the next connection of Amir.\n\n4. We check the next connection of Amir, which is Puja.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam, and Kim is donating the maximum number of books (50).\n   - We have found the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
