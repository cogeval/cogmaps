Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to anyone who is donating books. If yes, go to step 4.\n3. If Amir is not connected to anyone who is donating books, check if any of Amir's connections are connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, go to step 4.\n4. If there is a connection from Amir (or Amir's connections) to someone who is donating books, add that person to the path and mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the maximum number of books is reached.\n6. Return the path.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is not connected to anyone who is donating books.\n3. Amir's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are connected to anyone who is donating books.\n4. We move to the next level of connections. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is not connected to anyone who is donating books. Pari is also not connected to anyone who is donating books.\n5. We move to the next level of connections. Moin and Pari do not have any further connections.\n6. We move to the next level of connections. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is donating books, but she is not the person donating the maximum number of books.\n7. We move to the next level of connections. Pam is not connected to anyone who is donating books.\n8. We move to the next level of connections. Puja and Pam do not have any further connections.\n9. We have reached the end of the search without finding the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
