Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will traverse the connections and keep track of the number of books each person is donating. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the name of the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n      - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the name of the person.\n   c. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   d. Mark the connected scholars as visited.\n6. Return the names of the scholars visited in the order they were visited, separated by commas.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Max"
