Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Let's explore the other connections:\n\nAmir is connected to Reza, Moin, and Puja.\nReza is connected to Moin.\nMoin is not connected to any other person who is donating books.\n\nAgain, we don't have a direct connection to someone donating books through Moin.
