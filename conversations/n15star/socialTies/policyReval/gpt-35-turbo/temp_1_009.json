Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will also create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n\n1. Set Amir as the starting point.\n2. Initialize an empty queue.\n3. Initialize an empty visited set to keep track of scholars already visited.\n4. Initialize a books dictionary with the initial values of 0 books donated for each scholar.\n5. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    b. Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the previously tracked maximum.\n    c. If yes, update the maximum number of books donated.\n    d. If not, continue to the next scholar.\n    e. Check all the connections of the current scholar:\n        - If a connection is not in the visited set, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n        - If a connection has not donated any books yet, add the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n        - If a connection has already donated books, check if the current scholar's donation is higher.
