Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim.\n7. Kim is donating 50 books.\n\nBased on this information, the shortest path from Amir to Kim (who is donating the maximum number of books) is as follows:\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Answer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim."
