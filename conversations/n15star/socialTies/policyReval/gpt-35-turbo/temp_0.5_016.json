Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books each person is donating. We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person who is donating them.\n   - Check the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the queue is empty.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given scenario:\n\nStarting from Amir, we explore his connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n- Reza is not donating any books.\n- Moin is not donating any books.\n- Pari is not donating any books.\n- Puja is connected to Pam, who is not donating any books.\n\nSince none of Amir's connections are donating any books, we move on to the next level of connections.\n\nNext, we explore the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja:\n- Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n- Moin is connected to Pari.\n- Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n- Puja is connected to Pam, who is not donating any books.\n\nSince none of these scholars are donating any books, we move on to the next level of connections.\n\nNext, we explore the connections of Moin, Pari, and Pam:\n- Moin is not connected to anyone else.\n- Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n- Pam is not connected to anyone else.\n\nSince none of these scholars are donating any books, we move on to the next level of connections.\n\nNext, we explore the connections of Pari:\n- Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n\nSince Pari is not connected to anyone else, we have explored all the connections starting from Amir.\n\nThe person who is donating the maximum number of books is Max, with a donation of 10 books. However, Max is not directly connected to Amir or any of his connections.\n\nTherefore, there is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books within the given connections.\n\nAnswer: No path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
