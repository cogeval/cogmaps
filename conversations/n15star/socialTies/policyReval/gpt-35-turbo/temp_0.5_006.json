Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check if Amir is connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the next person from the queue.\n   b. Check if this person is donating books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this person.\n   c. If not, add all the neighbors of this person who haven't been visited yet to the queue.\n4. If no path is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating books, so add them to the queue.\n3. Queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n4. Dequeue Reza.\n5. Reza is not donating books. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Add them to the queue.\n6. Queue: Moin, Pari, Puja, Moin, Pari\n7. Dequeue Moin.\n8. Moin is not donating books. Moin is connected to Pari. Add Pari to the queue.\n9. Queue: Pari, Puja, Pari\n10. Dequeue Pari.\n11. Pari is not donating books. Pari is connected to Puja. Add Puja to the queue.\n12. Queue: Puja, Puja\n13. Dequeue Puja.\n14. Puja is donating books. The shortest path from Amir to Puja is Amir, Puja.\n15. Answer: Amir, Puja"

However, this time we need to update the information about book donations before starting the search.\n\nGiven that Moin is now donating 100 books, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Update the donation information:\n   - Moin is donating 100 books.\n   - Kim is donating 50 books.\n   - Max is donating 10 books.\n3. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Among them, Moin is donating the maximum number of books. So, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is just Amir and Moin.\n4. Answer: Amir, Moin"
