Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (in this case, Max), stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet, and add them to the visited set.\n   - Update the path to include the current scholar.\n4.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (in this case, Moin with 100 books), stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet, and add them to the visited set.\n   - Sort the scholars in the queue based on the number of books they are donating in descending order.\n   - Update the path to include the current scholar.\n4.
