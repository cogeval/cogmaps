Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to anyone who is donating more books than the current maximum (which is 0 at the beginning).\n3. If yes, update the current maximum number of books and the corresponding person's name.\n4. If not, explore Amir's connections and enqueue them in the order they are connected.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we find the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's go through the process:\n\nStarting from Amir, the initial maximum number of books is 0.\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei -> Kim (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei -> Kim -> Ian (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei -> Kim -> Ian -> Nisha (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei -> Kim -> Ian -> Nisha -> Sara (0 books) - not higher than current maximum\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Wei -> Kim -> Ian -> Nisha -> Sara -> Max (10 books) - higher than current maximum\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim, Ian, Nisha, Sara, Max"
