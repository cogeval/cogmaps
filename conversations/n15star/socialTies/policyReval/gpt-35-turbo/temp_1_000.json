While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar (excluding the ones already visited) into the queue.\n   - Keep track of the path taken from Amir to the current scholar.\n4.
