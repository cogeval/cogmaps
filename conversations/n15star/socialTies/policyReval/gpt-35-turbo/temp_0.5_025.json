Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add him to the visited set.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books = 0 and a variable max_books_scholar = None.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n     - Check if this scholar is donating more books than max_books. If so, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n     - If the scholar is not the person donating the maximum number of books, enqueue all their connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n     - Add the current scholar to the visited set.\n5. Once the queue is empty, we have found the person donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Trace back the shortest path from Amir to this scholar using the visited set.\n7. Return the list of scholar names in the order of the shortest path, including Amir.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
