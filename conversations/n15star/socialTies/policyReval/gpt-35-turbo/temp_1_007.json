Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will traverse the connections to find the person who has the most donated books.\n2. We will use a breadth-first search algorithm to explore the connections of each scholar, while keeping track of the number of donated books for each person.\n3. We will visit each connected scholar only once to avoid redundant paths.\n4. At each step, we will prioritize visiting scholars who are connected to the current scholar but have not been visited before.\n5. We will continue this process until we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of donated books.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps and find the shortest path:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim.\n7. Kim is connected to Max.\n\nThe scholar who is donating the maximum number of books is Max. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Max is:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim, Max"
