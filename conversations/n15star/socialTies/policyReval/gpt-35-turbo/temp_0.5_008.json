Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Now, we need to find the shortest path to the person donating the maximum number of books. We know that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Since Kim is donating more books, we need to find the shortest path to Kim.\n\n7. We visit Reza and find that he is connected to Moin and Pari. Both Moin and Pari have already been visited, so we skip them.\n8. We visit Moin and find that he is connected to Pari. Pari has already been visited, so we skip her.\n9. We visit Pari and find that she has no connections.\n10. We visit Puja and find that she is connected to Pam. Pam has already been visited, so we skip her.\n\nAt this point, we have visited all the scholars directly connected to Amir and their connections. We haven't found Kim yet, so we need to continue searching.\n\n11. We visit Moin and find that he is connected to Pari. Pari has already been visited, so we skip her.\n\nSince we have visited all the scholars and their connections, and we haven't found Kim, it means that there is no path from Amir to Kim. Therefore, there is no shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
