Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore all the connected scholars in each step.\n\nHere are the steps we will follow:\n\nStep 1: Initialize a queue and visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n\nStep 2: While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\nStep 3: Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n\nStep 4: Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Proceed to step 6.\n\nStep 5: If the scholar is not donating the maximum number of books, enqueue all the connected but unvisited scholars of the current scholar. Mark them as visited.\n\nStep 6: Construct the shortest path by tracing back from the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books to Amir using the visited set.\n\nBased on the given connections and donation information, let's start:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
