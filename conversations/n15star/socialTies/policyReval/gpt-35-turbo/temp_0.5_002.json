Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to a queue.\n3. If the queue is empty, there are no scholars connected to Amir who are donating books. Stop the search.\n4. If the queue is not empty, remove the first scholar from the queue and check if they are donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n5. If the scholar is not donating the maximum number of books, add all their connected scholars (who have not been visited before) to the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the maximum book donor is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nQueue: [Amir]\nVisited: [Amir]\n\nStep 2: Check if Amir is donating the maximum number of books. No.\n\nStep 3: Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books.

No.\n\nStep 9: Add all connected scholars of Pari to the queue: None.\nQueue: []\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari]\n\nThe queue is empty, and none of the visited scholars are donating the maximum number of books. Therefore, there is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: No path found."
