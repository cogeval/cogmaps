Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between them will be represented as edges.\n\nBased on the given information, we have the following connections:\n\nAmir -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim -> Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj -> Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei -> Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha -> Ian, Sara, Max\nReza -> Moin, Pari\nKim -> Pam\nIan -> Sara, Max\nMoin -> Pari\nPuja -> Pam\nSara -> Max\n\nWith this graph in mind, we can perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from Amir to find the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nBFS Steps:\n1. Add Amir to the queue.\n2. Set the visited flag of Amir to true.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - If yes, return the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n   - If no, add all the unvisited connections of the current scholar to the queue.\n   - Set the visited flag of the current scholar to true.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar is found who is donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow let's perform the BFS starting from Amir to find the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
