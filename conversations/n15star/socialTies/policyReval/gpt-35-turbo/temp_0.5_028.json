Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check if any of the connected scholars have a connection to someone who is donating books. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, and Pari is connected to Puja.\n4.
