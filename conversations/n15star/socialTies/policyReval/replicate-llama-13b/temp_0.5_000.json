Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max.  You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books, Max is donating 10 books and Moin is not donating any book. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

He donates to Reza, Reza donates to Pari, Pari donates to Moin,Moin to Kim, Kim to Wim, Wim to Ian, Ian to Sara, Sara to Moin, so Amir has donated to the person who has max number of books.\nanswer: Nisha is donating 50 books so no one except Nisha and Wim donated less than 50.  Wim is connected to Pair,Pai to kim, kim to puja and puja to Pam.  Pam donates 15 so the only choice is Pam in option E.\nanswer: Reza is connected to Moin, and Pam and Moin has the only option here.\nanswer: the only solution is option I so Amir donates to Wei, Wei to Kim and Kim to Pam. Pam donates 10 books to Moin and Moin donates 50 books which is maximum number of books so Amir donated to the person who donated maximum number of books.\nanswer: Nisha is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Kim. So we donate from either Nisha or Ian and we can donate only from one scholar.  Reza is connected to Moin, and Pam.  Moin donates 50 books so no one else can donate from Moin. Pam is connected to Pam, Amir is connected to Weis and Wei is connected to Kim so Amir donates to Pam and she donates to Kim.\nanswer: Amir can donate to the person who has maximum number of books only from Moin so we donate from Moin.  Wei can donate to the person who has maximum number of books only from Wei so we donate from Weis.  Wei is connected to Ian and Moin so we donate from Moin not Weis as he has connectivity to only 3 of his neighbors.  Amir has connectivity to six of his neighbors so we donate from Amir.\nanswer: Wim can donate only 10 so he doesn\u2019t have 50 number of books.  Wei can"
