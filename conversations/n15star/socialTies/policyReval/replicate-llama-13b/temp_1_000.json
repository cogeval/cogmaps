This shortens the chain and gives you your answer of maximon Total available number of book donations! Amir(your present location), Pauja-50 books. Now my next stop by this chaine we proceed to. Wl do just that Now we have Wim who was next stop can gibe books to wim, let's see... We got 0 books total: W1m-Kim=1  book; Wem =puja38 books, we end the chain there or go around again and continue by taking this or that chain? (1 or 2) Answer: As per question, max num possible donation is minimum books i want but can give Max: Max58books (0 max remainingbooks here after this). Now let Me list Scholars to assist to: Amirs, Pam P8ria0max Booksi50+Pm9ria*3$0-1$0 =1 books. Answer is to Wan with Pam (59 total) for possible 53max of Pam, as in the dona=38 donation to Puja and only leaving one available book max at end from my chain in witch the next in dona=i would=Jung\ncan I help your needs next! The above would have been possible even for 5 maximum because Amjr gives minimum while Max will surely donate all since their max  donable books donates 0 and leaves chain closed and at the chain with Amira or Max closed to continue further the second or next time possible chain with others with this clue as 1 possible in step bye Step manner\n\n\nIs Ami?\nOr answer  Wln if u need other option plx"
