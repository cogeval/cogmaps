Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max.  You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books, Max is donating 10 books and Moin is not donating any book.

Find all the scholars who are connected to Amir.\n2. Find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books from the list of scholars who are connected to Amir.\n3. Find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nThe following is the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books:\n\n```\nAmir, Reza, Moin\n```\n\nThis is the shortest path because it is the only path that has a length of 2. The other paths have a length of 3 or more.\n\nHere is the regular expression that matches the answer:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThe answer matches this regular expression because it is a list of scholar names separated by commas. The first name in the list is Amir, and the last name in the list is Moin.\n\nHere is the answer in a format that matches the regular expression:\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin\n```"
