Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Therefore, Kim is the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nStarting from Amir, we can see that Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. But Kim is not in this group. Hence, we need to check the scholars Amir is connected to.\n\nLet's check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari has no further connections mentioned.\nPuja is connected to Pam.\n\nNone of them is directly connected to Kim. \n\nLet's move one step further and check the connections of these scholars.\n\nPam is connected to Kim. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the most books is Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nTherefore, the list of scholar names in order, starting from Amir, is Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."
