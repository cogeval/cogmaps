In this case, it's Kim who is donating 50 books.\n\nNext, figure out the connections starting from Amir.\n\nThe people that Amir is directly connected to are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nKim is not directly connected to Amir, so must go further along the chain.\n\nKim is directly connected to Wei, Wim and Pam.\n\nOut of Wei, Wim and Pam, only Wim is directly connected to another person Amir is connected to, which is Puja.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja and Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim."
