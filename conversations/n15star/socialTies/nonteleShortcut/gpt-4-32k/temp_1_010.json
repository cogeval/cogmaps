Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Considering the donations, Kim is donating the most books with a count of 50.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Kim, we first identify the connections of Amir, which are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. From these connections, we evaluate the paths of each scholar to Kim:\n\n1. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari but not to Kim, thus we skip Reza.\n\n2. Moin is connected to Pari but not to Kim, so we skip Moin.\n\n3. Pari is not connected to Kim, thus we skip Pari.\n\n4. Puja, however, is connected to Kim. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, the scholar donating the maximum number of books, is through Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
