Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We know that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Hence, the person who is donating the most books is Kim.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the connections: Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Determine the shortest path: We have to find the shortest route from Amir to Kim. \nKim is not directly connected with Amir, so we have to find a scholar who is connected both with Amir and Kim. Looking at the connections, it is clear that Puja is connected with both Amir and Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim goes through Puja.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer in the desired format.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

Since Eva has the same connections as Pam, Eva is also connected to Wim, Wei, Puja, and Kim.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Amir's connections: Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, and now Eva (through marriage).\n\nStep 4: Determine the shortest path: The person who is donating the most books is Kim. Since Eva is directly connected to Kim and Amir is directly connected to Eva, the shortest path from Amir to Kim now goes through Eva.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer in the desired format.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Eva, Kim."
