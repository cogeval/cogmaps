Gongxue, Soheil (new connection)\n\nStarting from Vivian, we can connect to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, or Gongxue. We will try to find the most rewarding path by exploring each option.\n\nOption 1: Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Alice\nOption 2: Vivian -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Alice\nOption 3: Vivian -> Vadim -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Alice\nOption 4: Vivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Alice\n\nComparing the options, Option 4 has the shortest path with the least number of connections, which usually means a higher reward.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Alice"
