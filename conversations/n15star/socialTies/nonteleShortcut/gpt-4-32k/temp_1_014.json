Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nNext, check if Kim is among Amir's connections. She isn't, so continue to the next step.\n\nThen, check if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Kim. Among Amir's connections, Puja is connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is Amir to Puja to Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
