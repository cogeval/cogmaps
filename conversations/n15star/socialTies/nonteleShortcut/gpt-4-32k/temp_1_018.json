The goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nStep 2: Analyze the information given. We have connections among various scholars and we know who is donating the books and in what quantity. Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. \n\nStep 3: Since Kim is donating the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Amir's connections. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nStep 5: Analyze these scholars' connections and find if any of them is directly or indirectly connected to Kim. \n\nStep 6: We see that Puja is directly connected to Kim.\n\nStep 7: The shortest path from Amir to Kim will be through Puja.\n\nStep 8: Form the list of scholars in order, from Amir to Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
