Looking at the connections, we see that Amir is not directly connected to Kim, so we need to find a scholar that Amir is connected to and who is also connected to Kim.\n\n4. From the given information, we can see that Puja is connected to Kim and Amir is connected to Puja.\n\n5. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nFollowing these steps, the scholar names in order starting from Amir are Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."
