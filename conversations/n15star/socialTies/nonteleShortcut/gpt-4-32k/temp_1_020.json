Soheil from Group 2 is connected to Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil (Group 3).\n4. Anisha from Group 3 is connected to Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha (Group 4).\n\nThe connection path with the most reward would involve connecting through all the groups. Therefore, the connection path from Vivian should include representatives from each group:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Anisha"
