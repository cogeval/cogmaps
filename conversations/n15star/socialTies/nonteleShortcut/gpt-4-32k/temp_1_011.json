Salma is connected to Vivian, Shanshan, Vadim, Noah, and Anisha.\n3. Shanshan is connected to Vivian, Salma, Vadim, Noah, and Anisha.\n4. Vadim is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, and Noah.\n5. Gongxue is connected to Vivian, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Alice, and now Soheil.\n6. Paul is connected to Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice.\n7. Solomon is connected to Paul, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice, and Abdul.\n8. Soheil is connected to Paul, Solomon, Gongxue, Alice, Pierre, Abdul, and Durga.\n9. Alice is connected to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Durga.\n10. Pierre is connected to Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil.\n11. Abdul is connected to Pierre, Durga, Ajit, and Solomon.\n12. Durga is connected to Pierre, Abdul, Ajit, Soheil, and Alice.\n13. Ajit is connected to Pierre, Abdul, Durga, and Anisha.\n14. Anisha is connected to Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Ajit, and Durga.\n15. Noah is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha.\n\nSince we are asked to find the connection path from Vivian, let's start with her connections: Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue. Among these, Gongxue has the most direct connections to the others.\n\nSo, we can build the following path, maximizing the connections and rewards:\n\nVivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Alice -> Durga -> Ajit -> Anisha -> Noah -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Alice, Durga, Ajit, Anisha, Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim"
