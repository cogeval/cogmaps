Consider the initial groups: \n   - Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue (Group A)\n   - Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice (Group B)\n   - Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil (Group C)\n   - Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha (Group D)\n   - Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice (Group E)\n   - Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha (Group F)\n   - Salma, Shanshan, Vadim (Group G)\n3. Vivian is in Group A, so the next step is to find connections between Group A and other groups.\n4. Gongxue in Group A is connected to Soheil in Group C and Alice in Group E.\n5. Soheil and Alice are also connected.\n6. From Soheil or Alice, find the next strongest connection to another group.\n7. Soheil in Group C is connected to Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Pierre.\n8. Alice in Group E is connected to Solomon, Soheil, and Gongxue.\n\nSince Group C has more connections than Group E, the most rewarding path would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Pierre"
