Evaluate the rewards associated with each path.\n4. Select the path with the highest reward.\n\nFrom the connections given, we can determine the following paths from Vivian to Soheil:\n\nPath 1: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Solomon, Soheil\nPath 2: Vivian, Gongxue, Alice, Solomon, Soheil\nPath 3: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil\n\nNow we evaluate the rewards for each path:\n- Path 1 has 9 connections.\n- Path 2 has 5 connections.\n- Path 3 has 3 connections.\n\nThe path with the least number of connections will yield the most reward, as fewer connections mean stronger relationships. \n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil"
