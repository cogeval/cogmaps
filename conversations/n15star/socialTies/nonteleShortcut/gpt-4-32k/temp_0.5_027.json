Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

In this case, it is Kim who is donating 50 books, which is more than Max who is donating 10 books.\n\nNext, I will find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. From the information given, Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nKim is connected to Wei, Raj, and Wei. But none of these scholars are directly connected to Amir. \n\nHowever, Kim is also connected to Pam and Wim. Wim is also connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Amir. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be Amir -> Puja -> Wim -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim"
