We start from Vivian and proceed to find the most rewarding path.\n\n1. Start with Vivian in Group 1.\n2. Connect to Salma or Shanshan or Vadim (all are in Group 1 and Group 4).\n3. Connect to Anisha (in Group 4 and Group 6).\n4. Connect to Abdul or Durga or Ajit (all are in Group 6 and Group 3).\n5. Connect to Soheil (in Group 3 and Group 2).\n6. Connect to Alice or Gongxue (all are in Group 2 and Group 5).\n7. Connect to Solomon (in Group 5).\n\nFollowing this path, we can connect Vivian to 11 different students.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha, Abdul, Soheil, Alice, Solomon"
