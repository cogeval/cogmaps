Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

The task is to determine the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books, which in this case is Kim.\n\nStep 2: Identify the connections of Amir. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nStep 3: Analyze which among these scholars is directly or indirectly connected to Kim. \n\n- Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari, none of whom are connected to Kim.\n- Moin is connected to Pari, who also is not connected to Kim.\n- Pari does not have any connections other than those mentioned already.\n- Puja is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Kim.\n\nStep 4: Thus, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja and Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
