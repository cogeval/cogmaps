Identify connections:\n- Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue are all connected.\n- Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected.\n- Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are connected.\n- Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected.\n- Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected.\n- Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected.\n- Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected.\n- Soheil is connected to Alice.\n- Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected.\n- Shanshan is connected to Vadim.\n- Gongxue is connected to Alice.\n- Ajit is connected to Anisha.\n- Gongxue is now connected to Soheil.\n\n2. Determine the shortest and most rewarding path starting from Vivian:\n- Vivian is directly connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n- From Gongxue, we can reach Soheil (new connection) and Alice.\n- Soheil is connected to more students (Solomon, Paul, Pierre, Abdul, and Durga) than Alice.\n\nThe connection path that yields the most reward from Vivian is:\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil"
