Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, save the scholar's name as the current maximum donor.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark the connected scholars as visited.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the queue is empty.\n5. Return the shortest path from Amir to the maximum donor, including Amir.\n\nNow let's go through the steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the maximum donor:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Dequeue Reza. Enqueue Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Dequeue Moin. Enqueue Pari.\n5. Dequeue Pari. Enqueue Puja.\n6. Dequeue Puja. Enqueue Pam.\n7. Dequeue Pam.
