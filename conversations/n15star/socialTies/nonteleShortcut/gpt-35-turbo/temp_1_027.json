Starting from Amir, we check if any of Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja) are donating books.\n2. None of Amir's connections are donating books, so we move to the next level of connections.\n3. At the second level, we check the connections of Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja).\n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but neither of them is donating books. Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n5. Moin is connected to Pari, but Pari is not donating books. Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n6. Puja is connected to Pam, but Pam is not donating the maximum number of books. Puja is not connected to any other scholars.\n7.
