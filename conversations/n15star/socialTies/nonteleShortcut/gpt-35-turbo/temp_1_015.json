Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create a queue to store the scholars in the order they are visited.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Initialize the queue with Amir and add Amir to the visited set.\n5. Initialize the maximum number of books donated as 0.\n6. Initialize the scholar with the maximum number of books donated as None.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   7.1 Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   7.2 If the number of books donated by this scholar is greater than the maximum number of books donated so far, update the maximum number of books donated and the scholar with the maximum number of books donated.\n   7.3 If the current scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books, stop the search.\n   7.4 Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar (based on the given connections), if the connected scholar has not been visited:\n      7.4.1 Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      7.4.2 Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n8.
