Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to a queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. If not, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any other scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nQueue: [Amir]\nPath: [Amir]\n\nStep 2: Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 3: Dequeue Amir.\nQueue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\nPath: [Amir]\n\nStep 4: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.

None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 8: Dequeue Reza.\nQueue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\nPath: [Amir, Reza]\n\nStep 9: Moin is connected to Pari. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 10: Pari is not connected to any scholars who are donating books.\n\nStep 11: Puja is connected to Pam. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 12: Dequeue Moin.\nQueue: [Pari, Puja]\nPath: [Amir, Reza, Moin]\n\nStep 13: Pari is not connected to any scholars who are donating books.\n\nStep 14: Puja is connected to Pam.
