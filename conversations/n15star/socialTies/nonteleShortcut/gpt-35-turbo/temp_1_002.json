Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will also keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize the distance from Amir to himself as 0 and the number of books donated by Amir as 0.\n4. Start a loop while the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating books and update the maximum number of books donated and the scholar with the maximum donation.\n   c. Check if the current scholar is the maximum donor. If yes, break the loop.\n   d. Get the neighbors of the current scholar who are not visited yet.\n   e. For each neighbor, update the distance from Amir, the path taken, and the number of books donated.\n   f. Enqueue the neighbor and mark them as visited.\n5. Construct the shortest path by following the path taken from Amir to the maximum donor.\n6. Return the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Max"
