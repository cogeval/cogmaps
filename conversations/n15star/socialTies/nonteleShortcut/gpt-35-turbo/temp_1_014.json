Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here are the steps to determine the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue and add Amir to it as the starting point.\n   - Queue: Amir\n\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the previous scholar in the shortest path.\n\n5. Set the distance of Amir to 0 in the distance dictionary.\n\n6. While the queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:\n\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n      - Dequeue: Amir\n\n   b. Check if the scholar is the one who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim in this case). If yes, break the loop.\n      - Kim is donating the maximum number of books (50).\n\n   c. If the scholar has not been visited, mark it as visited and update the distance and previous scholar in the dictionaries for its connected scholars.\n\n   d. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar (except the visited ones) to the queue.\n\n7. Starting from Kim, follow the previous scholar in the shortest path until Amir is reached. Keep track of all the scholars in the path.\n\n8. Finally, list the scholars in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Kim"
