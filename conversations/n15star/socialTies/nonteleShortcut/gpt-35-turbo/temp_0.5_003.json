Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add him to the visited set.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated. Set it to 0 initially.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the person donating the maximum number of books. Set it to None initially.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the person donating them.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar, if they have not been visited before, and add them to the visited set.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the queue is empty.\n7. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's go through the process:\n\n1. Queue: [Amir]\n2. Visited: {Amir}\n3. Maximum number of books donated: 0\n4. Person donating the maximum number of books: None\n\n- Dequeue Amir from the queue.\n- Check if Amir is donating more books than the current maximum (0).

Maximum number of books donated: 0\n4. Person donating the maximum number of books: None\n\n- Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n- Check if Reza is donating more books than the current maximum (0). No, so no update.\n- Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n- Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n1. Queue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n2. Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n3. Maximum number of books donated: 0\n4. Person donating the maximum number of books: None\n\n- Dequeue Moin from the queue.\n- Check if Moin is donating more books than the current maximum (0).

Person donating the maximum number of books: None\n\n- Dequeue Pam from the queue.\n- Check if Pam is donating more books than the current maximum (0).
