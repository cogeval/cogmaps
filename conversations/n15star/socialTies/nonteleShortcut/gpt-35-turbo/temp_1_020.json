Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. Enqueue a variable to keep track of the current number of books.\n5. Set the current number of books to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   6.1 Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   6.2 If the scholar has not been visited before:\n       6.2.1 Add the scholar to the visited set.\n       6.2.2 If the scholar is donating books:\n           6.2.2.1 If the number of books donated by the scholar is greater than the current number of books, update the current number of books.\n           6.2.2.2 Remember the scholar as the potential destination.\n       6.2.3 Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited before.\n7.
