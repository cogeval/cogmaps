Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n\n2. Pop the first person from the queue (Amir).\n   Queue: []\n\n3. Check if Amir is donating the maximum number of books (50 books). Since Amir is not donating any books, we proceed to his connections.\n\n4. Add Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja) to the queue.\n   Queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n\n5.
