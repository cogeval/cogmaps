Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We know that Kim is donating 50 books, and Max is donating 10 books. We need to find the shortest path from Amir to either Kim or Max.\n\nLet's start with Amir. From Amir, we can directly reach Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Among these scholars, Pari is not connected to anyone else, so we can exclude Pari from our path.\n\nNow, let's continue from Pari. Pari is not connected to anyone else, so we cannot proceed further from Pari.\n\nNext, let's go back to Amir and explore another branch. From Amir, we can reach Reza, Moin, and Puja. Among these scholars, Reza is connected to Moin, and Moin is connected to Pari. Since we have already explored the path from Amir to Pari, we can exclude Reza and Moin from our path.\n\nNow, let's continue from Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Kim. Since Kim is the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, we can conclude that the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
