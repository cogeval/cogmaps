Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will then prioritize exploring scholars who are connected to the current scholar and have not been visited yet.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars and initialize it with Amir.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar and initialize it with the known donations (Kim - 50 books, Max - 10 books).\n4. Initialize a variable `max_books` to track the maximum number of books donated and a variable `max_books_scholar` to track the scholar donating the maximum number of books. Set `max_books` to 0 initially.\n5. Start a loop while the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark them as visited.\n    b. Check if the current scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If yes, update `max_books` and `max_books_scholar`.\n    c. Get the connections of the current scholar.\n    d. For each connected scholar that has not been visited yet, enqueue them, update their number of books donated by adding the current scholar's donation, and mark them as visited.\n6. Return the path from Amir to `max_books_scholar` as the shortest path.\n\nNow, let's go through the process and find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
