Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is donating books. If so, add them to a queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the removed scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If so, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. If not, check if the removed scholar is connected to any other scholar who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar who is donating books is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir:\n\n1.
