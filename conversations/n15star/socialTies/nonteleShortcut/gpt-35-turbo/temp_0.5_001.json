Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (Kim in this case). If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar (if they are not already visited) and mark them as visited.\n4. If the search completes without finding the person donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found.\"\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Kim:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Kim"
