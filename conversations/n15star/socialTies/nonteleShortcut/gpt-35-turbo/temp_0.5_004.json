We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of the scholars already visited.\n3. Initialize a path dictionary to store the path taken from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n5. Add Amir to the visited set.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books, stop the search and retrieve the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the scholar into the queue.\n       - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n       - Update the path dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the path from Amir to the current scholar as the value.\n7. If no scholar is found who is donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found.\"\n\nUsing the given information, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue, visited set, and path dictionary.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. Dequeue Amir from the queue.\n4. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n5. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja into the queue.\n6. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the visited set.\n7. Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n8. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n9. Enqueue Moin and Pari into the queue.\n10. Add Moin and Pari to the visited set.\n11. Dequeue Moin from the queue.\n12. Moin is connected to Pari.\n13. Enqueue Pari into the queue.\n14. Add Pari to the visited set.\n15. Dequeue Pari from the queue.\n16. Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n17. Dequeue Puja from the queue.\n18. Puja is connected to Pam.\n19. Enqueue Pam into the queue.\n20. Add Pam to the visited set.\n21. Dequeue Pam from the queue.\n22. Pam is connected to Kim.\n23. Enqueue Kim into the queue.\n24. Add Kim to the visited set.\n25. Dequeue Kim from the queue.\n26. Kim is connected to Pam.\n27. Kim is also connected to Wei and Puja, but they have already been visited.\n28. Kim is donating the maximum number of books, which is 50.\n29. Retrieve the path from Amir to Kim from the path dictionary.\n30. The shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books (Kim) is: \"Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim\".\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
