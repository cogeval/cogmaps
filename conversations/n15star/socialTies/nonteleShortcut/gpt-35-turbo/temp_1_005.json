Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize an empty queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n4. Create a variable named \"current_scholar\" and set it to Amir.\n5. Create a variable named \"max_books\" and set it to 0.\n6. Create a variable named \"path\" and set it to Amir.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue and assign it to \"current_scholar\".\n   b. If \"current_scholar\" has not been visited:\n      i.

If the number of books donated by \"current_scholar\" is greater than \"max_books\":\n          - Update \"max_books\" to the number of books donated by \"current_scholar\".\n          - Update \"path\" to the current path including \"current_scholar\".\n      iii.
