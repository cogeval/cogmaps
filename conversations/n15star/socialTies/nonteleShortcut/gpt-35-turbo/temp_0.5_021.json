Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n5. If the queue is empty and we haven't found the person who is donating the maximum number of books, it means there is no path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check if any of them are donating books.\n   - Reza is not donating books.\n   - Moin is not donating books.\n   - Pari is not donating books.\n   - Puja is donating books.\n4.
