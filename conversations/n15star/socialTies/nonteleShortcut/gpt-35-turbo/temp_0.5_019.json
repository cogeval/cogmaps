Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each person in the queue until the queue is empty.\n5. Keep track of the number of books donated by each person.\n6.

Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them is donating books, so we add them to the queue.\n3. Queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari. Pari is not donating books, so we continue to the next person in the queue.\n5. Moin is connected to Pari.
