Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar, with Amir's distance set to 0.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar, with Amir's donation set to 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar, do the following:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited, enqueue the scholar, mark them as visited, and update their distance and donation values.\n6. Find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n7. Trace back the path from this scholar to Amir using the distance dictionary.\n8. Return the names of the scholars in the path, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"
