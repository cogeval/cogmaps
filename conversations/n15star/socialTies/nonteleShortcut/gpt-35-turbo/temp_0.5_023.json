Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to Amir, then explore each scholar connected to those scholars, and so on, until we reach the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max). If yes, the shortest path is just Amir.\n3. If Amir is not directly connected to any scholar donating the maximum number of books, we need to explore the connections further.\n4. From Amir, explore each scholar connected to Amir (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja).\n5. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. If yes, the shortest path is Amir followed by that scholar.\n6. If none of the scholars connected to Amir are donating the maximum number of books, we need to explore further.\n7. From the scholars connected to Amir, explore each of their connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja).\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until we find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n9. Once we find the scholar donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max), list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
