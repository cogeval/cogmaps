Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start from Amir.\n2. Check if any of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books (in this case, 10 books). If yes, return the path with only Amir and the person donating the maximum number of books.\n3. If none of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books, expand the search to the next level of connections.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the person donating the maximum number of books is found.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start from Amir.\nAnswer: Amir\n\nStep 2: Check if any of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books (10 books).
