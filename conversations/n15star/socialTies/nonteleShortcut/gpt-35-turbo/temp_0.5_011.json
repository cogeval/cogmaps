Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Create an empty string to store the final path.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar has donated books. If yes, update the maximum number of books donated and the scholar's name.\n   - Iterate through all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n       - Update the shortest path dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the dequeued scholar as the value.\n       - Update the number of books donated dictionary with the connected scholar as the key and the number of books donated by the dequeued scholar as the value.\n7.
