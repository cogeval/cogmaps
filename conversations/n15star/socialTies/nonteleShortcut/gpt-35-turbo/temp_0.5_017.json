Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Initialize an empty visited set.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has been visited. If yes, continue to the next iteration.\n   c. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   d. Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n      - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar who is donating the maximum.\n   e. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar (if they have not been visited).\n6. Repeat steps 5 until the queue is empty.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
