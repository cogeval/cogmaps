Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections one level at a time until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a queue to keep track of the scholars to visit.\n2. Enqueue Amir as the starting point.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the connections between scholars and their neighbors.\n5. Add Amir to the visited set.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books (Max).\n   c. If yes, stop the search and output the visited scholars in the order they were visited.\n   d. If no, enqueue all the neighbors of the dequeued scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   e. Add the dequeued scholar to the visited set.\n   f. Update the connections dictionary with the dequeued scholar's neighbors.\n\nBy following this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
