Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar in the group. We will keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar and the shortest path to reach them.\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\n3. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n\n4. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, the shortest path is found. Return the path.\n\n5. If the dequeued scholar is not donating the maximum number of books, enqueue their connected scholars (who are not already visited) and update their number of books donated.\n\n   - If the connected scholar is already visited, ignore it.\n   - If the connected scholar is not visited, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and update the number of books donated.\n\n6. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, there is no path from Amir to such a scholar.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin"
