Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n5. Check Pari's connections: No further connections.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n7. Check Pam's connections: No further connections.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all possible connections from Amir. Now, let's check the connections of Wim, Raj, and Jing to see if any of them are connected to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\n8. Check Wim's connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n9. Check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n10. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n11. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n12. Check Pam's connections: No further connections.\n\nNo connection from Wim leads to the person donating the maximum number of books. Let's move on to Raj.\n\n13. Check Raj's connections: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n14. Check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n15. Check Ian's connections: Sara and Max.\n16. Check Sara's connections: Max.\n17. Check Max's connections: No further connections.\n\nWe have found a connection from Raj to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max). Now, let's check Jing's connections.\n\n18. Check Jing's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n19. Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n20. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n21. Check Pari's connections: No further connections.\n22. Check Max's connections: No further connections.\n\nAgain, we have found a connection from Jing to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max). \n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max) is: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
