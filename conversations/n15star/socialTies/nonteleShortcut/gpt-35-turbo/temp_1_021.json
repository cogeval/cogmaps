We start with Amir and explore all the scholars connected to Amir. Then, we explore the scholars connected to those scholars and so on until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStarting from Amir, the scholars connected to Amir are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. We continue the search by exploring the scholars connected to these scholars.\n\nFrom Reza, the scholars connected to Reza are Moin and Pari. Moin is not donating the maximum number of books, and Pari is also not donating the maximum number of books.\n\nFrom Moin, the only scholar connected to Moin is Pari. Pari is also not donating the maximum number of books.\n\nFrom Pari, there are no scholars connected to Pari.\n\nFrom Puja, the scholars connected to Puja are Pam and Kim. Kim is donating the maximum number of books. Hence, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
