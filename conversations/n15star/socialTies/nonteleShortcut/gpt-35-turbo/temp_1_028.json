Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start from Amir and initialize a queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Create an empty visited set and add Amir to it.\n4.

Create an empty book count dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n6. Initialize the book count of Amir to 0.\n7. Start the BFS loop:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - For each connected scholar not in the visited set:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Update the path dictionary with the shortest path from the connected scholar to Amir.\n     - Update the book count dictionary with the number of books donated by the connected scholar.\n8.
