Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar to the previous scholar in the shortest path.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. Set the initial maximum number of books donated to 0.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. For each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n      - If the connected scholar is not visited, enqueue them, mark them as visited, set their previous scholar in the shortest path to the current scholar, and add the number of books donated by the current scholar to them.\n      - If the connected scholar is already visited and the number of books donated by the current scholar plus the number of books donated by the connected scholar is greater than the maximum number of books donated, update the maximum number of books donated and set the previous scholar in the shortest path to the current scholar.\n8. Starting from the scholar with the maximum number of books donated, traverse the shortest path back to Amir using the dictionary of previous scholars in the shortest path.\n9. Return the list of scholar names in order from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the answer."
