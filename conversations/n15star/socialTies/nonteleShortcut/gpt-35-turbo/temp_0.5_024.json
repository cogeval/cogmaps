Since none of the connected scholars are donating any books, we need to explore further.\n5. Move to the next level of connected scholars: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Check the scholars connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja:\n   - Reza: Moin, Pari\n   - Moin: Pari\n   - Pari: No connections\n   - Puja: No connections\n7.
