Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Thanks a lot.\n@Ketwol: Oh yes, I forgot about that :) I'm sorry. I'll add it to the task. Can't make any changes now.\n@brianbraun: If the answer we provide is not the shortest one; will we lose?\n@Ketwol: Can we ignore the 'Amir's name' part of the task?\n@brianbraun No, It needs to be provided because you have to identify the shortest path from Amir to Max to find max.\nWell, there is an issue with the first input of the input string: it starts with a whitespace. Any input with the whitespace at the beginning is just ignored, which can easily be detected with \"if input.trim().length>\"\nThe first input of the regex I use is \"Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)\\S+\", where first part will check that input is a valid answer and the second part allows any white space after the answer.\nI am not sure why your input is rejected :(\nKetwol: Sorry if I was unclear. Let me clear it up: 1. I want to ignore the extra whitespace in the beginning. 2. You have to provide the shortest path.\nAnswers like Ian, Sara, and Max is not valid answer, as Sara has not been added into the graph. Please try to find a shortest path from Amir to Max.\nI am thinking about creating a parser that checks for the answer (Answer:...), but I can't find a reliable way to do so. It would be better to avoid the parser, if I can.\n@brianbraun: \"Amir connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja\" is valid answer, but \"Amir connected to .... , Moin, and Pari\" is not a correct answer for this part of the task description: \"Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir"
