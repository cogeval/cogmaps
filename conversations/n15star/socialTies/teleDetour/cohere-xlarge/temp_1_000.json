That's the problem with this level.\n\nThe first idea that comes to mind is to iterate over all the people and compare the number of books they donate. This idea will not work because there are several loops and a large number of comparisons that will result in a timeout.\n\nWe can use a dfs (Depth First Search) to find the number of books donated by a person. The code for the same is as follows:\n\nWe first initialize a queue that will store the path we have traversed. Then we traverse all the people. We push the name of the person to the queue. The deque will ensure that we don't have duplicate names in the path. Once we reach the end, we return the last element in the deque which is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nWe can use a dfs (Depth First Search) to find the number of books donated by a person.
