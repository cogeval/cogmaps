Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n7. Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n8. Soheil, Alice\n9. Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n10. Shanshan, Vadim\n11. Gongxue, Alice\n12. Ajit, Anisha\n\nSince there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue, we can start from Vivian's connections:\n\n1. Vivian -> Salma\n2. Vivian -> Shanshan\n3. Vivian -> Vadim\n\nFrom Salma, we have connections to:\n\n1. Shanshan\n2. Vadim\n3. Noah\n4. Anisha\n\nFrom Shanshan, we have connections to:\n\n1. Salma\n2. Vadim\n3. Noah\n4. Anisha\n\nFrom Vadim, we have connections to:\n\n1. Salma\n2. Shanshan\n3. Noah\n4. Anisha\n\nSince we can only connect to each person once, let's find the connection path that yields the most reward. We can start with Vivian and connect to Salma, Shanshan, or Vadim.\n\n1. Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Anisha\n2. Vivian -> Shanshan -> Salma -> Vadim -> Anisha\n3. Vivian -> Vadim -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Anisha\n\nAll three paths have the same number of connections. Therefore, any of these paths will yield the most reward. I will provide one of the paths as the final answer.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha"
