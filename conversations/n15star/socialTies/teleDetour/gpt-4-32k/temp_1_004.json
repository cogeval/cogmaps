Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

So, Kim is the person who is donating the most books.\n\nNext, we look at the connections and find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nFrom the information given:\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n- Puja is connected to Wim and Wei.\n- Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nGiven the above connections, the shortest path from Amir to Kim seems to be through Puja, Wim, and then to Kim. \n\nTherefore, the order of scholars starting from Amir to Kim is Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim."

According to the new information, Jing can immediately connect us to any other scholar, so we have to go through Jing to reach Kim.\n\nLooking at the connections:\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari.\n- Amir can reach Jing through either Reza or Moin (since both are directly connected to Jing).\n\nGiven this, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is to go through Jing.
