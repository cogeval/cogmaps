Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

However, none of these scholars is connected to Kim, who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nLet's take a deeper look into the network of scholars:\n\n1. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Neither of these connections lead to Kim. \n2. Moin is only connected to Pari, which also doesn't lead to Kim.\n3. Pari doesn't have any additional connections mentioned and doesn't connect to Kim either.\n4. Puja is connected to Pam. \n\nLooking further into Pam's connections, we find that Pam is connected to Kim. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, the person donating the most books, goes through Puja and Pam. \n\nAs a result, the scholar names in order starting from Amir are Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
