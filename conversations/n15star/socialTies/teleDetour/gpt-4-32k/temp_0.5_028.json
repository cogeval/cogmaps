Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nStep 4: Check each connection to find the shortest path to Kim. \n\n- Amir to Reza: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but not Kim. This path does not lead to Kim. \n- Amir to Moin: Moin is connected to Pari, but not Kim. This path does not lead to Kim. \n- Amir to Pari: Pari is not connected to Kim. This path does not lead to Kim. \n- Amir to Puja: Puja is connected to Pam and Kim. This path leads to Kim. \n\nStep 5: The shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja. \n\nFinal Outcome: The shortest path from Amir to Kim, who is donating the maximum number of books, is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

This path does not lead to Kim. \n\nStep 5: Since none of Amir's direct connections lead to Kim, Amir needs to connect with Jing. Jing can connect Amir to any scholar, including Kim. \n\nFinal Outcome: The shortest path from Amir to Kim, who is donating the maximum number of books, is Amir, Jing, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Kim."
