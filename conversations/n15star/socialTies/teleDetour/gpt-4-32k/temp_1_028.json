Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n7. Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n8. Soheil, Alice\n9. Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n10. Shanshan, Vadim\n11. Gongxue, Alice\n12. Ajit, Anisha\n\nI am connected with Vivian, and I cannot connect with Gongxue. Since Vivian is in Group 1, I will start there:\n\n1. Connect with Vivian.\n2. From Vivian, I can connect to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim (skipping Gongxue).\n3. From Salma, I can connect to Noah (Group 4) and Shanshan (Group 7).\n4. From Shanshan, I can connect to Noah (Group 4) and Vadim (Group 10).\n5. From Vadim, I can connect to Noah (Group 4) and Shanshan (Group 10).\n\nFrom the connections made so far, it seems that connecting to Noah (Group 4) would yield the most reward. Therefore, the most rewarding connection path would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Noah"
