Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

So, Kim is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nNow, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. Looking at the connections, we see that Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Neither of these scholars are directly connected to Kim, so we need to move to the next step. \n\nThe scholars directly connected to Amir have the following connections:\n\n1. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n2. Moin is connected to Pari.\n3. Pari does not have any additional connections. \n4. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nNow, let's look at the connections of Pam, who is connected to Puja and Kim. Puja is a direct connection from Amir, so Amir can reach Kim by going through Puja and Pam.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"

Since none of these scholars have a direct connection to Kim, the fastest way to reach Kim now would be through Jing, who can connect to any scholar instantly, including Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, considering the new situation, is: Amir -> Jing -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Kim"
