Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, it is Kim who is donating 50 books, which is more than Max who is donating 10 books.\n\nStep 2: Find the connections of Amir, who is the starting point. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Identify if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Kim. This is not the case, so we need to check the secondary connections of Amir's contacts.\n\nStep 4: Check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari. Pari has no additional connections. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nStep 5: None of the secondary connections of Amir are connected to Kim, so we need to check the tertiary connections. Pam is connected to Kim.\n\nStep 6: So the shortest path to reach Kim, starting from Amir, is: Amir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
