Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the information provided, Kim is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 2: Trace Amir's direct connections. According to the data, Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Check if any of Amir's direct connections link to Kim. None of Amir's direct connections are connected to Kim.\n\nStep 4: Go a level further and see the connections of Amir's direct connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja). Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, Moin is connected to Pari, and Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nStep 5: Since none of Amir's secondary connections lead to Kim, look at the third-level connections. From the provided data, we can see that Puja (Amir's direct connection) is connected to Pam, who is in turn connected to Kim.\n\nStep 6: Compile the shortest path from Amir to Kim following the connections.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"

None of Amir's direct connections are connected to Kim.\n\nStep 4: Review the new information that Jing has an instant connection portal and can immediately connect with any other scholar.
