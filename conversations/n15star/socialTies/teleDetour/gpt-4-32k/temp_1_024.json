Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We need to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books. The maximum number of books is being donated by Kim. Thus, we are to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nStep 1: Starting with Amir. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 2: Check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n       Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n       Moin is connected to Pari. \n       Puja is connected to Pam.\n       Pam is connected to Kim (who we are searching for).\n\nStep 3: From the above connections, we can see that the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir - Puja - Pam - Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, Kim, is Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari.\n\nStep 2: Check the connections of Reza, Moin, and Pari. \n         Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n         Moin is connected to Pari.\n         None of these connections lead to Kim. \n\nStep 3: Find the connection to Jing. Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. So, the shortest path from Amir to Jing is through Reza.\n\nStep 4: Using Jing's instant connection portal, we can directly connect to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, is Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim"
