Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Thus, Kim is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nSecond, I have to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nFrom the given information, Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nChecking each connection:\n- Reza is not directly connected to Kim.\n- Moin is not directly connected to Kim.\n- Pari is not directly connected to Kim.\n- Puja is directly connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is via Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

However, since Amir and Puja are no longer connected, we can't use the previous path (Amir-Puja-Kim). \n\nNow, considering the connections that Amir still has (Reza, Moin, Pari), and knowing that Jing can immediately connect us to any scholar, we need to reach Jing first. \n\nFrom the connections, I see that Reza is connected to Jing. So, we can reach Jing through Reza.\n\nAfter reaching Jing, we can immediately use his instant connection portal to get connected with Kim. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is now: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim"
