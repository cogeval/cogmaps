Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Next, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. However, none of them are directly connected to Kim. \n\nPuja, one of Amir's connections, is connected to Wim, who is directly connected to Kim. So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be through Puja and Wim.\n\nSo, the list of scholars in order from Amir to Kim would be Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim"
