Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the given connections, none of these scholars are directly connected to Kim, the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\n4. We must find a scholar who has direct connections to both Amir and Kim.\n\n5. Looking at the network, we can see that Puja is connected to Amir and has a direct link to Kim.\n\n6. Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja. \n\n7. Thus, the scholars' names in order are Amir, Puja, and Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

We can not use Puja anymore as a bridge to Kim due to their disagreement with Amir. \n\n5. However, Jing now has a portal that can connect us to any scholar. \n\n6. Amir does not have a direct connection to Jing, but he does have a connection to Reza, who has a connection to Jing. \n\n7. Thus, from Amir, we can reach Jing through Reza.\n\n8. Then, using Jing's portal, we can directly connect to Kim. \n\n9. Therefore, the scholars' names in order, starting from Amir, are Amir, Reza, Jing, and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim."
