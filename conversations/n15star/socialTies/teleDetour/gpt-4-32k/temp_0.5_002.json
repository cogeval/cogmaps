Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

In this case, it's Kim who is donating 50 books, which is more than Max who is donating 10 books. \n\nStarting from Amir, we need to trace the shortest path to Kim. According to the connections given, Amir is directly connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Kim. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

From Amir's connections, the shortest path to Jing is through Reza, as Reza is directly connected to Jing. Once connected with Jing, we can use his instant connection portal to immediately connect to Kim. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, considering the new circumstances, is Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim."
