Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Gongxue, Alice\n12. Ajit, Anisha\n\nNow, I am connected with Vivian and need to find a connection path that yields the most reward. Since there's no connection between Vivian and Gongxue, we will look for paths without Gongxue.\n\nThe first connection (1) is not an option due to the presence of Gongxue.\nThe other connections that include Vivian are:\n- Salma, Shanshan, Vadim (7) from connection 1\n- Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha (4)\n\nBased on the given information, the connection path with the most rewards would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha"
