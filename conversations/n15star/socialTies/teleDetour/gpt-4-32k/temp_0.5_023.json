Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

In this case, it's Kim who is donating 50 books.\nStep 2: Identify all the people who are directly connected to Amir. They are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\nStep 3: Check if Kim is in this list. If yes, then the shortest path is directly from Amir to Kim. If not, then we need to check the connections of the people in the list.\nStep 4: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, Moin is connected to Pari, Pari has no further connections, and Puja is connected to Pam.\nStep 5: Check if Kim is in this list. If yes, then the shortest path is Amir to one of these people, then to Kim. If not, then we need to check the connections of the people in this new list.\nStep 6: Moin is connected to Pari, Pari has no further connections, Pam is connected to Kim.\nStep 7: Now we have found Kim in the list. So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."
