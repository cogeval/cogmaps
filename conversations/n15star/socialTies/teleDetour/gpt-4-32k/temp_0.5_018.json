Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."
