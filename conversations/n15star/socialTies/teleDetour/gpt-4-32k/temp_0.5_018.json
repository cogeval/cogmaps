Therefore, Kim is the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. Based on the connections given:\n\nAmir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nWim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nRaj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nJing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n\nWei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nNisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nReza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n\nKim is connected to Pam.\n\nIan is connected to Sara, and Max.\n\nMoin is connected to Pari.\n\nPuja is connected to Pam.\n\nSara is connected to Max.\n\nFrom this information, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja. So the final path would be Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."
