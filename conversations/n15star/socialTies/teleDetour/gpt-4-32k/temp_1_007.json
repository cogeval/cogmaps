Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are all connected to each other. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

However, it's mentioned that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue. So Vivian's connections are: Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n\nStep 2: Find the connections of Vivian's connections.\nSalma is connected to Shanshan, Vadim, Noah, and Anisha.\nShanshan is connected to Vadim, Noah, Salma, and Anisha.\nVadim is connected to Shanshan, Salma, Noah, and Anisha.\n\nStep 3: Compare the new connections, and choose the one with the most unique connections.\nAll three of Vivian's connections (Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim) share the same connections, so there is no advantage in selecting one over the others.\n\nStep 4: Since all connections share the same connections, choose one and list the path.\nWe can choose any of Salma, Shanshan, or Vadim, and the path would be the same. For example, if we choose Salma, the path would be Vivian, Salma, Noah, Anisha (or any other order of the connections Salma has, since all of Vivian's connections have the same connections).\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Noah, Anisha"
