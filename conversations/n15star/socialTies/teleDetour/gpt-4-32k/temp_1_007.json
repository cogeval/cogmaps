Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "Let's visualize the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify who is donating the maximum number of books. Between Kim and Max, Kim is donating the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nStep 2: Identify the connections of Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Identify the shortest path from Amir to Kim. From the connections given, Amir is not directly connected to Kim but Puja is. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would involve Puja. So the path is: Amir - Puja - Kim.\n\nFinally, present the path: \"Amir, Puja, Kim\".\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

As before, Kim is donating the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nStep 2: Identify the connections of Amir. Now, Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari, but not Puja.\n\nStep 3: Utilize Jing's instant connection portal. As Amir is not directly connected to Jing either, we need to find a connection to Jing first. Out of Reza, Moin, and Pari, Reza is connected to Jing.\n\nStep 4: Connect to Kim through Jing's portal. Once connected with Jing, we can immediately connect to Kim. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim now is: Amir - Reza - Jing - Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Kim"
