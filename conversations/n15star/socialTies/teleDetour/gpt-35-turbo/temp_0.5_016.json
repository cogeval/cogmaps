Start with Amir.\n2. Check if any of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books (in this case, 10 books). None of Amir's immediate connections are donating 10 books.\n3. Expand the search to Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Reza, Moin, Pari, or Puja are donating 10 books. None of them are donating 10 books.\n5. Expand the search to the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Check if any of their connections are donating 10 books. None of them are donating 10 books.\n7. Continue expanding the search, checking the connections of all the scholars in the group until we find the person who is donating 10 books.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating 10 books is:\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Max\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Max"

Since Amir is not donating any books, we need to find an alternative path.\n3. Connect with Jing through the instant connection portal.\n4. From Jing, we can connect with any scholar. Let's connect with Reza.\n5. Check if Reza is donating the maximum number of books (10 books). Reza is not donating 10 books.\n6. Connect with Moin through Jing.\n7. Check if Moin is donating the maximum number of books (10 books). Moin is not donating 10 books.\n8. Connect with Pari through Jing.\n9. Check if Pari is donating the maximum number of books (10 books). Pari is not donating 10 books.\n10. Connect with Max through Jing.\n11. Check if Max is donating the maximum number of books (10 books). Max is donating 10 books.\n12. Since Max is donating the maximum number of books, we have found the person we were looking for.\n\nBased on the given connections and the use of the instant connection portal, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating 10 books is:\n\nAmir, Jing, Max\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Max"
