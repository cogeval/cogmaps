Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting with Amir, we look at his connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Among Amir's connections, we check if any of them are donating the maximum number of books. None of them are.\n3. We move on to Amir's connections' connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Among Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, we check if any of them are donating the maximum number of books. None of them are.\n5. We continue this process for each subsequent level until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n6. We keep track of the shortest path as we go along.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Starting with Amir, we know that he is not donating any books.\n2. We can use Jing's instant connection portal to connect with any scholar. Let's connect with Jing first.\n3. From Jing, we have instant access to all the scholars he is connected to: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n4. Among Jing's connections, we check if any of them are donating the maximum number of books. Max is donating 10 books, which is the maximum.\n5. We have found the person who is donating the maximum number of books. Now, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Max.\n6. The shortest path from Amir to Max, considering the connections we know, is: Amir, Jing, Max.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Max."
