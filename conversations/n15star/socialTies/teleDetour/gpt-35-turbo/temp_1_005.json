Here are the steps I will take:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars, considering that Amir and Puja are no longer connected.\n2. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) and add a tuple (0, Amir) to it, where the first element represents the distance and the second element represents the scholar.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from Amir to each scholar and set the distance of Amir to 0 and the distance of all other scholars to infinity.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the previous scholar in the shortest path to each scholar and set the previous scholar of all scholars to None.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   6. Dequeue a scholar from the priority queue.\n   7. If the scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books, stop the algorithm and backtrack to find the shortest path.\n   8. For each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n      9. Calculate the tentative distance to the connected scholar as the sum of the distance to the current scholar and the number of books the connected scholar is donating.\n      10. If the tentative distance is shorter than the current shortest distance to the connected scholar:\n          11. Update the shortest distance to the connected scholar.\n          12. Update the previous scholar in the shortest path to the connected scholar.\n          13. Enqueue a tuple (tentative distance, connected scholar) to the priority queue.\n14.
