Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar is donating. Set the initial value for Kim as 50 and Max as 10.\n5.

While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the shortest path.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar into the queue.\n   - Update the number of books and the shortest path for the connected scholars.\n7.
