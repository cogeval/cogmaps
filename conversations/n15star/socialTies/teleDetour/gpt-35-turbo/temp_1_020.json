Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each person in the queue until the queue is empty or we find someone donating the maximum number of books.\n5. If the queue becomes empty without finding someone donating the maximum number of books, stop and return \"No path found\".\n6.
