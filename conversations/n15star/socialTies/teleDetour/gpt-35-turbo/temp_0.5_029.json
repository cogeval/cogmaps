Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will start by exploring the connections of Amir and keep track of the number of books each person is donating.\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize a queue with Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n4. Dequeue a person from the front of the queue.\n5. If the person is donating the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path.\n6. If the person has not been visited before, add them to the visited set and enqueue their connections.\n7. Update the number of books donated by the current person based on the number of books they received from their connections.\n8.
