Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to Amir and keep track of the number of books they are donating. We will continue this process until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar. Set the initial value for Amir as 0.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar. Set the initial value for Amir as an empty list.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the shortest path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar, do the following:\n      i. If the scholar is not already in the dictionary of visited scholars, add the scholar to the dictionary and enqueue the scholar.\n      ii. Update the number of books donated by the current scholar's connected scholar by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n      iii. Update the shortest path from Amir to the current scholar's connected scholar by appending the current scholar to the shortest path from Amir to the current scholar.\n6. If no scholar is found who is donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow, let's execute the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
