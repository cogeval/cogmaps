Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the desired path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars and their connections.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty list to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books donated and the corresponding scholar.\n5. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has not been visited before:\n      - Add the scholar to the visited list.\n      - Check if the scholar is donating books and if the number of books is greater than the current maximum.\n      - Update the maximum number of books and the corresponding scholar if necessary.\n      - Enqueue the connected scholars to the queue.\n   c. Repeat steps a and b until all scholars are visited or the maximum number of books is found.\n6. Starting from Amir, construct the shortest path by backtracking from the scholar donating the maximum number of books to Amir.\n7. Return the path in the requested format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari"
