Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

If no, check if any of Amir's connections are connected to scholars who are donating books.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a scholar who is donating books is found.\n6.
