With the introduction of the instant connection portal through Jing, we can utilize it to explore different paths. \n\nStarting from Amir, let's explore the connections using the instant connection portal:\n1. Connect with Jing.\n2. From Jing, let's explore the connections:\n   - Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Since Max is donating the maximum number of books, we can prioritize exploring the connection to Max.\n3. Connect with Max.\n4. From Max, let's explore the connections:\n   - Max is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Since Kim is not donating the maximum number of books, we need to continue exploring other connections.\n   - Max is also connected to Ian and Sara.\n5. Connect with Ian.\n6. From Ian, let's explore the connections:\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Since we have already connected with Max, we need to continue exploring other connections.\n   - Ian is also connected to Sara.\n7. Connect with Sara.\n8. From Sara, let's explore the connections:\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n   - Since we have already connected with Max, we have reached the end of the path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\nAmir, Jing, Max, Ian, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Max, Ian, Sara."
