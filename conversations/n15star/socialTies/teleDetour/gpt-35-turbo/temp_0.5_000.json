Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir and add him to the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to the previous scholar.\n4. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books donated and initialize it to 0.\n5. Create a variable to store the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and initialize it to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum:\n       - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar who is donating them.\n     - If the scholar is not the one donating the maximum number of books, enqueue all their connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n     - For each connected scholar, update the path dictionary with the current scholar as the previous scholar.\n7.
