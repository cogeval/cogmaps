Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

To find the shortest path from Amir to Max, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is not connected to Max.\n5. Puja is not connected to Max.\n\nBased on this analysis, there is no direct path from Amir to Max. Therefore, there is no shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: No shortest path from Amir to Max."
