Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   c. If not, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any other scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue.\n4. Dequeue Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Add Moin and Pari to the queue.\n7. Dequeue Moin.\n8. Moin is connected to Pari.
