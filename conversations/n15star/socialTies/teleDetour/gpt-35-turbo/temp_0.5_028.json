Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Dequeue a scholar from the queue and check if they are donating books.\n5. If the scholar is donating books, store their name and the number of books.\n6. If not, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who are not in the visited set.\n7. Add the current scholar to the visited set.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue is empty.\n9.
