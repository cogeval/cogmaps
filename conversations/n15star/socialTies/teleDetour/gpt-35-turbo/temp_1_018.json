Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with Amir as the starting node.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to the previous scholar in the shortest path.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max), stop the search and construct the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - For each connected scholar to the current scholar that is not in the visited set, enqueue the connected scholar and update the path dictionary.\n5. Construct the shortest path by starting from the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and following the previous scholar in the path dictionary until reaching Amir.\n\nNow, let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with Amir: \"Amir\".\n2. Set the visited set as empty: {}.\n3. Set the path dictionary as empty: {}.\n4.
