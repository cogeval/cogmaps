Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar is donating. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar and set the distance of Amir as 0.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar is donating.\n5. Initialize variables to store the maximum number of books and the scholar who is donating them.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar who is donating them.\n   - Check if the scholar is connected to any other scholars who have not been visited. If so, enqueue those scholars, mark them as visited, update their distance, and update the number of books they are donating.\n7. Repeat step 6 until the queue is empty.\n8. Return the scholar names in order, starting from Amir and ending with the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given group:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
