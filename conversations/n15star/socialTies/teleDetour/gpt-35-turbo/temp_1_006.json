Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here's how we can proceed step by step:\n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to anyone who is donating books.\n3. If yes, add that person to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each person in the queue until you find the person donating the maximum number of books.\n5. Once you find the person donating the maximum number of books, stop the search.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating books.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. None of them are donating books.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari. None of them are donating books.\n4. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is not donating the maximum number of books.\n6. There are no more connections to explore from Amir.\n\nSince we couldn't find the person donating the maximum number of books starting from Amir, we need to explore other paths.\n\nLet's start from Wim:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is donating books.\n2. We have found the person donating the maximum number of books. Stop the search.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
