Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check the connections of Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of Reza: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n5. Check the connections of Pari: No more connections.\n6. Check the connections of Puja: Pam.\n7. Check the connections of Pam: No more connections.\n8. Since none of the connections of Amir are donating the maximum number of books, we need to explore the connections of each connection further.\n9. Check the connections of Reza: Moin and Pari.\n10. Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n11. Check the connections of Pari: No more connections.\n12. Since none of the connections of Reza are donating the maximum number of books, we need to explore the connections of each connection further.\n13. Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n14. Check the connections of Pari: No more connections.\n15. Since Pari is donating the maximum number of books (10), we can stop here.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Pari) is: Amir, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari"
