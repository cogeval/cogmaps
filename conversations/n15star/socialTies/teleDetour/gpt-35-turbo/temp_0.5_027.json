Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each person in the queue until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n5. Keep track of the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. None of them are donating books, so add their connections to the queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Process the next person in the queue: Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n6. None of them are donating books, so add their connections to the queue: Moin and Pari.\n7. Process the next person in the queue: Moin.\n8. Moin is connected to Pari.\n9. None of them are donating books, so add their connections to the queue: Pari.\n10. Process the next person in the queue: Pari.\n11. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n12. Pari is not donating books, so remove Pari from the queue.\n13. Process the next person in the queue: Puja.\n14. Puja is connected to Pam.\n15. Pam is donating 10 books, which is the maximum number of books.\n16. We have found the person donating the maximum number of books.\n17. The shortest path from Amir to Pam is: Amir, Puja, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
