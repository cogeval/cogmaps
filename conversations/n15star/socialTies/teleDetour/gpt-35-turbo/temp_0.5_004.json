Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim.\n7. Kim is connected to Wei and Puja.\n8. Wei is not connected to anyone else.\n\nSince Max is donating the maximum number of books and is connected to both Pari and Moin, we can take the shortest path through Moin to reach Max.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Max is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Max"
