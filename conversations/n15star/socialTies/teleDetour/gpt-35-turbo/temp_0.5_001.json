Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, add the scholar's name to the path list.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path list.\n   - If not, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who are not visited yet.\n   - Mark all the connected scholars as visited.\n5.
