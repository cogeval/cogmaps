Initialize a variable \"max_donation\" to keep track of the maximum number of books donated, initially set to 0.\n4. Initialize a variable \"max_donator\" to keep track of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, initially set to an empty string.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   6. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue and mark them as visited.\n   7. If the scholar is donating books, check if their donation is greater than the current maximum donation. If so, update the \"max_donation\" and \"max_donator\" variables accordingly.\n   8. Check all the connections of the current scholar:\n      9.
