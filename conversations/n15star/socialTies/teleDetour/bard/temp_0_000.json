Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Use Amir's connection to Pam to connect to Pam.\n3. Use Pam's connection to Kim to connect to Kim.\n4. Kim is the person who is donating the maximum number of books, so the path is complete.\n\nThe final path is Amir, Pam, Kim. This path is the shortest path from Amir to Kim because it takes the fewest number of steps.\n\nThe reason that this path is shorter than the previous path is because the previous path had to go through Reza, Moin, and Puja in order to reach Kim. However, with Amir's new connection to Pam, we can bypass Reza, Moin, and Puja and go directly to Kim.\n\nHere is the output in the required format:\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Pam, Kim\n```"
