Check if Pari is connected to Wim directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, Wim.\n3. If not, check Pari's connections: Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Pari's connections are connected to Wim. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, the connecting scholar, Wim.\n5. If not, move to the next level of connections: Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Wim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Pari to Wim is:\n\nPari, Amir, Puja, Wim\n\nAnswer: Pari, Amir, Puja, Wim"
