Check if Reza is connected to Nisha directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Nisha. Answer: Reza, Nisha.\n3. If Reza is not connected to Nisha directly, check if Reza is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, [scholar connected to Reza], Nisha. Answer: Reza, [scholar connected to Reza], Nisha.\n4. If Reza is not connected to Nisha directly or through any scholars who are directly connected to Nisha, repeat step 3 for all the scholars connected to Reza.\n5. Continue this process until Nisha is reached or all possible paths are explored.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm:\n\nStarting with Reza:\n- Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Neither Moin nor Pari is directly connected to Nisha.\n- Moin is connected to Pari. Pari is not directly connected to Nisha.\n- Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n\nNext, we move to the scholars connected to Moin:\n- Moin is connected to Pari. Pari is not directly connected to Nisha.\n- Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n\nSince we have explored all possible paths and haven't reached Nisha, it means there is no path from Reza to Nisha.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Reza to Nisha is not found."
