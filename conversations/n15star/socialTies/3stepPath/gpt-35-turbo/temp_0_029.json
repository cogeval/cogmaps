If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Ian.\n3. If not, check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of Wei's connections are connected to Ian. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the connected scholar, Ian.\n5. If not, check the connections of Wei's connections.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Ian.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Ian.\n   - Pam is not connected to Ian.\n6. Since none of Wei's connections or their connections are connected to Ian, we need to explore further.\n7. Check the connections of Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Ian.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Ian.\n   - Pam is not connected to Ian.\n8. Check the connections of Pam.\n   - Pam is not connected to Ian.\n9.
