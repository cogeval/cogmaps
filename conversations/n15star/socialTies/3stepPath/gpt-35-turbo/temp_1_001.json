Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections until we reach Kim.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Explore each connection in order:\n   - Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin's connection: Pari.\n   - Pari has no further connections.\n   - Puja's connection: Pam.\n4. Move to the next level and explore Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja's connections:\n   - Reza's connection: Moin.\n   - Moin has no further connections.\n   - Pari has no further connections.\n   - Puja's connection: Pam.\n5. Move to the next level and explore Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja's connections:\n   - Reza has no further connections.\n   - Moin has no further connections.\n   - Pari has no further connections.\n   - Puja's connection: Pam.\n6. Move to the next level and explore Pam's connections: Kim.\n7. Kim is our target scholar.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
