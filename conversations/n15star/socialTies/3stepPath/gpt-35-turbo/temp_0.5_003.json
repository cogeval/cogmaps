Check Pari's connections: Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Pam and Kim.\n7. Check Pam's connections: Kim.\n8. Check Kim's connections: Puja and Wei.\n9. Since Kim is directly connected to Wei, the shortest path from Reza to Wei is Reza, Pari, Puja, Kim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Pari, Puja, Kim, Wei"
