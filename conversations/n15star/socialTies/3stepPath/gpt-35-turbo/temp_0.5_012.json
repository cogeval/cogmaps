If yes, then the shortest path is Moin, Ian.\n3. If Moin is not directly connected to Ian, check Moin's connections (Reza and Pari).\n4. Check if any of Moin's connections are directly connected to Ian. If yes, then the shortest path is Moin, connection, Ian.\n5. If none of Moin's connections are directly connected to Ian, check the connections of Moin's connections (Reza and Pari).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Ian is found or all possible paths are exhausted.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Moin to Ian is:\n\nMoin, Reza, Pari, Ian\n\nAnswer: Moin, Reza, Pari, Ian"
