While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue. Let's call it current_scholar.\n   - Check if current_scholar is Wei. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to current_scholar (that have not been visited) and add them to the visited set.\n\nFollowing these steps, we will find the shortest path from Reza to Wei."
