Check Pari's connections: Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since Wei is not connected to Amir, we move on.\n4. Check Reza's connections: Moin, Pari. Since Wei is not connected to Reza, we move on.\n5. Check Moin's connections: Pari. Since Wei is not connected to Moin, we move on.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Pam, Kim, Wei. Since Wei is connected to Puja, we have found the shortest path.\n7. The shortest path from Pari to Wei is: Pari, Puja, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Puja, Wei."
