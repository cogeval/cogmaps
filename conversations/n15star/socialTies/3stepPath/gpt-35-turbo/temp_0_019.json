If yes, the shortest path is just Pari and Sara.\n3. If not, check Pari's connections: Amir, Reza, and Moin.\n4. Check if any of Pari's connections are connected to Sara. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, followed by the connection to Sara.\n5. If not, check the connections of Pari's connections: Amir's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza's connections are Moin and Pari. Moin's connections are Pari. \n6. Continue this process, checking the connections of each scholar until Sara is found.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Pari to Sara is:\n\nPari, Amir, Reza, Moin, Sara\n\nAnswer: Pari, Amir, Reza, Moin, Sara"
