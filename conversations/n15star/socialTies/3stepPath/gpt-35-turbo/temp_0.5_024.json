If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Sara.\n3. If not, check if Wim is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Sara. In this case, Wim is connected to Wei, who is directly connected to Kim, who is directly connected to Sara. So the shortest path is Wim, Wei, Kim, Sara.\n4.

In this case, Wim is connected to Puja, who is directly connected to Pam, who is directly connected to Kim, who is directly connected to Sara. So the shortest path is Wim, Puja, Pam, Kim, Sara.\n5.
