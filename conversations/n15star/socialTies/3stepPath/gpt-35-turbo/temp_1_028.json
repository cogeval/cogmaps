Start at Wei.\n2. Check if Wei is directly connected to Nisha. If yes, then the path is Wei, Nisha.\n3. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholar who is directly connected to Nisha. If yes, then the path is Wei, the intermediate scholar, Nisha.\n4. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholar who is connected to another scholar who is directly connected to Nisha. Repeat this process until we find a path to Nisha.\n5. If no path is found, there is no connection between Wei and Nisha in the given group.\n\nNow, let's follow the steps to find the shortest path from Wei to Nisha:\n\n1. Wei is directly connected to Kim. (Wei -> Kim)\n2. Kim is directly connected to Pam. (Wei -> Kim -> Pam)\n3. Pam is directly connected to Puja. (Wei -> Kim -> Pam -> Puja)\n4. Puja is directly connected to Nisha. (Wei -> Kim -> Pam -> Puja -> Nisha)\n\nAnswer: Wei, Kim, Pam, Puja, Nisha"
