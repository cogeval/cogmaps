Starting from Pari, we will explore each connected scholar one by one, keeping track of the distance from Pari. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from Pari.\n2. Pari is connected to Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin.\n4. Moin is connected to Pari, Reza, and Pari (already visited).\n5. Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim.\n7. Kim is connected to Puja (already visited), Pam (already visited), and Wei.\n8. Wei is connected to Puja (already visited).\n9. Puja is connected to Pam (already visited), Kim (already visited), and Wei (already visited).\n10. No more unvisited scholars connected to Pari.\n\nNow let's move on to the next step:\n\n11. Reza is connected to Moin (already visited).\n12. Moin is connected to Pari (already visited), Reza (already visited), and Pari (already visited).\n13. No more unvisited scholars connected to Reza.\n\nContinuing:\n\n14. Puja is connected to Pam (already visited).\n15. Pam is connected to Kim (already visited).\n16.
