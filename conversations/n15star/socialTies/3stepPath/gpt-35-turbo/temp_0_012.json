If yes, the shortest path is just Moin and Ian.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections: Reza and Pari.\n4. Check if Reza is connected to Ian. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Reza, and Ian.\n5. If not, check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n6. Check if Moin is connected to Ian. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this step.\n7. Check if Pari is connected to Ian. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, and Ian.\n8. If not, check Pari's connections: Moin.\n9. Check if Moin is connected to Ian. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this step.\n10.
