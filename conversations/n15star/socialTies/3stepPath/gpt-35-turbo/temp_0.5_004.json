Check if Reza is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Pam.\n3. If not, check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check if Moin or Pari is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Moin (or Pari), Pam.\n5. If not, check Moin's connections: Pari.\n6. Check if Pari is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Moin, Pari, Pam.\n7. If not, check Pari's connections: None.\n8. Since Pari has no other connections, backtrack to Reza's other connection: Moin.\n9. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n10. Check if Pari is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Moin, Pari, Pam.\n11. If not, check Pari's connections: None.\n12. Since Pari has no other connections, backtrack to Reza's other connection: None.\n13. Reza has no other connections to check, and we have not found a path to Pam yet.\n14. Repeat the same steps for the remaining scholars, starting with Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n15. Finally, we find that the shortest path from Reza to Pam is Reza, Moin, Pari, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Pari, Pam."
