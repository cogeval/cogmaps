Check the scholars connected to Pari (Amir, Reza, and Moin). Add them to a queue.\n3. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if they are Pam. If yes, then the shortest path is Pari, Amir, Pam. If not, add their connections (Reza, Moin, and Pari) to the queue.\n4. Take the next scholar from the queue (Reza) and repeat step 3.\n5. Continue this process until Pam is found or the queue is empty.\n6. If the queue becomes empty without finding Pam, then there is no path from Pari to Pam.\n\nApplying the algorithm, the shortest path from Pari to Pam is:\nAnswer: Pari, Amir, Puja, Pam"
