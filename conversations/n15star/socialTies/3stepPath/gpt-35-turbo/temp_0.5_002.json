Check if Reza is connected to Wim directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Wim. Answer: Reza, Wim.\n3. If Reza is not connected to Wim directly, check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check if Moin or Pari is connected to Wim directly. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Moin (or Pari), Wim. Answer: Reza, Moin (or Pari), Wim.\n5. If Moin and Pari are not connected to Wim directly, check their connections: Reza, Pari (or Moin), Pari (or Moin), Pari (or Moin).\n6. Continue this process until Wim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Reza to Wim is Reza, Pari, Puja, Wei, Wim. Answer: Reza, Pari, Puja, Wei, Wim."
