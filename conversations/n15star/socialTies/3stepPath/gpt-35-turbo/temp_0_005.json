Create an empty queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Nisha, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue all their connected scholars.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Reza to Nisha.\n\nNow let's apply the algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Reza.\n2. Enqueue Reza.\n3. Mark Reza as visited.\n4. Dequeue Reza.\n5. Enqueue Moin and Pari (Reza's connections).\n6. Mark Moin and Pari as visited.\n7. Dequeue Moin.\n8. Enqueue Pari (Moin's connection).\n9. Mark Pari as visited.\n10. Dequeue Pari.\n11. Enqueue Nisha (Pari's connection).\n12. Mark Nisha as visited.\n13. Dequeue Nisha.\n14. The algorithm stops as Nisha is the target scholar.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Pari, Nisha"
