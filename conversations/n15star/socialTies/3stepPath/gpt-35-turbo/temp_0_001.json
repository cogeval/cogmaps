If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Kim.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Kim. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection to Kim.\n5. If not, move to the next level of connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Check if any of the connections from the previous level are connected to Kim. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection from the previous level, and then Kim.\n7. If not, continue this process until Kim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is:\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Kim\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Kim"
