We will continue this process until we reach Moin.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Wim into the queue and add Wim to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue (let's call this scholar \"current\").\n   - If the current scholar is Moin, we have found the shortest path. Stop the process.\n   - Otherwise, check all the connections of the current scholar.\n   - For each connected scholar that has not been visited yet, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Update the distance from Wim to the connected scholar (this can be done by keeping track of the distance from Wim to the current scholar and incrementing it by 1).\n4. If the process reaches this point without finding Moin, it means that there is no path from Wim to Moin.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Wim to Moin is:\n\nWim, Puja, Moin\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Moin"
