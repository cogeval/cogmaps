Check Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Moin and Reza.\n3. Expand the search to Moin: Moin is connected to Pari, Reza, and Max.\n4. Expand the search to Reza: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n5. Expand the search to Max: Max is connected to Moin, Pari, and Nisha.\n6. Expand the search to Nisha: Nisha is connected to Max, Ian, and Sara.\n7. Expand the search to Ian: Ian is connected to Nisha, Sara, and Max.\n\nWe have found Ian, so the shortest path from Pari to Ian is: Pari, Moin, Max, Nisha, Ian.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Moin, Max, Nisha, Ian"
