Starting from Reza, we will traverse through each scholar's connections until we reach Wim. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars we need to visit.\n2. Add Reza to the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar to its predecessor.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Wim, stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through the connections of the dequeued scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n       - Add the connected scholar as a predecessor of the dequeued scholar in the path dictionary.\n6. If we reach this step, it means there is no path from Reza to Wim.\n7. If we found a path to Wim, we can reconstruct the shortest path by following the predecessors in the path dictionary from Wim to Reza.\n8. Return the shortest path from Reza to Wim.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Reza to Wim is: Reza, Pari, Puja, Wei, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Pari, Puja, Wei, Wim"
