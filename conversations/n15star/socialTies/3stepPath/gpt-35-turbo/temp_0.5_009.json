We will continue this process until we reach Wei.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Moin.\n2. Moin is connected to Pari and Reza. Add Pari and Reza to the queue.\n3. Explore Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Moin. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this connection.\n4. Explore Reza's connections: Reza is connected to Moin. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this connection.\n5. The queue now contains Pari and Reza.\n6. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Pari.\n7. Pari is connected to Moin. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this connection.\n8. The queue now contains Reza.\n9. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n10. Reza is connected to Moin. Since we have already visited Moin, we skip this connection.\n11. The queue is now empty.\n12. We have explored all possible connections from Moin, and Wei has not been found.\n13. Since we have not found Wei, there is no path from Moin to Wei.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Moin to Wei."
