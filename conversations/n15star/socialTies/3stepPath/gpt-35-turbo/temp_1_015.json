Check Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check Amir's connections: Amir is not connected to Wei.\n4. Check Reza's connections: Reza is not connected to Wei.\n5. Check Moin's connections: Moin is not connected to Wei.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Puja is connected to Wei.\n7. Since Puja is connected to Wei, we have found a path from Pari to Wei.\n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path from Pari to Wei is:\n\nAnswer: Pari, Puja, Wei"
