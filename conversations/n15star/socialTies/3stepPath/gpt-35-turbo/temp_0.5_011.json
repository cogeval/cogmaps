Check if Moin is connected to Nisha directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Moin and Nisha.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections (Reza and Pari).\n4. Check if any of Moin's connections are connected to Nisha directly. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, the connected scholar, and Nisha.\n5. If not, check the connections of Moin's connections (Reza, Pari, and Moin).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Nisha is found or all connections are exhausted.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from Moin to Nisha: Moin, Pari, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Nisha"
