If yes, the shortest path is just Pari and Nisha.\n3. If not, check Pari's connections: Amir, Reza, and Moin.\n4. Check if any of Pari's connections are connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, followed by the connection, and then Nisha.\n5. If not, check the connections of Pari's connections: Amir's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza's connections are Moin and Pari. Moin's connections are Pari. None of these connections are connected to Nisha.\n6. Continue this process, checking the connections of the connections, until Nisha is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Pari to Nisha is:\n\nPari, Amir, Puja, Nisha\n\nAnswer: Pari, Amir, Puja, Nisha"
