If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Nisha.\n3. If not, check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of Wei's connections are connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the connected scholar, Nisha.\n5. If not, check the connections of Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Nisha is found.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Wei to Nisha is:\n\nWei, Kim, Pam, Nisha\n\nAnswer: Wei, Kim, Pam, Nisha"
