If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Nisha.\n3. If Moin is not directly connected to Nisha, check Moin's connections (Pari and Reza).\n4. Add Pari and Reza to the search queue.\n5. Check if Pari or Reza is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari (or Reza), Nisha.\n6. If Pari and Reza are not directly connected to Nisha, check their connections (Reza and Pari for Pari, and Moin, Pari, and Max for Reza).\n7. Continue this process until Nisha is found or the search queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from Moin to Nisha:\n\nMoin, Pari, Reza, Nisha\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Reza, Nisha"
