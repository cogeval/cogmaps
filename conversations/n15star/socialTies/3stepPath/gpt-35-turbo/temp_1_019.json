Starting from Pari, we will explore the connections of each scholar.\n2. We will maintain a queue to store the scholars to be visited in the next iteration.\n3. We will also maintain a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n4. Initially, the queue will contain only Pari.\n5. We will iterate while the queue is not empty.\n6. In each iteration, we will remove the first scholar from the queue.\n7. If the removed scholar is Sara, we can stop the search and return the path.\n8. Otherwise, we will add all the unvisited connected scholars of the removed scholar to the queue.\n9. We will also update the visited set.\n10. We will repeat steps 6 to 9 until either Sara is found or the queue becomes empty.\n11. If the queue becomes empty and Sara is not found, it means there is no path from Pari to Sara.\n\nNow, I will implement these steps to find the shortest path from Pari to Sara."
