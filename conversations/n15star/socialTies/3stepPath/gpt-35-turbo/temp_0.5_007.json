Create an empty queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create an empty visited set and add Reza to it.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Reza to it.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued scholar is Sara, we have found the shortest path. Return the path list.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n      - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n      - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n      - Create a new path list by copying the current path list and adding the connected scholar to it.\n6. If the queue becomes empty and Sara is not found, there is no path from Reza to Sara.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Reza to Sara is:\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Pari, Sara"
