If yes, then the shortest path is Pari, Wim.\n3. If Pari is not directly connected to Wim, we need to explore its connections.\n4. From Pari, we can reach Moin and Reza.\n5. From Moin, we can reach Pari, Reza, and Pari is already visited so we skip it.\n6. From Reza, we can reach Moin and Pari, but Pari is already visited so we skip it.\n7. From Wim, we can reach Wei and Kim.\n8. From Wei, we can reach Wim, Kim, Puja, and Pam, but Wim is already visited so we skip it.\n9. From Kim, we can reach Wim and Pam, but Wim is already visited so we skip it.\n10. From Puja, we can reach Pam and Kim, but Pam is already visited so we skip it.\n11. From Pam, we can reach Kim and Puja, but Kim is already visited so we skip it.\n12. We have explored all possible connections and did not find Wim.\n13. Since we did not find a path from Pari to Wim, there is no shortest path.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Pari to Wim."
