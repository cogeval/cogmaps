Create an empty queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create an empty visited set and add Reza to it.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Reza to it.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Wei, return the path list.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the path list.\n6. If no path is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Reza to Wei is:\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wei"
