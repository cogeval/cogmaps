Check Pari's connections: Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since Ian is not connected to Amir, we move on.\n4. Check Reza's connections: Moin, Pari. Since Ian is not connected to Reza, we move on.\n5. Check Moin's connections: Pari. Since Ian is not connected to Moin, we move on.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Pam, Wim, Wei, Kim. Since Ian is not connected to Puja, we move on.\n7. Check Pam's connections: Kim. Since Ian is not connected to Pam, we move on.\n8. Check Wim's connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam. Since Ian is not connected to Wim, we move on.\n9. Check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, Pam. Since Ian is not connected to Wei, we move on.\n10. Check Kim's connections: Puja, Pam. Since Ian is connected to Kim, we have found the shortest path.\n11.
