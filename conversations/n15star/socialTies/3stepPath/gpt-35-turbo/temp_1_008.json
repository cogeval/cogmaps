Check if Moin is directly connected to Wim. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections: Reza, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Moin's connections are directly connected to Wim. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n5. If not, move to the next level of connections: Reza is connected to Moin, Pari, and Puja. Pari is connected to Moin, and Puja is connected to Moin and Pam.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until Wim is found or all connections have been explored.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wim"
