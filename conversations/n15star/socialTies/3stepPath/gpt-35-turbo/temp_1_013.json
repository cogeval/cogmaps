Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n     - If the node is Sara, we have found the shortest path.\n     - Otherwise, mark the node as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the connected nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet.\n5. If we reach this point, there is no path from Moin to Sara.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Moin.\n2. Enqueue Moin: Moin\n3. Visited set: {}\n4. Queue: Moin\n   - Dequeue Moin\n   - Moin is connected to Pari and Reza, enqueue them: Pari, Reza\n5. Visited set: {Moin}\n   - Queue: Pari, Reza\n   - Dequeue Pari\n   - Pari is connected to Moin, Reza, and Puja. Enqueue Reza and Puja: Reza, Puja\n6. Visited set: {Moin, Pari}\n   - Queue: Reza, Puja\n   - Dequeue Reza\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Both are already visited, so skip them.\n   - Enqueue Moin and Pari's other connections: Pari\n7. Visited set: {Moin, Pari, Reza}\n   - Queue: Puja, Pari\n   - Dequeue Puja\n   - Puja is connected to Moin, Wei, and Kim. Enqueue Moin, Wei, and Kim: Pari, Wei, Kim\n8. Visited set: {Moin, Pari, Reza, Puja}\n   - Queue: Pari, Wei, Kim\n   - Dequeue Pari\n   - Pari is already visited, skip.\n   - Enqueue Pari's other connections: \n9. Visited set: {Moin, Pari, Reza, Puja}\n   - Queue: Wei, Kim\n   - Dequeue Wei\n   - Wei is connected to Kim and Puja. Both are already visited, skip.\n   - Enqueue Wei's other connections: \n10. Visited set: {Moin, Pari, Reza, Puja, Wei}\n    - Queue: Kim\n    - Dequeue Kim\n    - Kim is already visited, skip.\n    - Enqueue Kim's other connections: \n11. Visited set: {Moin, Pari, Reza, Puja, Wei, Kim}\n    - Queue: \n12. The queue is empty, and we haven't found Sara. There is no path from Moin to Sara.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Moin to Sara."
