Since Moin is already in the list, we skip Reza.\n- Moin is not connected to Nisha.\n- Puja is not connected to Nisha.\n\nNow, we move to the next level of connections:\n\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since Moin and Pari are already in the list, we skip Amir.\n- Reza is not connected to Nisha.\n- Moin is not connected to Nisha.\n- Puja is connected to Pam. Since Pam is not in the list, we add Pam to the list.\n\nNext, we move to the next level of connections:\n\n- Amir is not connected to Nisha.\n- Reza is not connected to Nisha.\n- Moin is not connected to Nisha.\n- Puja is not connected to Nisha.\n- Pam is connected to Kim. Since Kim is not in the list, we add Kim to the list.\n\nFinally, we move to the next level of connections:\n\n- Amir is not connected to Nisha.\n- Reza is not connected to Nisha.\n- Moin is not connected to Nisha.\n- Puja is not connected to Nisha.\n- Pam is not connected to Nisha.\n- Kim is connected to Nisha.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pari to Nisha is: Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim, Nisha."
