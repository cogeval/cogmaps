Check if Moin is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is just Moin and Nisha.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections: Reza and Pari.\n4. Check if Reza is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Reza, and Nisha.\n5. If not, check Reza's connections: Moin, Pari, and Max.\n6. Check if Moin (again) is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Reza, Moin, and Nisha.\n7. If not, check Pari's connections: Moin.\n8. Check if Moin (again) is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, Moin, and Nisha.\n9. If not, check Max's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Nisha.\n10. Check if Reza (again) is connected to Nisha.

If not, check Pari (again) is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, Max, Reza, Pari, and Nisha.\n13. If not, check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n14.
