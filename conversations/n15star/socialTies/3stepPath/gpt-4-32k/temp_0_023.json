Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. Pam has no further connections.\n\nFrom Wim, we can't reach Ian directly. So, we need to find a scholar who is connected to Ian. \n\n1. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n2. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n3. Sara is connected to Max.\n4. Max has no further connections.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Raj and Nisha are connected to Ian. But neither Raj nor Nisha are in Wim's connections. So, we need to find a scholar who is connected to either Raj or Nisha and is in Wim's connections.\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari has no further connections.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Puja is in Wim's connections and is connected to Amir.
