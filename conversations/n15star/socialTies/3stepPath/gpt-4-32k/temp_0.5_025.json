Wim is directly connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nNext, I will find out if any of these scholars are directly connected to Reza. From the information given, none of them are directly connected to Reza.\n\nThen, I will check the scholars who are directly connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam respectively. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is connected to Pam. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is not connected to anyone else.\n\nNone of these scholars are directly connected to Reza.\n\nNow, I will check the scholars who are directly connected to Kim and Puja (since Wei and Pam do not have any other connections). Kim is connected to Pam and Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nPam is not connected to Reza.\n\nSo, I will have to go back to Wim's connections and see their connections again. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is connected to Pam. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nNow, I will check the scholars who are connected to Pam. Pam is not connected to anyone else.\n\nSo, I will have to go back to Wim's connections and see their connections again. This time, I will check the scholars who are connected to Wei. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nKim and Puja are not connected to Reza.\n\nSo, I will have to go back to Wim's connections and see their connections again. This time, I will check the scholars who are connected to Puja. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nPam is not connected to Reza.\n\nSo, I will have to go back to Wim's connections and see their connections again. This time, I will check the scholars who are connected to Kim. Kim is connected to Pam.\n\nPam is not connected to Reza.\n\nSo, it appears that there is no direct path from Wim to Reza through the scholars Wim is connected to.\n\nThe only other option is to see if any of the scholars Wim is connected to are connected to the scholars Reza is connected to. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n\nChecking the connections again, I find that Amir is connected to Reza.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Reza is through Puja and Amir.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wim to Reza is: Wim, Puja, Amir, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Amir, Reza."
