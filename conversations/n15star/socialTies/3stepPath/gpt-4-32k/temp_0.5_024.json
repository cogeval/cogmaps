Kim is connected to Pam.\n4. Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. Pam has no further connections.\n\nFrom Wim, none of his direct connections lead to Sara. So, we need to look at the connections of his connections (second degree connections):\n\n1. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n2. Kim is connected to Pam.\n3. Puja is connected to Pam.\n4. Pam has no further connections.\n\nAgain, none of these second degree connections lead to Sara. This means we have to look at the third degree connections:\n\n1. Kim is connected to Pam.\n2. Puja is connected to Pam.\n3. Pam has no further connections.\n\nStill, we haven't found a connection to Sara. This means we need to reconsider the initial connections and find a different path. Let's go back to Wim's initial connections:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n2. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Kim is connected to Raj (from the initial information given).\n\nNow, let's look at Raj's connections:\n\n1. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nHere, we find a direct connection to Sara. So, the shortest path from Wim to Sara is: Wim - Kim - Raj - Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim, Raj, Sara."
