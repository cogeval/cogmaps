Neither Wei nor Pam have a direct connection to Sara, so they are not viable paths.\n3. Kim is directly connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to Sara, so Kim is also not a viable path. \n4. Puja is directly connected to Pam, but again, Pam is not connected to Sara. Thus, no direct connections from Wim lead to Sara.\n5. Next, I'll move to the connections of Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam to look for indirect connections.\n6. Wei is connected to Kim and Puja, and Kim and Puja are both connected to Pam, but none of these connections lead to Sara.\n7. Therefore, I have to find a connection from another scholar to Sara.\n8. Raj is connected to Sara directly. So, I have to find a path from Wim to Raj. \n9. Wim is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Raj. \n\nBased on these observations, the shortest path from Wim to Sara is through Kim and Raj. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim, Raj, Sara"
