Pari is only connected to Moin and Reza, so it's not an option for the shortest path. Reza, however, is connected to Amir and Jing.\n\nThird, find who Amir and Jing are connected to. Amir is connected to Puja and Puja is connected to Wim. On the other hand, Jing is connected to Max and Max is connected to Sara.\n\nFourth, from Wim, we see Wim is connected to Wei. From Sara, we know Sara is connected to Ian and then Ian is connected to Nisha. Wei is not connected to Nisha.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Moin to Nisha is Moin, Reza, Amir, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Raj, Ian, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Reza, Amir, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Raj, Ian, Nisha."
