Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. Pam has no further connections. \n\nNone of Wim's direct connections lead to Nisha. So, we need to explore the second degree connections:\n\n1. Wei's second degree connections are the same as Wim's direct connections, which don't lead to Nisha.\n2. Kim's second degree connection is Pam, which doesn't lead to Nisha.\n3. Puja's second degree connection is Pam, which doesn't lead to Nisha.\n4. Pam has no second degree connections.\n\nTherefore, there is no direct or second degree connection from Wim to Nisha. Now, let's check the connections from Nisha:\n\n1. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n2. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n3. Sara is connected to Max.\n4. Max has no further connections.\n\nNone of Nisha's direct connections lead to Wim. So, we need to explore the second degree connections:\n\n1. Ian's second degree connections are Sara and Max, which don't lead to Wim.\n2. Sara's second degree connection is Max, which doesn't lead to Wim.\n3. Max has no second degree connections.\n\nTherefore, there is no direct or second degree connection from Nisha to Wim. \n\nHowever, we missed one connection from the original description: Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Kim is connected to Wim. So, the shortest path from Wim to Nisha is through Kim and Raj.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim, Raj, Nisha"
