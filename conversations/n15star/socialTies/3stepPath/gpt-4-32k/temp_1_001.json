Salma is connected to: Shanshan, Vadim, and Noah.\n   b. Shanshan is connected to: Vadim, Salma, and Noah.\n   c. Vadim is connected to: Shanshan, Salma, and Noah.\n   d. Gongxue is connected to: Alice, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Vivian.\n4. Repeat the process for each student's connections:\n   a. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are all connected to Noah, who is connected to Anisha. This would result in the path: Vivian -> Salma (or Shanshan or Vadim) -> Noah -> Anisha.\n   b. Gongxue is connected to Alice, who is connected to Soheil, who is connected to Anisha. This would result in the path: Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil -> Anisha.\n5. Compare the two paths and choose the shortest one.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Noah, Anisha"
