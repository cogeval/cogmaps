Map out the connections that exist from the starting point. Wim is directly connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Reza is not directly connected to Wim.\n3. Now, we'll look at who the nodes connected to Wim are themselves connected to and find a connection to Reza. Wei, Kim, and Pam don't provide any direct paths to Reza.\n4. Puja is connected to Wim and also connected to Amir.\n5. Amir is directly connected to Reza.\n\nFrom these steps, it is clear that the shortest path from Wim to Reza is Wim -> Puja -> Amir -> Reza.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Amir, Reza"
