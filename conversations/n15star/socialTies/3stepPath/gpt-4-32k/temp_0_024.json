Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. Pam has no further connections.\n\nFrom Wim, we can't reach Sara directly. So, we need to find a scholar who is connected to Sara. From the given information, Raj and Ian are connected to Sara. \n\n1. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n2. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n\nFrom Wim's connections, Kim is the only scholar who is connected to Raj. So, the shortest path from Wim to Sara would be through Kim and Raj. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wim to Sara is: Wim, Kim, Raj, Sara. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim, Raj, Sara."
