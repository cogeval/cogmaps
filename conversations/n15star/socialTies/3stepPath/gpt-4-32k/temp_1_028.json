Check Salma's connections: Salma is connected to Noah, Shanshan, and Vadim, but not to Anisha or any of Anisha's connected friends.\n4. Check Shanshan's connections: Shanshan is connected to Salma, Vadim, and Noah, but not to Anisha or any of Anisha's connected friends.\n5. Check Vadim's connections: Vadim is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, and Noah, but not to Anisha or any of Anisha's connected friends.\n6. Consider the next layer of connections from Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n7. Check Noah's connections: Noah is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha.\n8.
