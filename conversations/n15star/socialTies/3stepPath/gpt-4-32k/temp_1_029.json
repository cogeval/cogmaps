Kim is connected to Pam, so doesn't lead towards Ian. Puja is connected to Pam, which doesn't lead to Ian. Pam doesn't have any other connections mentioned, so we cannot go further in this path.\n\nStep 3: Since no direct connections lead to Ian, we need to check connections of the second level. Kim is connected to Wim and Wei. Neither Wim or Wei is connected to Ian. \n\nStep 4: Puja is connected to Amir, and Wim, and Pam. Wim is already checked. Check connections of Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. But none of them are connected to Ian. \n\nStep 5: We conclude that we can't find a path from Wei to Ian.\n\nAnswer: No path found."
