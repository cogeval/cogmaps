Check if Vivian and Anisha are in the same group - they are not.\n\n3. Find the groups where Vivian is connected to someone who is also connected to Anisha:\n   Group 1 and Group 4 have Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim in common.\n\n4. Since the common connection is through Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim, choose the shortest path:\n   Vivian -> Salma -> Anisha\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha"
