Reza is directly connected to Amir, Jing, Moin, and Pari. \nNext, we need to see if any of these scholars are connected to Nisha directly or indirectly. \n\n1. Amir is not connected to Nisha.\n2. Jing is not connected to Nisha.\n3. Moin is not connected to Nisha.\n4. Pari is not connected to Nisha.\n\nSince none of the scholars connected to Reza are directly connected to Nisha, we need to take one step further.\n\n1. Amir is connected to Puja, who is not connected to Nisha.\n2. Jing is connected to Max, who is connected to Nisha.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari, who is not connected to Nisha.\n4. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Reza to Nisha is through Jing and Max. \n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing, Max, Nisha."
