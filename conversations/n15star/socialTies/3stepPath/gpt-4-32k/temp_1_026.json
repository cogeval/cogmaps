Find paths from Vivian to Anisha, considering group connections:\n   Path 1: Vivian (Group 1) -> Salma (Group 4) -> Anisha\n   Path 2: Vivian (Group 1) -> Shanshan (Group 4) -> Anisha\n   Path 3: Vivian (Group 1) -> Vadim (Group 4) -> Anisha\n\n3. Determine the shortest path:\n   All paths are of equal length (2 connections), so any of the paths can be considered the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha"
