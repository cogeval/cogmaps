Kim is connected to Pam and Wim.\nFourth, I will identify the connections from Wim. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. \nFifth, since Wim's connections lead back to scholars already visited or to dead ends, I will go back to Wei and explore the other connections. \nSixth, I will identify the connections from Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, Wim, and Amir. \nSeventh, I will identify the connections from Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \nEighth, I will identify the connections from Reza, Moin, and Pari. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari and Jing. Pari is connected to Moin and Jing.\nNinth, I will identify the connections from Jing. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\nTenth, I will identify the connections from Max. Max is connected to Jing, Nisha, Ian, and Sara. \nEleventh, I will identify the connections from Nisha, Ian, and Sara. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.
