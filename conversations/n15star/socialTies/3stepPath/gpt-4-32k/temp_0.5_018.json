Salma is connected to Noah and Shanshan, but neither of them is connected to Anisha.\n4. Shanshan is connected to Salma, Vadim, and Noah, but none of them is connected to Anisha.\n5. Vadim is connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Noah, but none of them is connected to Anisha.\n6. None of these paths lead to Anisha, so we need to find another connection.\n7. Vivian is also connected to Gongxue.\n8. Gongxue is connected to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n9. Soheil is connected to Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Alice.\n10. Abdul and Durga are connected to Ajit, but not Anisha.\n11. Ajit is connected to Anisha.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Ajit, Anisha"
