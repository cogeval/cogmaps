The scholars Puja is connected to are: Pam, Wim, and Wei.\nStep 4: The connections from Pam don't lead to Raj. Move on to Wim.\nStep 5: From Wim, check the connections to Wei, Kim, and Pam. None of them directly lead to Raj.\nStep 6: Move to the next scholar, Wei.\nStep 7: From Wei, check the connections to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is the only scholar in this list not yet considered in the earlier steps.\nStep 8: From Kim, check her connections. She is connected to Pam and Wim. None of them directly lead to Raj.\nStep 9: Return to the initial list of scholars Puja is connected to. All potential paths have been checked without finding a connection to Raj.\nStep 10: Now consider a path of length 3. From Puja to Wim to Wei to Kim.\nStep 11: Check the connections from Kim again. She is connected to Pam and Wim. None of them directly lead to Raj.\nStep 12: The path of length 3 was not successful. Consider a path of length 4. From Puja to Wim to Wei to Kim to Pam.\nStep 13: Pam doesn't lead to Raj. So, this path is not successful. \nStep 14: The search for a path continues. Consider a new path from Puja to Amir to Reza to Moin.\nStep 15: Moin doesn't lead to Raj. So, this path is not successful.\nStep 16: The search for a path continues. Consider a new path from Puja to Amir to Reza to Jing.\nStep 17: Jing doesn't lead to Raj. So, this path is not successful.\nStep 18: Continue the search. A path from Puja to Wim to Kim to Raj is found. \n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim, Kim, Raj."
