None of them are.\n\nThen, I will check the connections of Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is connected to Pam. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam has no further connections listed.\n\nSince none of these connections lead to Pari, I will check the next level of connections. Wei, Kim, and Puja are all connected to Pam, but Pam has no connections to Pari. \n\nNext, I will check the connections of the scholars connected to Wei, Kim, and Puja. Wei is connected to Kim and Puja, who are both connected to Pam, but none of these connections lead to Pari. \n\nKim is only connected to Pam, who has no connections to Pari. \n\nPuja is connected to Pam, who has no connections to Pari. \n\nSince none of these paths lead to Pari, I will check the connections of the scholars connected to Amir, since Amir is connected to Pari. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nPuja is connected to Wim, so the shortest path from Wim to Pari is through Puja and Amir. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Amir, Pari."
