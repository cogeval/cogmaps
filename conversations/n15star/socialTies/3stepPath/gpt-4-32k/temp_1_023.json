Vadim is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, and Noah.\n   d. Gongxue is connected to Vivian, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n4. Find Anisha's connections: Anisha is connected to Noah, Abdul, Durga, Ajit.\n5. Look for the shortest path from Vivian's first-degree connections to Anisha:\n   a. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim have Noah as their common connection with Anisha.\n   b. Gongxue connects to Anisha through Alice and Soheil (Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil -> Anisha).\n\n6. Compare the lengths of the paths:\n   a. Vivian -> Salma -> Noah -> Anisha (3 connections)\n   b. Vivian -> Shanshan -> Noah -> Anisha (3 connections)\n   c. Vivian -> Vadim -> Noah -> Anisha (3 connections)\n   d. Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil -> Anisha (4 connections)\n\nThe shortest path from Vivian to Anisha is through Salma or Shanshan or Vadim, with 3 connections in total.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Noah, Anisha"
