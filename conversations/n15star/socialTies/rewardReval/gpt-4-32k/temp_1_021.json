Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

In this case, it is Kim who has donated 50 books. \n\nNext, determine the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\nThe connections for Amir are: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nNone of these are directly connected to Kim. So, look at the second layer of connections:\n\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Pari.\nPari has no additional connections.\nPuja is connected to Pam.\n\nStill, none of these are directly connected to Kim. So, continue to the third layer:\n\nPam is connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who donated the most books (Kim) is through Puja and then Pam. \n\nThe scholar names in order are: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."

The path via Jing will be shorter as Jing is connected to Reza, who is connected to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who donated the most books (Max) is through Reza and then Jing.\n\nThe scholar names in order are: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max."
