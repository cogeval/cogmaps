Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So Kim is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nSecond, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nLet's start from Amir:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n2. None of these scholars is Kim, so I'll proceed with the connections of these scholars.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari, but not Kim.\n4. Moin is connected to Pari, but not Kim.\n5. Pari is not connected to Kim.\n6. Puja, however, is connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim) is: Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

Reza, Moin, and Pari do not have any connection with Max.\n9. Ian, who is connected with Raj, is connected to Max, but this path is not available to Amir as he has no direct or indirect connection with Raj or Ian.\n10. However, Jing, who is connected to Reza, is also connected to Max. And Reza is directly connected to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max) is: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max."
