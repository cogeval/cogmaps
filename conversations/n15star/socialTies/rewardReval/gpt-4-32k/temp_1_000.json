From Salma, we have connections to Shanshan, Vadim, Noah, and Anisha.\n3. From Shanshan, we have connections to Vadim, Salma, and Anisha.\n4. From Vadim, we have connections to Salma, Shanshan, and Anisha.\n5. From Gongxue, we have connections to Alice, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Anisha.\n\nThe shortest path to Alice from Vivian's connections is through Gongxue, as it's a direct connection:\n\nVivian -> Gongxue -> Alice\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Alice"
