Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From there, I'll start with Amir since that's our starting point. \n\nAmir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nNext, I'll look at who those four scholars are connected to. \n\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari, who are already on Amir's direct connections list. \n\nMoin is connected to Pari, who is again on Amir's direct connections list. \n\nPari is not connected to any other scholars not already on the list.\n\nPuja is connected to Pam. \n\nAt this point, we haven't reached either Kim or Max, the two scholars who are donating books. \n\nSo next, I need to expand the list to include the scholars connected to Puja and Pam. Pam is directly connected to Wim, Wei, and Kim. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nLooking at this expanded list, we see that Kim is connected to both Pam and Wei, who are in turn connected to Puja, who is directly connected to Amir. \n\nSince Kim is the one who is donating the maximum number of books, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be through Puja and Pam. \n\nSo the order of scholars would be: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nWe are asked to list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas. The answer will then be as follows. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"

However, since there is no direct path from Amir to Jing, we need to find another way. \n\nWe can see from the list that Raj is also connected to Max. \n\nTo get to Raj, the path starts at Amir, who is connected to Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Wei. Wei is connected to Wim, who is also connected to Kim. Finally, Kim is connected to Raj, who is connected to Max. \n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Max would be: Amir, Puja, Pam, Wei, Wim, Kim, Raj, Max. \n\nWe are asked to list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.
