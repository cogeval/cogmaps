Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, it is Kim who is donating 50 books.\n\nStep 2: From the given relationships, find the connections of Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Determine if Kim is in the connections of Amir. As Kim is not directly connected to Amir, go one level deeper and check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 4: Kim is not directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, but is directly connected to Puja.\n\nStep 5: Hence, the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is Amir to Puja to Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

As Max is not directly connected to Amir, go one level deeper and check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 4: Max is not directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari or Puja. So, go one level deeper and check the connections of the individuals connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 5: From these connections, we can see that Max is directly connected to Jing and Sara who are in turn connected to Amir through Reza and Raj respectively.\n\nStep 6: The shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books can be either Amir to Reza to Jing to Max or Amir to Raj to Sara to Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max."
