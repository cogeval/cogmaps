Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Between Kim and Max, Kim is donating 50 books which is the maximum. \n\nThen, let's try to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\n1. Start from Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Puja is the first direct connection to Kim, through Wim.\n4. However, Amir is not directly connected to Wim. \n5. Looking at other connections, Amir is also connected to Pari.\n6. However, Pari is not connected to anyone who is connected to Kim.\n7. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nThis means that the path from Amir to Kim (who is donating the maximum number of books) is: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim."

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. None of these people are directly connected to Max.\n4. However, Amir is also connected to Jing through Moin and Reza.\n5. Jing is directly connected to Max.\n6.
