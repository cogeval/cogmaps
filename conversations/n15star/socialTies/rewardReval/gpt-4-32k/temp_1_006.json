Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, it's Kim with 50 books. \n\nStep 2: Find the connections to Kim from Amir. \n\nStep 3: Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since none of these individuals are directly connected to Kim, I need to check their connections. \n\nStep 4: Kim is connected to Pam, Wei, and Wim. The only intersecting name with Amir's connection is Puja. \n\nStep 5: Hence, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books would be through Puja to Kim. \n\nFinal Outcome: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."
