Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, it is Kim who is donating 50 books, which is more than Max's 10 books.\n\nStep 2: Plot the connections between the scholars. \n\nStep 3: From Amir, find the shortest path to Kim. \n\nAmir's immediate connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nStep 4: Check the immediate connections of Amir and find out if any of them are connected to Kim. \n\nReza and Moin don't have a connection to Kim. Pari also doesn't have a connection to Kim. Puja is directly connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim) is Amir --> Puja --> Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

But Pari doesn't have a connection to Max. Puja also doesn't have a direct connection to Max. \nSo, we need to take another step to reach Max.\n\nStep 5: Check the second level connections to find out the shortest path to Max. \n\nJing is connected to Max and Jing is connected to Amir via Reza. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max) is Amir --> Reza --> Jing --> Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Max"
