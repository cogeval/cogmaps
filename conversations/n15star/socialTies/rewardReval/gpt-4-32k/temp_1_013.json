Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

He's connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nOut of the scholars Amir is directly connected to, none of them is a donor, but they might be connected to the donors.\n\nAmir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja) are connected to other scholars as well. \n\nReza and Moin are connected to each other, but they're also connected to Jing, who is not a donor and does not connect to a donor either. Thus, Reza and Moin are not helpful in this case. \n\nPuja is connected to Wim, Wei, and Pam. Wim is connected to Wei, who is connected to the donor Kim. However, since Kim is donating less than Max, we can ignore this path.\n\nPari is not connected to any other scholar that hasn't been accounted for yet, so this path also does not lead to a donor.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is finding the shortest path from Amir to Max. \n\nThe quickest way from Amir to Max is through Nisha and Sara, and since Nisha is connected to Raj, this path begins with Raj. \n\nStarting from Amir, the shortest path to the scholar donating the maximum number of books (Max) is:\n\nAmir -> Raj -> Nisha -> Sara -> Max.\n\nThis is the shortest path to the scholar donating the maximum number of books. In conclusion, Amir will have to go through Raj, Nisha, and Sara to reach Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Sara, Max."
