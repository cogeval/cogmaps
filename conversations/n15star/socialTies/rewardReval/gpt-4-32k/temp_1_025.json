Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for connecting with Alice. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are also connected to each other, but not connected to Alice. Therefore, the path through Gongxue is the shortest.\n\n4. Gongxue is connected to Alice.\n\n5. So, the shortest connection path from Vivian to Alice is: Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice.\n\n6. Since Alice is the only student with a reward associated with connecting, and we have found the shortest path to Alice, we do not need to look for other students that yield rewards.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Alice"
