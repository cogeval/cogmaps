In this case, it's Kim who is donating 50 books, which is more than Max who is donating 10 books.\n\nStep 2: Find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. Looking at the connections, Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\nStep 3: Since Kim is not directly connected to Amir, we need to find a path through Amir's connections. \n\nStep 4: Checking Amir's connections, we see that Puja is connected to Kim.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
