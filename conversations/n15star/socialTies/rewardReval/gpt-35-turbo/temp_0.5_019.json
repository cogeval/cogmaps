Add the connected scholars to a queue.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating books. If yes, mark this scholar as the maximum book donor and break the loop.\n   c. If the dequeued scholar is not the maximum book donor, check if they are connected to any other scholars who are donating books.\n   d. If yes, add the connected scholars to the queue.\n5.
