Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections and keep track of the number of books they are donating. We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar. Set the value for Kim as 50 and the value for Max as 10.\n4. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and check if they are donating more books than the current maximum.\n   c. If they are donating more books, update the maximum number of books donated and the scholar's name.\n   d. Add all the unvisited connections of the current scholar to the queue.\n   e. Update the number of books donated by each connection by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n6.
