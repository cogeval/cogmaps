Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue, along with the path taken so far (which is just Amir).\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue (Reza) and check if they are donating the maximum number of books. If not, add their connected scholars (Moin and Pari) to the queue, along with the updated path (Amir, Reza).\n5. Repeat step 4 for each scholar in the queue until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max).\n6. Return the path taken to reach Max, including Amir.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja].\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue (Reza):\n   - Reza is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Add Reza's connected scholars (Moin and Pari) to the queue: [Moin, Pari, Puja].\n   - Update the path taken so far: Amir, Reza.\n5. Take the next scholar from the queue (Moin):\n   - Moin is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Add Moin's connected scholar (Pari) to the queue: [Pari, Puja].\n   - Update the path taken so far: Amir, Reza, Moin.\n6. Take the next scholar from the queue (Pari):\n   - Pari is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Pari has no connected scholars.\n   - The queue is now: [Puja].\n   - Update the path taken so far: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari.\n7. Take the next scholar from the queue (Puja):\n   - Puja is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Puja has no connected scholars.\n   - The queue is now empty.\n   - The shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books (Puja) is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja"
