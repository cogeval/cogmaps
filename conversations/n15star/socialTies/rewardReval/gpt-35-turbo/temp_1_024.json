We will continue traversing until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with Amir.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar is donating.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0 and the shortest path from Amir to Amir as [Amir].\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the maximum number of books seen so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the path to the current scholar.\n   - Check if the scholar has any connected scholars.\n   - If yes, enqueue the connected scholars, update their number of books donated and the shortest path to them.\n6. Once the queue is empty, the shortest path to the person donating the maximum number of books is stored in the path dictionary for that person.\n\nNow, let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with Amir: [Amir]\n2. Initialize the number of books dictionary: {Amir: 0}\n3. Initialize the shortest path dictionary: {Amir: [Amir]}\n4.

Since Reza is not donating any books, we do not update the maximum number of books or the path.\n     - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.
