Starting from Amir, we will explore each connected scholar one by one until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Reza, Moin, Pari, or Puja is donating the maximum number of books. None of them is donating the maximum, so we continue.\n3. Explore the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. We add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue.\n4. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n5. Check if Reza is donating the maximum number of books. Reza is not donating any books, so we continue.\n6. Explore the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. We add Moin, Pari, and Max to the queue.\n7. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Moin.\n8. Check if Moin is donating the maximum number of books. Moin is not donating any books, so we continue.\n9.
