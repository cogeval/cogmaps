Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to anyone who is donating books. If yes, go to step 5.\n3. If not, check if any of Amir's connections are connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, go to step 5.\n4. If not, continue the search by checking the connections of Amir's connections. Repeat steps 2-4 until a connection to someone donating books is found.\n5. Once a connection to someone donating books is found, add that person to the path and stop the search.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. None of these connections are donating books.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n4. Moin is not donating books, but Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n5. Pari is donating books, so the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Answer: Amir, Pari.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is Amir, Pari."
