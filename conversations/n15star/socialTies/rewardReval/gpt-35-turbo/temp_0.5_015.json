Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to him and keep track of the number of books each person is donating. We will continue this process until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start from Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar, starting with 0 for all.\n5. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated, starting with 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and store the scholar's name.\n   - Add all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar to the queue.\n   - Update the number of books donated by each connected scholar.\n7. Repeat step 6 until the queue is empty.\n8. The scholar with the maximum number of books donated is the final outcome.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given scenario:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
