Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

If yes, add the scholar to the path list and stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who are not visited yet.\n   - Mark all the enqueued scholars as visited.\n5.
