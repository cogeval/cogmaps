Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

If none of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books, add Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja) to a queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to the dequeued scholar.\n   - If not, add the dequeued scholar's connections (excluding Amir and already visited scholars) to the queue.\n   - Update the path by adding the dequeued scholar to the end.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\n1.
