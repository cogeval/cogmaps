Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check if any of the scholars in the queue (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja) are donating the maximum number of books (50). If yes, return the path from Amir to that scholar.\n4. If none of the scholars in the queue are donating the maximum number of books, remove Amir from the queue.\n5.
