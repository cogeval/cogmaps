Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar is donating.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars' names and initialize it with Amir.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar and initialize it with Amir: 0.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar and initialize it with Amir: 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than the previous maximum donation, update the maximum donation.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books, return the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n   - For each connection of the scholar:\n     - If the connection has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the connection.\n       - Update the distance and number of books dictionaries.\n       - Update the path to include the current connection.\n       - Mark the connection as visited.\n\nThe final outcome will be the shortest path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari, Moin, Reza, Max"

Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar and initialize it with Amir: 0.\n5. Create a dictionary to store the previous scholar in the shortest path to each scholar and initialize it with Amir: None.\n6.
