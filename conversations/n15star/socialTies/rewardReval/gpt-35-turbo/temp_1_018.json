Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections and calculate the number of books donated by each person along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it. Also, create an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\n3. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n\n4. If the scholar has not been visited yet, update the number of books donated by the scholar in the dictionary. If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books so far, update the maximum number of books and the corresponding scholar.\n\n5. Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and mark them as visited.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.\n\n7. The final result will be the path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books. We can obtain this path by backtracking from the maximum donating scholar to Amir using the dictionary of connections.\n\nLet's implement these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
