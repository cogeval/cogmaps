Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

If not, explore the connections of these scholars (excluding already explored scholars) and repeat step 3.\n5. Continue this process until we find a scholar who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max).\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Explore Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. None of them are donating the maximum number of books, so explore their connections.\n4. Explore Wim (connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam), but none of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n5.
