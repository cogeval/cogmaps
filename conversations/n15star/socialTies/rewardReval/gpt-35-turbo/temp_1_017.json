Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Moin is not connected to any other person donating books, so we move to the next person in the path from Amir. Reza is also connected to Pari, who is not connected to any other person donating books either. Next, we move to the next person connected to Amir, which is Puja. Puja is connected to Kim, who is connected to Pam. However, Pam is not donating the maximum number of books. \n\nSince there are no other connections from Amir that lead to the person donating the maximum number of books, the path ends here. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"
