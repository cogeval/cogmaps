Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Set the number of books donated by Kim to 50 and Max to 10.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - If the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum:\n       - Update the maximum number of books and the scholar donating them.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n6.
