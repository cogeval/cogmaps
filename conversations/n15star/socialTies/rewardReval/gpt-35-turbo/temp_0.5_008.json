However, neither Moin nor Pari are donating any books.\n\nNext, we move to Moin. Moin is connected to Pari, but Pari is also not donating any books.\n\nNow, we move to Pari. Pari is connected to Moin, but Moin is not donating any books.\n\nFinally, we move to Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, and Kim.
