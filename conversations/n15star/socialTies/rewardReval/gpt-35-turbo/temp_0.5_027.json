Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Initialize the queue with Amir and set the shortest path from Amir to Amir as an empty list.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max).\n   - If yes, return the shortest path from Amir to the current scholar.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   - Update the shortest path from Amir to each newly visited scholar by appending the current scholar to the path.\n5.
