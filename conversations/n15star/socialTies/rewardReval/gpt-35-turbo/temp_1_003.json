Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n3. Enqueue Amir to the queue.\n4. Create an empty list to store the visited nodes.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the node is not already visited, add it to the visited list.\n   - Check if the node is the person donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search.\n   - If not, enqueue all the connected nodes of the current node that are not already visited.\n6. If the search is stopped because we found the person donating the maximum number of books, return the list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.\n7. If the search is completed and the person donating the maximum number of books is not found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nFollowing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a distance value to each scholar. Set the initial distance value for Amir as 0 and infinity for all other scholars.\n2. Create an empty set to store visited nodes.\n3. Create a priority queue to store the nodes to be visited, with the distance value as the priority.\n4. Enqueue Amir to the priority queue with a distance value of 0.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the scholar with the minimum distance value from the priority queue.\n   - If the scholar is already visited, skip it.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Update the distance value for all connected scholars, considering the number of books they are donating. If the updated distance value is smaller than the previous value, enqueue the scholar to the priority queue.\n6. If the person donating the maximum number of books is found, stop the search.\n7. If the search is completed and the person donating the maximum number of books is not found, return \"No path found.\"\n8. Return the shortest path by backtracking from the person donating the maximum number of books to Amir.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
