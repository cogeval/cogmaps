Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first person from the queue.\n   b. Check if this person is donating books. If yes, this is the person who is donating the maximum number of books. Stop the search.\n   c. If not, add all the people connected to this person (who have not been visited before) to the queue.\n4.

We continue with the next person in the queue.\n12. Queue: Puja, Moin, Pari, Pari\n13. Dequeue Puja.\n14. Puja is connected to Pam. Kim is donating the maximum number of books, but Puja is not connected to Kim. So we continue with the next person in the queue.\n15. Queue: Moin, Pari, Pari\n16. Dequeue Moin.\n17. Moin is not connected to anyone else. We continue with the next person in the queue.\n18. Queue: Pari, Pari\n19. Dequeue Pari.\n20. Pari is not connected to anyone else. We continue with the next person in the queue.\n21. Queue: Pari\n22. Dequeue Pari.\n23. Pari is not connected to anyone else. The queue is empty, and we haven't found anyone who is donating books.
