Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable \"max_books\" to 0 and a variable \"path\" to an empty list.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - If the scholar is donating more books than \"max_books\":\n       - Update \"max_books\" to the number of books donated by the scholar.\n       - Update \"path\" to the current path taken.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar into the queue.\n5. Return the \"path\" as the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given scenario:\n\n1. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n2.

Enqueue Pam into the queue.\n16. Dequeue Pam.\n17. Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max into the queue.\n18. Dequeue Nisha.\n19. Enqueue Ian, Sara, and Max into the queue.\n20. Dequeue Ian.\n21. Enqueue Sara and Max into the queue.\n22. Dequeue Sara.\n23. Enqueue Max into the queue.\n24.
