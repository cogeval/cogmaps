Check the connections of each scholar that Amir is connected to.\n   - For Reza, the connections are Moin and Pari.\n   - For Moin, there are no additional connections.\n   - For Pari, there are no additional connections.\n   - For Puja, the connections are Kim and Pam.\n4. Repeat the process for each of the new connections, checking their connections as well.\n   - For Moin, there are no additional connections.\n   - For Pari, there are no additional connections.\n   - For Kim, the connection is Pam.\n   - For Pam, there are no additional connections.\n5.
