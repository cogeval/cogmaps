Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to someone who is donating books.\n3. If yes, check the number of books donated.\n4. If the number of books donated is maximum, stop and provide the answer.\n5. If not, add Amir's connections to the BFS queue.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the queue is empty or the maximum number of books donated is found.\n\nUsing the given connections, we start with Amir and check his connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating books.\n\nNext, we add Amir's connections to the BFS queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nWe continue the BFS algorithm, considering each connection one by one and adding their connections to the queue.\n\nThe next person in the queue is Reza. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. None of them are donating books. So, we add Moin and Pari to the queue.\n\nThe next person in the queue is Moin. Moin is connected to Pari. None of them are donating books.\n\nThe next person in the queue is Pari. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n\nThe next person in the queue is Puja. Puja is connected to Pam. Kim is not connected to Puja. So, we add Pam to the queue.\n\nThe next person in the queue is Pam. Pam is connected to Kim. Kim is donating 50 books, which is the maximum number of books donated.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is:\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
