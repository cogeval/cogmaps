Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (Max with 10 books). If so, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who are not already visited.\n   - Add the current scholar to the visited set.\n4. If the loop ends without finding the person donating the maximum number of books, it means there is no path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow let's execute the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Max"
