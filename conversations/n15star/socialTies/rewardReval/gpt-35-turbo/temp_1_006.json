Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will also keep track of the maximum number of books donated by any scholar encountered so far.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue to store the scholars to visit.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar, starting with Amir as distance 0.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated, starting with 0.\n5. Initialize a variable to store the name of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n     a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n     b. Mark the scholar as visited.\n     c. Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books donated and the corresponding scholar's name.\n     d. Iterate over the connections of the scholar:\n         i. If a connected scholar has not been visited:\n              - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n              - Update the distance of the connected scholar from Amir.\n              - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n8. Once the queue is empty, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books is stored in the distance dictionary. We can retrieve this path by starting from the scholar donating the maximum number of books and following the path of scholars with decreasing distances until we reach Amir.\n\nNow let's apply this process step-by-step to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
