Follow below steps. Are your ready assistant. Below task would help scholors know there connections\nFirstly list Scholar Names as given in Task except Amirs name ending every name with connecting Scholin that is available to take books\nSecond calculate  how many books Each scholar connected, Scholar Name, Books they posses initially, Then calculate how many book each can lone (only one person allowed). Calculate  Total Books count by summmning all initial Books, Books one's lend their own books too add on total count\nfinally Finds scholas with largest Total, Scholar Name End of chain.Please ready reply with  I Understand above Step as ready reply. Let proceed. Is there any thing further youd want ask the User? (Note: kindly ensure last scholar you give Is ending with Scholar Whoms Books one going to take inorderto Calculate and shortest possible Donating path?\n\nAnswer: The goal is to maximize the number of books the path donates. A donating chain for books is a connection between some number of scholars with donatable books by only sparing some scholors a book at a most economical source or least time or at fewer schols to travel by least donatated cost while visiting the least no of scholas possible in optimal least no time from scholas chosen at any instant to the next in this path the scholars donatable links ends with the most earliest possible path terminology, meaning all are shortest to path the cost terminates on schemas or scholis of optimal no such that cost terminology\nGiven Amir starts with an initial donate quantity( Zero here and need maximum possible from chosen next scholas by minimum of connections in choosing first next connected schollar (first link in one chain ) among possible n+1 links (including from starting first person in that sequence,amir  here.
