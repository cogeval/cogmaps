Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

It is optional.\nFor people who use English as their native language, I would like to mention that you can use lowercase. In this problem, it's quite possible that you will get an answer like 'Amir,Puja,Wei,Wim,Moin,Ian,Sara,Kim,Pam,Max' and then have some problem as this is a bit different from 'Amir,Puja,Wei,Wim,Moin,Ian,Sara,Kim,Pam,Max'. This is because punctuations like comma will be interpreted as a part of string too.\n\"Amir, Puja, Wei, Wim, Moin, Ian, Sara, Kim,,Pam\" would also count as an answer.\n\"Amir,Puja,Wei,Wim,Moin,Ian,Sara,Kim,Pam,Max,Reza,Jing,Nisha,KI\"m,Ian,Pam\" would also count as an answer.\nFor people who use English as their native language, I'd like to tell that space is an optional character but should be present in the problem. The best place to see an answer like this would be on a web page.\n\"Amir, Pui, Wei, Wim, Moin, Ian, Sara, Kim,,Pam\" would also count as an answer.\n\"Amir,Puji,wei,Wim,Moin,Ian,Sara,Kim,,Pam\" would also count as an answer.\nIf there are any ambiguity in my description, I can provide my own sample responses and the original problem in question.\nYou've already mentioned"
