I created a graph with the scholars as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n2. I labeled each node with the number of books that the corresponding scholar is donating.\n3. I found the shortest path from Amir to Kim using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path is:\n\n```\nAmir -> Sara -> Kim\n```\n\nI then listed the scholars in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Kim\n```"
