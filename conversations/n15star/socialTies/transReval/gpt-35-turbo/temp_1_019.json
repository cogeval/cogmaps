Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Create an empty list to store the shortest path from Amir.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   2. If the scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books, add their name to the shortest path list and break the loop.\n   3. If the scholar has not been visited:\n      1. Add the scholar to the visited set.\n      2. Add the scholar's connections to the queue.\n      3. Add the scholar's connections to the connections dictionary.\n      4. If the scholar is connected to a scholar who has donated more books than the current maximum, update the maximum.\n   4.
