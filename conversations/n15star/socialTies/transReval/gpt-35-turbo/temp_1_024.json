Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari\n2. Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Max\n3. Amir -> Reza -> Pari\n4. Amir -> Reza -> Pari -> Max\n5. Amir -> Pari\n6.

Max: 10 books\n\nSince Max is donating the maximum number of books (10 books), the shortest path from Amir to Max is:\n\nAmir, Reza, Pari, Max\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Max"

Amir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Max\n   - Books donated by Max: 10\n\nBased on the paths and number of books donated, it is evident that Max is still the person donating the maximum number of books (10 books).
