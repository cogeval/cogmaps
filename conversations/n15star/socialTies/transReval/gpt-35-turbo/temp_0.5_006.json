Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n5. Check Pari's connections: No further connections.\n6. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n7. Check Pam's connections: No further connections.\n\nSince Pam is donating the maximum number of books, we have found the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books. \n\nThe scholar names in order, including Amir, are: Amir, Puja, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
