Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Check if Amir is connected to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max). If yes, go to step 8.\n4. If not, check each person Amir is connected to: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n5. Add each of these connections to the current path.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each person in the current path until the maximum number of books donor (Max) is found.\n7. Once Max is found, go to step 9.\n8. If Max is not found, repeat steps 3-7 for each person in the current path until Max is found.\n9.
