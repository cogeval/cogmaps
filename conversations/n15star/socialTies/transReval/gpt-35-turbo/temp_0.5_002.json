Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, the connected scholars are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. None of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books, so we will explore their connections.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n4. Moin is not donating any books, so we will explore Pari's connections.\n5. Pari is not donating any books, so we will explore Reza's connections.\n6. Reza is not connected to anyone else, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n7. Moin is not connected to anyone else, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n8. Puja is connected to Kim and Pam.\n9. Kim is not donating the maximum number of books, so we will explore Pam's connections.\n10. Pam is connected to Kim, who is not donating the maximum number of books.\n11. None of the connected scholars of Puja are donating the maximum number of books, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n12. None of the connected scholars of Amir are donating the maximum number of books, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the scholars connected to Amir and none of them are donating the maximum number of books. Therefore, we need to explore the connections of the scholars connected to the scholars connected to Amir.\n\n1. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n2. Moin is not donating any books, so we will explore Pari's connections.\n3. Pari is not donating any books, so we will explore Reza's connections.\n4. Reza is not connected to anyone else, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n5. None of the connected scholars of Reza are donating the maximum number of books, so we will move on to the next connected scholar.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the scholars connected to the scholars connected to Amir and none of them are donating the maximum number of books. Therefore, we need to explore the connections of the scholars connected to the scholars connected to the scholars connected to Amir.\n\n1. Moin is not connected to anyone else.\n\nSince we have explored all the possible paths and none of the scholars are donating the maximum number of books, we can conclude that there is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books."
