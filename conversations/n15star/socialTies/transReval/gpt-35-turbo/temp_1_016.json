We will keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar, and also the path taken to reach each scholar.\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir as the current scholar, initialize the distance from Amir to 0, and add Amir to the queue.\n  - Queue: Amir\n  - Distance: Amir -> 0\n  - Path: Amir -> Amir\n\nStep 2: Pop Amir from the queue and check its connections.\n  - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n  - Update the distance and path for each connected scholar:\n    - Reza: Distance: Amir -> Reza = 1, Path: Amir -> Reza\n    - Moin: Distance: Amir -> Moin = 1, Path: Amir -> Moin\n    - Pari: Distance: Amir -> Pari = 1, Path: Amir -> Pari\n    - Puja: Distance: Amir -> Puja = 1, Path: Amir -> Puja\n  - Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue.\n  - Queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\nStep 3: Continue the breadth-first search until we find the person donating the maximum number of books.\n  - Pop the next scholar from the queue (Reza).\n  - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n  - Update the distance and path for each connected scholar:\n    - Moin: Distance: Amir -> Reza -> Moin = 2, Path: Amir -> Reza -> Moin\n    - Pari: Distance: Amir -> Reza -> Pari = 2, Path: Amir -> Reza -> Pari\n  - Add Moin and Pari to the queue.\n  - Queue: Moin, Pari\n\n  - Pop the next scholar from the queue (Moin).\n  - Moin is connected to Pari.\n  - Update the distance and path for the connected scholar (Pari):\n    - Pari: Distance: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari = 3, Path: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari\n  - Add Pari to the queue.\n  - Queue: Pari\n\n  - Pop the next scholar from the queue (Pari).\n  - Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n  - No further update in distance or path.\n  - Queue: Empty\n\nStep 4: Since the queue is empty, we have found the shortest path from Amir to all reachable scholars.\n  - The scholar who is donating the maximum number of books is Max, connected through Jing.\n  - The shortest path from Amir to Max is: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Jing -> Max\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing, Max"
