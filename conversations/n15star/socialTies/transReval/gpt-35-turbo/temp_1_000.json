Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n\n5. Start by adding Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the front scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar is donating books. If yes, update the maximum donation count and the scholar with maximum donation.\n   - Iterate through the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited, add them to the queue, mark them as visited, and update their book donation count.\n   - Repeat until the queue is empty.\n\n7. Once the algorithm finishes, the scholar with the maximum donation will be the person we are looking for.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin, Max"
