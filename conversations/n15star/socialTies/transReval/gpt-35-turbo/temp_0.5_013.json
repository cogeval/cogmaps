Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Create a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated and initialize it to 0.\n6. Create a variable to store the name of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and initialize it to an empty string.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   a.
