Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node and set the distance from Amir to 0.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   4. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   5. Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, store the number of books and the scholar's name.\n   6. If the current scholar is not donating the maximum number of books encountered so far, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   7. Update the distance of the connected scholars by adding 1 to the distance of the current scholar.\n8. Finally, return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
