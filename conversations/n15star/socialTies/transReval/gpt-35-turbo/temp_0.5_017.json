Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books.\n3. If yes, add those scholars to a queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each scholar in the queue until the queue is empty.\n5. Once the queue is empty, we have explored all possible paths from Amir to the scholars donating books.\n6. Now, we need to find the shortest path among those paths.\n7. Start with the scholars who are donating the maximum number of books and backtrack to Amir, keeping track of the path.\n8. Return the path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"
