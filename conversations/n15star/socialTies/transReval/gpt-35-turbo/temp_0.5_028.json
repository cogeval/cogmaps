Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Set the shortest path from Amir to Amir as [Amir].\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and update their shortest path using the shortest path of the previous scholar plus the current scholar's name.\n   - Check if the current scholar is donating books. If they are, store their name and the number of books they are donating.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited.\n6.
