Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar one by one until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Reza: Moin, Pari.\n   - For Moin: Pari.\n   - For Pari: No further connections.\n   - For Puja: Pam.\n4. Check the connections of each of the scholars we have reached so far:\n   - For Reza: Moin, Pari.\n   - For Moin: Pari.\n   - For Pari: No further connections.\n   - For Puja: Pam.\n   - For Pam: No further connections.\n5. Among the scholars we have reached, find the person who is donating the maximum number of books. In this case, it is Pam who is donating 50 books.\n6. The shortest path from Amir to Pam is: Amir, Puja, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
