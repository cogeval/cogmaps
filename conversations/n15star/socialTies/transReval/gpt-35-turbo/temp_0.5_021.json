Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each connected scholar one by one until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if any of the connected scholars are donating the maximum number of books (50). If yes, we have found the shortest path. Answer: Amir, Kim.\n3. If none of the connected scholars are donating the maximum number of books, move to the next level of connections.\n4. From Amir, we have Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja as connected scholars. Explore each of them.\n5. Check if any of Reza's connections are donating the maximum number of books. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Answer: Amir, Reza, Kim.\n6. If not, move to Moin, Pari, and Puja one by one.\n7. None of Moin's connections are donating the maximum number of books.\n8. None of Pari's connections are donating the maximum number of books.\n9. Check Puja's connections.\n10. Puja is connected to Pam, who is not donating the maximum number of books.\n11. Move to the next level of connections.\n12. From Reza, we have Moin and Pari as connected scholars. Explore each of them.\n13. None of Moin's connections are donating the maximum number of books.\n14. None of Pari's connections are donating the maximum number of books.\n15. Move to the next level of connections.\n16. From Moin, we have Pari as the only connected scholar. Explore Pari.\n17. Pari is not connected to anyone donating the maximum number of books.\n18. Move to the next level of connections.\n19. From Puja, we have Pam as the only connected scholar. Explore Pam.\n20. Pam is not donating the maximum number of books.\n21. We have explored all possible connections from Amir and none of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n22. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is Answer: Amir, Kim."
