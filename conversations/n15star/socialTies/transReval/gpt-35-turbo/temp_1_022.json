We will keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar, as well as the maximum number of books donated by each scholar.\n\nStarting with Amir, we initialize the distance and maximum books donated for all scholars as infinity, except for Amir, whose distance is 0 and maximum books donated is also 0. We also initialize an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n\nWe will iterate until the queue is empty. At each iteration, we dequeue a scholar, check their connections, and update the distance and maximum books donated for their connected scholars. If the connected scholar has not been visited before, we enqueue them.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance and maximum books donated for all scholars as infinity, except for Amir, whose distance is 0 and maximum books donated is also 0.\n   - Distance: Amir(0), Reza(inf), Moin(inf), Pari(inf), Puja(inf), Wim(inf), Wei(inf), Kim(inf), Pam(inf), Raj(inf), Nisha(inf), Ian(inf), Sara(inf), Jing(inf), Max(inf)\n   - Maximum books donated: Amir(0), Reza(0), Moin(0), Pari(0), Puja(0), Wim(0), Wei(0), Kim(0), Pam(0), Raj(0), Nisha(0), Ian(0), Sara(0), Jing(0), Max(0)\n\n2. Initialize an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n   - Queue: Amir\n\n3. Start the iteration:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n   - Check the connections of Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n   - Update the distance and maximum books donated for each connected scholar:\n     - Reza: distance = 1, maximum books donated = 0\n     - Moin: distance = 1, maximum books donated = 0\n     - Pari: distance = 1, maximum books donated = 0\n     - Puja: distance = 1, maximum books donated = 0\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja) into the queue.\n   - Queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\n4. Continue the iteration:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue (Reza).\n   - Check the connections of Reza: Moin, Pari.\n   - Update the distance and maximum books donated for each connected scholar:\n     - Moin: distance = 2, maximum books donated = 0\n     - Pari: distance = 2, maximum books donated = 0\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars (Moin, Pari) into the queue.\n   - Queue: Moin, Pari, Moin, Pari\n\n5. Continue the iteration:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue (Moin).\n   - Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n   - Update the distance and maximum books donated for the connected scholar:\n     - Pari: distance = 3, maximum books donated = 0\n   - Enqueue the connected scholar (Pari) into the queue.\n   - Queue: Pari, Pari\n\n6. Continue the iteration:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue (Pari).\n   - Check the connections of Pari: None (already visited).\n   - Queue: Pari\n\n7. Continue the iteration:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue (Pari).\n   - Since the queue is now empty, we stop the iteration.\n\nNow, we can see the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books. The scholar with the maximum books donated is Max.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Max is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
