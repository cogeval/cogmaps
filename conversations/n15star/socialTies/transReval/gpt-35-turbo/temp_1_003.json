Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We start by considering Amir as the starting point and check the connections of Amir's connections. We continue this process until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars' names and create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: {}\n\n2. Pop the first scholar, Amir, from the queue and mark him as visited.\n   Queue: []\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n3. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Add them to the queue if they haven't been visited before.\n   Queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, Reza, and mark him as visited.\n   Queue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir, Reza}\n\n5. Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari. Add them to the queue if they haven't been visited before.\n   Queue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir, Reza}\n\n6. Take the first scholar from the queue, Moin, and mark him as visited.\n   Queue: [Pari, Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin}\n\n7. Check Moin's connections: Pari. Add her to the queue if she hasn't been visited before.\n   Queue: [Pari, Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin}\n\n8. Take the first scholar from the queue, Pari, and mark her as visited.\n   Queue: [Puja]\n   Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari}\n\n9. Check Pari's connections: None.\n\n10. Take the next scholar from the queue, Puja, and mark her as visited.\n    Queue: []\n    Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n11. Check Puja's connections: None.\n\nSince there are no remaining scholars in the queue, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja"
