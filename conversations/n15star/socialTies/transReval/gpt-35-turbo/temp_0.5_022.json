Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and add Amir to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Remove the first person from the queue.\n   b. Check if the person is donating books. If yes, record the number of books and the person's name.\n   c. Check all the connections of the current person.\n   d. If a connected person has not been visited, mark them as visited, add them to the queue, and record the path from Amir to that person.\n4. Repeat steps 3 until the queue is empty.\n5. Finally, return the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
