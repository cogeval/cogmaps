Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Dequeue the first person from the queue and assign it to the current node.\n   b. Check if the current node is donating books. If yes, go to step 4.\n   c. If the current node is not donating books, enqueue all the people connected to the current node who have not been visited yet.\n4. The current node is the person donating the maximum number of books. Return the path from Amir to the current node.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2.
