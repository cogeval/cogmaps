Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the shortest path to each scholar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books_donated to 0 and a variable shortest_path to an empty list.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has donated more books than max_books_donated. If so, update max_books_donated and shortest_path.\n   c. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   d. Mark the connected scholars as visited.\n   e. Update the shortest path to each connected scholar by adding the current scholar to their shortest path.\n5. Return the shortest path.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Max"
