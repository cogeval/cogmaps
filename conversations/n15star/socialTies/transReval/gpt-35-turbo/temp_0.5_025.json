Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin's connections: Pari.\n   - Pari's connections: None.\n   - Puja's connections: Pam.\n4. Check the connections of each of the connections explored in step 3.\n   - Moin's connections: Pari.\n   - Pari's connections: None.\n   - Pam's connections: None.\n5. Since Pari is the person who is donating the maximum number of books, we stop the search.\n6. The shortest path from Amir to Pari is: Amir, Reza, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari"
