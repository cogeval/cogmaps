Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. If not, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any other scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2.
