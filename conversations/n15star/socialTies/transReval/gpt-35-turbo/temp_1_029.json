Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Since Kim is donating more books, we will find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Kim, considering the connections, is as follows:\nAmir - Reza - Moin - Pari - Puja - Kim\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order, starting from Amir and ending with Kim, separated by commas, are:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Kim"

Also, Jing is now connected to Puja instead of Max.\n\nThe new connections from Amir are as follows:\n\nAmir - Sara - Ian - Nisha - Max\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books, we need to determine the person donating the maximum number of books.
