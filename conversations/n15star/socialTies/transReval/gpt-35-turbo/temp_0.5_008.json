Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the initial node and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If so, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n5. If we have not found the shortest path, it means there is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Max"
