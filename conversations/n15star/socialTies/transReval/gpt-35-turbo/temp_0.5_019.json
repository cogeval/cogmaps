Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will continue exploring the scholars connected to the current scholar until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books, or until we have explored all possible paths.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Explore Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Explore Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n4. Explore Moin's connections: Pari.\n5. Explore Pari's connections: No further connections.\n6. Explore Puja's connections: Pam.\n7. Explore Pam's connections: No further connections.\n8. Since Pam is donating the maximum number of books, we have found the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
