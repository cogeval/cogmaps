We'll repeat this process for each subsequent scholar until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's start the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Among the connected scholars, we don't know who is donating the maximum number of books yet. So, we need to explore each connected scholar's connections.\n4. Explore Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n5. Explore Moin's connections: Pari.\n6. Explore Pari's connections: No further connections.\n7. Explore Puja's connections: Pam.\n8. Explore Pam's connections: No further connections.\n9. Now, we have explored all the scholars connected to Amir. We need to move to the next level of connected scholars.\n10. Among Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, we don't know who is donating the maximum number of books yet. So, we need to explore each connected scholar's connections.\n11. Explore Moin's connections: Pari.\n12. Explore Pari's connections: No further connections.\n13. Explore Puja's connections: Pam.\n14. Explore Pam's connections: No further connections.\n15.

Explore Pari's connections: No further connections.\n18. Explore Moin's connections: Pari.\n19. Explore Pari's connections: No further connections.\n20. Now, we have explored all the scholars connected to Moin and Pari. We need to move to the next level of connected scholars.\n21. Among Pari, we don't know who is donating the maximum number of books yet. So, we need to explore Pari's connections.\n22. Pari doesn't have any further connections.\n23. Now, we have explored all the scholars connected to Pari. We need to move to the next level of connected scholars.\n24. Among Puja, we don't know who is donating the maximum number of books yet. So, we need to explore Puja's connections.\n25. Explore Pam's connections: No further connections.\n26. Now, we have explored all the scholars connected to Puja. We need to move to the next level of connected scholars.\n27. Among Pam, we don't know who is donating the maximum number of books yet. So, we need to explore Pam's connections.\n28. Pam doesn't have any further connections.\n29. Now, we have explored all the scholars connected to Pam. We have finished exploring all the scholars.\n\nNow, we can determine the path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
