Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is donating books. If yes, go to step 6.\n3. If Amir is not connected to any scholar who is donating books, check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar donating books. If yes, go to step 6.\n4. If Amir is not connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar donating books, repeat step 3 for each scholar connected to Amir until a connection to a scholar donating books is found.\n5. If no connection to a scholar donating books is found, the path ends here. Answer: Amir.\n6. If a connection to a scholar donating books is found, add that scholar to the path and repeat steps 2-6 for the newly added scholar until a scholar donating the maximum number of books is reached.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\nStarting from Amir, we check if Amir is connected to any scholar donating books. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, but none of them are donating books.\n\nNext, we check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar donating books. Amir is connected to Reza, who is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is not donating books, but Pari is connected to Puja, who is donating books.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Answer: Amir, Pari, Puja."
