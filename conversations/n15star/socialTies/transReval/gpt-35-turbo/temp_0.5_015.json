Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who have not been visited yet. Add them to the visited set and update their path.\n4. If no path to the person donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue and visited set.\n   - Queue: [Amir]\n   - Visited set: {Amir}\n   - Path: {Amir: [Amir]}\n\n2. Dequeue Amir from the queue.\n   - Current scholar: Amir\n\n3. Check if Amir is donating the maximum number of books. No.\n\n4. Enqueue the connected scholars of Amir who have not been visited yet.\n   - Connected scholars: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n   - Enqueue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   - Update their path: {Reza: [Amir, Reza], Moin: [Amir, Moin], Pari: [Amir, Pari], Puja: [Amir, Puja]}\n   - Visited set: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n5. Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n   - Current scholar: Reza\n\n6. Check if Reza is donating the maximum number of books. No.\n\n7. Enqueue the connected scholars of Reza who have not been visited yet.\n   - Connected scholars: Moin, Pari\n   - Enqueue: [Moin, Pari]\n   - Update their path: {Moin: [Amir, Reza, Moin], Pari: [Amir, Reza, Pari]}\n   - Visited set: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n8. Dequeue Moin from the queue.\n   - Current scholar: Moin\n\n9. Check if Moin is donating the maximum number of books. No.\n\n10. Enqueue the connected scholars of Moin who have not been visited yet.\n    - Connected scholars: Pari\n    - Enqueue: [Pari]\n    - Update their path: {Pari: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari]}\n    - Visited set: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n11. Dequeue Pari from the queue.\n    - Current scholar: Pari\n\n12. Check if Pari is donating the maximum number of books. No.\n\n13. Enqueue the connected scholars of Pari who have not been visited yet.\n    - Connected scholars: None\n\n14. The queue is empty and no path to the person donating the maximum number of books is found. Return \"No path found.\"\n\nAnswer: No path found."
