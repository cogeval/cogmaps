Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create a dictionary to keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar, initialized with a distance of 0 for Amir.\n4. Create a dictionary to keep track of the path from Amir to each scholar, initialized with Amir as the path for Amir.\n5. Create a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated, initially set to 0.\n6. Create a variable to keep track of the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, initially set to None.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books and if the number of books is greater than the current maximum.\n   - If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar donating the maximum.\n   - For each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited:\n       - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n       - Enqueue the scholar.\n       - Update the distance and path dictionaries.\n8.
