Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Create a graph representing the connections between the scholars.\n2. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n3. Initialize a visited set and add Amir to it.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar to Amir.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path from Amir to the scholar.\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n      i. Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n      ii. Add the neighbor to the queue.\n      iii. Update the path dictionary to include the neighbor's path.\n6. If the search completes without finding the scholar donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow let's implement these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
