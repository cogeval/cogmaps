Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will continue this process until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books with a value of 0 and a variable max_books_scholar with a value of None.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than max_books, update max_books with the number of books donated by the scholar and update max_books_scholar with the name of the scholar.\n   - For each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n5. Return the path from Amir to max_books_scholar.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
