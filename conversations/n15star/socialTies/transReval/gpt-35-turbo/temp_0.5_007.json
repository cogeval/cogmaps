Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, or Puja.\n3. If yes, add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue.\n4. Check if any of the scholars in the queue are connected to the person donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max).\n5. If yes, return the path from Amir to that scholar.\n6. If not, continue to the next level of connections by dequeueing the next scholar from the queue and repeating steps 2-5 until the queue is empty.\n\nLet's follow this process step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Add them to the queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n3. Check Reza. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Add them to the queue: Moin, Pari, Puja.\n4. Check Moin. Moin is connected to Pari. Add Pari to the queue: Pari, Puja.\n5. Check Pari. Pari is not connected to Kim or Max.\n6. Check Puja. Puja is connected to Kim and Pam. Add Kim and Pam to the queue: Kim, Pam.\n7. Check Kim. Kim is connected to Pam. Kim is not connected to Max.\n8. Check Pam. Pam is not connected to Kim or Max.\n9. The queue is empty. There are no more connections to check.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max) is: Amir, Puja, Kim, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim, Max"
