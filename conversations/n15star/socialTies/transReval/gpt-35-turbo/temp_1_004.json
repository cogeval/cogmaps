Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is not donating any books, so we skip him. Pari is not donating any books either, so we skip her.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam. Kim and Wei are also connected to Puja. None of them are donating more books than Max, so we skip them.\n6. We have explored all the connections of Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. The shortest path to the person donating the maximum number of books is Amir -> Puja -> Pam -> Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Max"
