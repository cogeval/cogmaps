Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

So, Kim is the person who donates the most books.\n\nNext, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Puja. Puja is directly connected to Kim. \n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

The person donating the most books is still Kim as they are donating 50 books.\n\nNext, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim.\n\nBecause of the recent changes, Amir is now connected to Sara instead of Puja and Jing is now connected to Puja instead of Max.\n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Sara, and Sara is directly connected to Max, but not to Kim. So, we must find a different path.\n\nWim is connected to Kim, and Wim is connected to Wei. Wei is also connected to Kim directly. On the other hand, Jing who is connected to Puja and Puja is connected to Kim, but we do not have a connection from Amir to Jing.\n\nHowever, Wim can be accessed via Raj, because Raj is connected to Kim, and Raj can be reached via Sara. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is now through Sara, Raj and Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Raj, Wim, Kim"
