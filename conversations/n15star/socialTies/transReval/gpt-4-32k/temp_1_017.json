Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are all connected to each other. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Assume now that Vivian and Pierre are connected. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

The connection path would be: Vivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Ajit -> Pierre.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Ajit, Pierre"
