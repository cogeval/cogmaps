Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I will check if Kim (who has the maximum books) is directly connected to any of these four scholars. \nKim is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Wei, and Pam. None of these four is directly connected to Amir.\n\nSecond, I will check the connections of those who are directly connected to Kim (Wim, Raj, Wei, and Pam) and see if any of them are directly connected to Amir's direct connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja). \nWei is directly connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Amir. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir - Puja - Wei - Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wei, Kim"
