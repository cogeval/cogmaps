Connect Vivian and Pierre:\n- Vivian is in Group 1\n- Pierre is in Group 3\n\n3. Determine the path that connects the most students:\n- Start with Vivian (Group 1)\n- Connect to Pierre (Group 3)\n- Connect to Soheil (Group 2)\n- Connect to Gongxue (Group 5)\n- Connect to Alice (Group 11)\n\n4. List the student names in order:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice"
