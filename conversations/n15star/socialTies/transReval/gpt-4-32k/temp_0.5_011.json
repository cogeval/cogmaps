Let's analyze the connections step by step:\n\n1. Start with Vivian, who is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n2. From Salma, we can reach Shanshan, Vadim, and Noah.\n3. From Shanshan, we can reach Salma, Vadim, and Noah.\n4. From Vadim, we can reach Salma, Shanshan, and Noah.\n5. From Gongxue, we can reach Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n\nNow let's analyze the connections from the students reached in step 2:\n\n6. From Noah, we can reach Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha.\n7. From Paul, we can reach Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice.\n8. From Solomon, we can reach Paul, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice.\n9. From Soheil, we can reach Paul, Solomon, Gongxue, Alice, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n10. From Alice, we can reach Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Gongxue.\n\nFinally, let's analyze the connections from the students reached in step 3:\n\n11. From Pierre, we can reach Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n12. From Abdul, we can reach Pierre, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha.\n13. From Durga, we can reach Pierre, Abdul, Ajit, and Anisha.\n14. From Ajit, we can reach Pierre, Abdul, Durga, and Anisha.\n15. From Anisha, we can reach Noah, Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n\nConsidering all the connections, we can find the path that connects the largest number of unique students:\n\nVivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil -> Pierre -> Abdul -> Anisha -> Noah -> Salma\n\nThis path connects 8 unique students. So the connection path that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Pierre, Abdul, Anisha, Noah, Salma"
