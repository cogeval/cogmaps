Identify the groups of connected students:\n   - Group 1: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n   - Group 2: Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 3: Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n   - Group 4: Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n   - Group 5: Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 6: Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Group 7: Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Group 8: Soheil, Alice\n   - Group 9: Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Group 10: Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Group 11: Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 12: Ajit, Anisha\n\n2. Identify the connections between the groups:\n   - Vivian is connected to Pierre (Group 1 to Group 3)\n   - Gongxue is connected to Alice (Group 1 to Group 2)\n   - Soheil is connected to Alice (Group 2 to Group 8)\n   - Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other (Group 3 to Group 6)\n\n3. Determine the path that involves the most connections:\n   - Vivian (Group 1) -> Pierre (Group 3) -> Abdul/Durga/Ajit (Group 6) -> Anisha (Group 12)\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Abdul, Anisha"
