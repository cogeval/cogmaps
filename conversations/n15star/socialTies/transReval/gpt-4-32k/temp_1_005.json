Here's a step by step analysis of the connections:\n\n1. Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue. \n2. Pierre is connected to Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil.\n3. Vivian and Pierre are now connected, so we need to evaluate their respective connections.\n\nGroup 1 (Vivian's connections):\n- Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n- Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha (connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim)\n- Shanshan, Vadim (connected to Salma)\n- Total connections in this group: 11\n\nGroup 2 (Pierre's connections):\n- Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n- Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice (connected to Soheil and Gongxue)\n- Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice (connected to Soheil and Gongxue)\n- Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha (connected to Abdul, Durga, and Ajit)\n- Durga, Ajit, Anisha (connected to Abdul)\n- Total connections in this group: 14\n\nAs Group 2 has more connections, the path that yields the most reward from Vivian is: Vivian, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil, Paul, Solomon, Gongxue, Alice, Anisha\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil, Paul, Solomon, Gongxue, Alice, Anisha"
