Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Assume now that Vivian and Pierre are connected. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Gongxue has Soheil as a common connection with Pierre.\n\nStep 6: Determine the most rewarding path.\nThe paths with the most connections are those including Noah or Anisha, as they connect Vivian to a larger group of students (Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha or Abdul, Durga, Ajit).\n\nStep 7: Choose one of the paths with the most connections.\nFor example, the path with Anisha:\nVivian, Salma, Anisha, Abdul, Pierre\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha, Abdul, Pierre"
