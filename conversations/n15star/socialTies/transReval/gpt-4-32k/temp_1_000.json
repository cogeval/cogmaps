Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

In this case, that is Kim, who is donating 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationships that Amir has with other scholars. According to the information provided, Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Check if any of these scholars is directly connected to Kim. From the given information, none of them is.\n\nStep 4: Check the scholars to whom Amir is connected, and see who they are connected to. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari; Moin is connected to Pari; Pari does not have any further connections; Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nStep 5: The only connection that leads to a scholar who has a direct connection with Kim is through Puja, who is connected to Pam, and Pam is directly connected to Kim.\n\nStep 6: The shortest path to the scholar who is donating the maximum books (Kim) from Amir is, therefore, Amir - Puja - Pam - Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"

In this case, it's still Kim, who is donating 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Determine the new relationships that Amir has with other scholars. According to the updated information, Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and now Sara.\n\nStep 3: Check if any of these scholars is directly connected to Kim. From the given information, none of them is.\n\nStep 4: Check the scholars to whom Amir is connected, and see who they are connected to. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari; Moin is connected to Pari; Pari does not have any further connections; Sara is connected to Ian and Max. \n\nStep 5: One of the people Sara is connected to, Ian, is connected directly to Max. However, Max is not donating as many books as Kim.\n\nStep 6: To reach Kim, we have to consider other paths. Reza, one of the scholars Amir is connected to, is also connected to Moin, and Moin is connected to Pari. None of these scholars are directly connected to Kim, which means we can't reach Kim this way.\n\nStep 7: Jing, who used to be connected to Max, is now connected to Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, who is connected to Kim. However, this path is not accessible from Amir's connections.\n\nStep 8: The path to reach Kim from Amir, with the updated connections, is no longer clear and might not be possible, given the current connections.\n\nAnswer: No direct path to Kim from Amir with current connections"
