Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

In this case, it's Kim who is donating 50 books. \n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Among them, Puja is connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and now Sara instead of Puja.\n3. Among these, Sara is connected to Max, but Max is not connected to Kim.\n4. So, we need to find another path. Reza is connected to Moin, and Moin is connected to Pari. Unfortunately, none of these scholars are connected to Kim.\n5. Therefore, we need to find another path. We know that Wim is connected to Kim. \n6. To reach Wim, we can go through Puja.\n7. But, Amir is no longer directly connected to Puja. However, Amir is connected to Sara, Sara is connected to Max, and Max is connected to Jing, who is now connected to Puja.\n8. From Puja, we can reach Wim, and from Wim, we can reach Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim under the new connections is Amir, Sara, Max, Jing, Puja, Wim, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Max, Jing, Puja, Wim, Kim."
