Check Reza's connections again since we cannot reach Kim from Moin or Pari: no new connections\n10. No scholars connected directly to Amir lead to Kim.

The shortest path to the person donating the maximum number of books (Kim) is no longer accessible from Amir due to the broken connection with Puja. The available donor now is Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Max."
