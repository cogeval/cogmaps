Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

So, Kim is the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's identify the shortest path from Amir to Kim:\n1. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n2. From this list, only Puja is directly connected to Kim. \n3. So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is via Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

Amir is now connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Sara (not Puja anymore).\n2. Out of these, Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, Moin is connected to Pari, and Sara is connected to Max, but none of them are directly connected to Kim.\n3. Since Sara is connected to Max, and Max is directly connected to Ian, we consider the next step through Sara.\n4. Ian is directly connected to Kim.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Kim, following the new connections is Amir -> Sara -> Ian -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Ian, Kim"
