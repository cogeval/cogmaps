Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

The person donating the maximum number of books is still Kim. \n\nStarting from Amir, we know that Amir is connected to Sara. Sara is connected to Max. However, there is no path from Max to Kim. \n\nIf we look at another path from Amir, we can go to Moin. Moin is connected to Pari. Pari is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Moin. But this doesn't lead to Kim either. \n\nAmir can't connect directly to Kim anymore, so we must find an intermediary. Looking at the connections, Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. And, Raj is also connected to Kim. But Amir doesn't have a direct connection to Wim or Raj.\n\nHowever, if we go through Sara from Amir, we then have a connection to Ian and Ian is connected to Sara who is connected to Max. But that still doesn't lead to Kim.\n\nWe need to find a path to Wei, who is connected to Kim. Looking at the connections, Wim connects to Wei, but none of Amir's connections are to Wim. \n\nSince none of the paths through Amir's connections lead to Kim, it seems there is no possible route to Kim from Amir after the argument with Puja and the subsequent reconnections.\n\nAnswer: No possible path."
