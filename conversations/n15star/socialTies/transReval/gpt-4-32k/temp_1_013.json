Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Assume now that Vivian and Pierre are connected. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Considering the new connection with Pierre, we need to check if any of these paths have a connection with Pierre:\n\nPath 1: Vivian \u2192 Salma \u2192 Noah, Anisha (No connection with Pierre)\nPath 3: Vivian \u2192 Vadim \u2192 Noah, Anisha (No connection with Pierre)\nPath 4: Vivian \u2192 Gongxue \u2192 Alice, Paul, Solomon, Soheil (No connection with Pierre)\n\nHowever, since none of these paths have a direct connection with Pierre, we can choose any of them as the path with the most reward.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Noah, Anisha"
