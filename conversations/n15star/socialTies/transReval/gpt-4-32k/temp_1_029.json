Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha\n7. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim\n8. Soheil and Alice\n9. Durga, Ajit, and Anisha\n10. Shanshan and Vadim\n11. Gongxue and Alice\n12. Ajit and Anisha\n\nVivian and Pierre are now connected, which adds a new connection:\n13. Vivian and Pierre\n\nTo find the most rewarding connection path starting from Vivian, we can analyze the groups:\n\n- Starting with Group 1, Vivian is directly connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n- Vivian can connect to Pierre via their new connection. From Pierre (Group 3), Vivian can connect to Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil.\n- From Soheil (Group 2 and 8), Vivian can connect to Paul, Solomon, Gongxue (already connected), and Alice.\n- Gongxue and Alice (Group 5) are connected to Solomon and Soheil, but Vivian is already connected to them.\n- From Alice (Group 11), Vivian can connect to Gongxue, but she is already connected to her.\n\nBased on these connections, the most rewarding connection path from Vivian is:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Soheil, Alice"
