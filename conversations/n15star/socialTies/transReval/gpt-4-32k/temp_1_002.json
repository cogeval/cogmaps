Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n7. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam.\n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n10. Moin is connected to Pari.\n11. Puja is connected to Pam.\n12. Sara is connected to Max.\n\nFrom this, the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim, who is donating 50 books), starting from Amir, is:\n\nAmir - Puja - Kim\n\nSo, the scholar names in order, starting from Amir, are Amir, Puja, and Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
