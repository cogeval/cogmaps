Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Assume now that Vivian and Pierre are connected. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward?

            "content": "First, let's list the groups of connected students and see which students overlap between groups:\n\n1. Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n2. Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n3. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n7. Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n8. Soheil, Alice\n9. Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n10. Shanshan, Vadim\n11. Gongxue, Alice\n12. Ajit, Anisha\n\nSince Vivian is connected to Pierre, we start with the connection path: Vivian -> Pierre. Now, we must find a connection path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n2. Pierre is connected to Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil.\n\nWe should try to find a student that connects both lists. We find that Gongxue and Soheil are in both lists:\n\n- Vivian -> Gongxue (from group 1)\n- Pierre -> Soheil (from group 3)\n\nNow, let's analyze the connections for Gongxue and Soheil:\n\n- Gongxue is connected to Paul, Solomon, and Alice (from group 2 and 11)\n- Soheil is connected to Solomon, Alice (from group 2 and 8)\n\nHere, both Gongxue and Soheil connect to Solomon and Alice. But choosing Gongxue adds an extra connection, which would yield a higher reward. So, let's continue with Gongxue:\n\n1. Vivian -> Gongxue\n2. Pierre -> Soheil\n\nNow, Gongxue can connect us to Solomon and Alice:\n\n- Vivian -> Gongxue -> Solomon, Alice\n\nFinally, we check the connections for Solomon and Alice:\n\n- Solomon is connected to Soheil and Alice (from group 5)\n- Alice is connected to Soheil (from group 8)\n\nSolomon has an extra connection to Alice, which would yield a higher reward. So the most rewarding path from Vivian is:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Solomon, Alice"
