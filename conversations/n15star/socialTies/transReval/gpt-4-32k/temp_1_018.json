Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Therefore, Kim is the one who is donating the most books. \n\n2. Now, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\n3. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n\n4. Among the connections of Amir, only Puja is directly connected to Kim (through Wim). \n\n5. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be Amir -> Puja -> Wim -> Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim"

Now, Amir is no longer connected to Puja, but connected to Sara instead. \n\n3. From the available connections, we see that Amir can connect to Kim through Sara -> Raj -> Kim.\n\n4. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir -> Sara -> Raj -> Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Raj, Kim"
