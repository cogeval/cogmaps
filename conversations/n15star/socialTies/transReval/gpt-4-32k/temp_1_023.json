Vivian is connected to Group 1 and, by extension, to Pierre (assumed connection). Pierre is connected to Group 3.\n2. From Group 3, Soheil is connected to Groups 2 and 5. Alice is part of both Groups 2 and 5.\n3. Anisha is connected to Ajit, and they are both part of Group 6. Anisha is also part of Group 4, which connects to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim (Group 7).\n\nBased on the connections, the most rewarding path starting from Vivian would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Soheil, Alice, Anisha"
