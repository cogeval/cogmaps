Vivian is directly connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n2. Salma is connected to Noah, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha.\n3. Shanshan is connected to Noah, Salma, Vadim, and Anisha.\n4. Vadim is connected to Noah, Salma, Shanshan, and Anisha.\n5. Gongxue is connected to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n6. Alice is connected to Solomon, Soheil, and Gongxue.\n\nThe most rewarding path from Vivian seems to be connecting to Gongxue first because Gongxue is connected to the largest different group of students. From there, we can connect to Alice, who is connected to Solomon and Soheil. After reaching Alice, we can move to Solomon and Soheil, who are both connected to Pierre. Since Pierre is our final target, the connection path would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Alice, Solomon, Pierre"
