Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are all connected to each other. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Assume now that Vivian and Pierre are connected. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue\n2. Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice\n3. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha\n7. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim\n8. Soheil and Alice\n9. Durga, Ajit, and Anisha\n10. Shanshan and Vadim\n11. Gongxue and Alice\n12. Ajit and Anisha\n\nAssuming that Vivian and Pierre are connected, we can create a connection path between them that would yield the most reward by connecting them through the groups of students they have in common. Since Vivian and Pierre do not have any groups in common, the path should connect them through groups that include other students who are part of both their groups. \n\nConsidering the students who are part of both Vivian's and Pierre's groups, we can find the following overlaps:\n\n- Gongxue appears in Vivian's group 1 and Pierre's group 3.\n- Soheil appears in Vivian's group 2 and Pierre's group 3.\n\nBy taking into account the connected groups, we can create the connection path between Vivian and Pierre that would yield the most reward:\n\nVivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue (Group 1)\nGongxue, Solomon, Soheil (Group 5)\nSoheil, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit (Group 3)\n\nSo, the connection path yielding the most reward would be:\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue, Solomon, Soheil, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit"
