Vivian -> Vadim -> (Salma, Shanshan, Noah, Anisha)\n   d. Vivian -> Gongxue -> (Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Alice)\n\n4. Identify the connection path that yields the most reward (i.e., the path that connects to the most unique students):\n\n   The path through Gongxue connects to the most unique students (7 in total).\n\n5. Continue exploring the connections from Gongxue:\n\n   a. Gongxue -> Paul -> (Solomon, Soheil, Alice)\n   b. Gongxue -> Solomon -> (Paul, Soheil, Alice)\n   c. Gongxue -> Soheil -> (Paul, Solomon, Gongxue, Alice, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit)\n   d. Gongxue -> Alice -> (Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue)\n\n6.
