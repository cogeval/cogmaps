Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Check the persons Amir is connected to: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n3. Since none of these persons is the one donating books, we'll have to trace paths from each of these.\n4. From the names Amir is connected to, Reza is connected to Moin, Pari. \n5. Moin is also directly connected to Amir and he is connected to Pari, but neither Moin nor Pari are the donors we're seeking.\n6. Pari doesn't lead to any other scholars, making her an end point.\n7. Puja is connected to Pam and Pam is connected to Kim, who is donating the maximum number of books.\n8. So the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."

From the names Amir is connected to, Reza is connected to Moin, Pari. \n5. Moin is also directly connected to Amir and he is connected to Pari, but neither Moin nor Pari are the donors we're seeking.\n6. Pari doesn't lead to any other scholars, making her an end point.\n7. Sara is connected to Max, but Max is not the one who donates the most books.\n8. Continuing from the list of scholars, Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam. But none of these are directly linked to Amir. \n9. Likewise, Raj and Nisha do not have a direct connection to Amir.\n10. However, Wei is connected to Kim who is donating the maximum number of books.\n11. Now, we need to find a path from Amir to Wei. \n12. Amir is connected to Sara and Sara is connected to Ian, and Ian is connected to Max. Max doesn't connect with Wei directly or indirectly.\n13. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. None of these connect to Wei.\n14. Amir can't reach Wei directly or indirectly, which is necessary to reach Kim. \n\nTherefore, after the changes, there is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: No path available."
