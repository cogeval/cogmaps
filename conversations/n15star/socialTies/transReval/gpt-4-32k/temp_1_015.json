The information also indicates that Puja is connected to Kim.\n4. The shortest path from Amir to Kim, therefore, is through Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

Max is not directly connected to Kim, so consider other connections.\n5. Amir is also connected to Reza and Moin.\n6. Neither Reza nor Moin have a direct connection to Kim.\n7. The other connection Sara has is Ian.\n8. From the previous information, Ian is not directly connected to Kim. \n9. Among other connections Amir has, there is no direct link to Kim. \n10. The only possible way is through Raj who is connected to Kim.  \n11. So, for Amir to reach Kim, it would be through Sara to Ian then Raj to Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Ian, Raj, Kim"
