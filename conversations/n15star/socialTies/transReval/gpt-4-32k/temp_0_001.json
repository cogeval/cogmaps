From there, we can explore the connections in Group 3.\n\nStep 3: Identify the most rewarding connection path.\nTo find the most rewarding connection path, we need to consider the number of connections and the students involved. The more connections and students, the more rewarding the path.\n\nThe most rewarding connection path from Vivian to Pierre is:\nVivian (Group 1) -> Salma (Group 4) -> Anisha (Group 6) -> Abdul (Group 3) -> Pierre\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha, Abdul, Pierre"
