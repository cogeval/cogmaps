Start with Vivian (Group 1).\n2. Connect to Group 3 (Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil) through Pierre.\n3. Connect to Group 6 (Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha) through Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n4. Connect to Group 4 (Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha) through Anisha.\n\nThe most rewarding connection path from Vivian is:\nAnswer: Vivian, Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha, Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim"
