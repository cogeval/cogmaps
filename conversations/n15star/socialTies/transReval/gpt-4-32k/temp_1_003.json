Noah has the most connections with different students, so pick Noah.\n5. From Noah, we can connect to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha.\n6. We already connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim, so connect to Anisha.\n7. From Anisha, we can connect to Noah, Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n8. We already connected to Noah, so we can connect to Abdul, Durga, or Ajit.\n9. Check connections:\n   a. Abdul connects to Pierre, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha.\n   b. Durga connects to Pierre, Abdul, Ajit, and Anisha.\n   c. Ajit connects to Abdul, Durga, and Anisha.\n10. Abdul and Durga both have a connection with Pierre, our final target, so either of them can be picked. For this example, we'll choose Abdul.\n11.
