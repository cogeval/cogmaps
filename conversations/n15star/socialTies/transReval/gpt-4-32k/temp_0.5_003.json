But neither Ian nor Sara lead to Kim.\n\nSo, the third-degree connections from Amir also do not lead to Kim.\n\nLet's look at the fourth-degree connections:\n\nSara is connected to Max, Max is connected to Ian, and Ian is connected to Sara and Nisha. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max, but none of them lead to Kim.\n\nSo, the fourth-degree connections from Amir also do not lead to Kim.\n\nFinally, let's look at the fifth-degree connections:\n\nSara is connected to Max, Max is connected to Ian, Ian is connected to Sara and Nisha, Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max, and Max is connected to Sara. Sara is connected to Max and Ian. Ian is connected to Sara, Nisha, and Raj. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, considering the new connections, is: Amir, Sara, Max, Ian, Raj, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Max, Ian, Raj, Kim"
