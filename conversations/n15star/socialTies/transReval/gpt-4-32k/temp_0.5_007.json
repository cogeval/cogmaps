Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

In this case, it is Kim with 50 books. \n\nNext, I would look at the connections starting from Amir. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nFrom there, I would look at who Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja are connected to. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, Moin is connected to Pari, and Puja is connected to Pam. None of these connections lead to Kim.\n\nThen, I would look at the connections of the people Amir is connected to. None of them are directly connected to Kim.\n\nHowever, Kim is directly connected to Wim and Wei, and Pam. \n\nI would then look at who is connected to Wim, Wei, and Pam. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Pam is connected to Kim and Puja. \n\nFrom this, I can see that the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja and Pam. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
