Let's analyze the connections:\n\n1. Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue are connected.\n2. Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected.\n3. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are connected.\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected.\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected.\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected.\n7. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected.\n8. Soheil is connected to Alice.\n9. Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected.\n10. Shanshan is connected to Vadim.\n11. Gongxue is connected to Alice.\n12. Ajit is connected to Anisha.\n\nNow that Vivian is connected to Pierre, we can find the path that connects Vivian to the most students:\n\nVivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil -> Pierre\n\nThis path connects Vivian to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue, Alice, Soheil, and Pierre.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue, Alice, Soheil, Pierre"
