In this case, Kim is donating 50 books which is the maximum.\n\nStep 2: Find out who is directly connected to Amir.

Kim is not directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 4: Identify the connections of the people connected to Amir. \n    - Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. \n    - Moin is connected to Pari. \n    - Pari has no more connections.\n    - Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nStep 5: Check if Kim is one of the people connected to those who are directly connected to Amir. Kim is not directly connected to any of these people.\n\nStep 6: Move one step further and check the connections of the people who are connected to the ones directly connected to Amir.\n    - Pam is connected to Kim. \n\nStep 7: Found that Kim is connected to Pam. \n\nStep 8: Map the shortest path from Amir to Kim.

Kim is still donating 50 books which is the maximum.\n\nStep 2: Identify who is directly connected to Amir after the change. Amir is now connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Sara.\n\nStep 3: Check if Kim is one of the people directly connected to Amir. Kim is not directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 4: Identify the connections of the people now connected to Amir. \n    - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. \n    - Moin is connected to Pari. \n    - Pari has no more connections.\n    - Sara is connected to Max and Ian.\n\nStep 5: Check if Kim is one of the people connected to those who are directly connected to Amir. Kim is not directly connected to any of these people.\n\nStep 6: Move one step further and check the connections of the people who are connected to the ones directly connected to Amir.\n    - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n    - Max has no more connections. \n\nStep 7: As there is no direct or indirect connection found between Amir and Kim within 2 steps, move another step further. \n\nStep 8: Identify the connections of the people who are connected to the ones directly connected to Ian.\n    - Sara is connected to Ian and Max. \n\nStep 9: Again, there is no connection to Kim. Hence, repeat the process with the connections of Reza and Moin.\n    - Moin is connected to Pari. \n    - Pari has no more connections.\n\nStep 10: Again, no connection found to Kim. Hence, check the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Puja.\n    - Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. \n\nStep 11: Found that Kim is connected to Wim. \n\nStep 12: Map the shortest path from Amir to Kim considering the updated connections. The shortest path from Amir to Kim would now be through Sara, Ian, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Ian, Wim, Kim"
