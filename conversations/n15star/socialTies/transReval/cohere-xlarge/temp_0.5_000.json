Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Create a graph using the given network information. Each scholar is represented by a vertex and the edges represent the connections between scholars.\n2. Initialize the distance of each vertex to 0. The distance from Amir to himself is 0.\n3. Create a priority queue to store vertices based on their distance from Amir.\n4. Select the vertex with the lowest distance and add it to the priority queue.\n5. For each vertex in the priority queue, update the distance of its adjacent vertices.\n6. If the person donating the maximum number of books is found, the algorithm stops.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the person donating the maximum number of books is found.\n\nTo list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, the following is the result:\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Sara, Max\n\nThe list may not be in order based on the actual path, but it represents the scholar names including Amir, separated by commas."
