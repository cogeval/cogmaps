That's the answer! How did it not occur? Don't scholars other \nPuja and pam are connected! If Amir selects Puja for donations all can receive one, Amir receives books but others get one too (remember the one book rule don;t think to much about) So lets work back to Amur, this has worked for step  \nOk schola are: 1.WIm:Pam:\nFrom Wik: Pam, from Rezi:Nisha:Amir; Sry I gave Ian and PJ but there are only scholars and books in our model, there is absolutely zero chance she donates Ian or james because they do;t show a direct link. Thinking carefully in this very simple network Puja connect all the people and scholars of maximum amount if booked by one can give two, thus: \n1. Amir\n2.Wim\n\nLet there he s short-\n\n "
