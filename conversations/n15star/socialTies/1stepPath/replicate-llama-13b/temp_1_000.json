Is this a syntax error or a logical error? The string that you provided only has one final output. If this is what you are asking about, how would you interpret it?\n\nComment: You are looking for a shortest path between 2 persons in a connected graph, so the first answer provided above is the result you are looking for.\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer, I got you. Yes. i'm looking for my output based on the task. How do I do it?\n\nComment: If you mean what is missing in your sample output, then you should update the question or write an answer yourself with both current output and updated output.\n\nComment: Sorry for my late response. Nowadays I am very busy studying for the exams. As I have updated my new answer to solve this puzzle.\n\nComment: Sorry to say but your sample output is still not helpful.
