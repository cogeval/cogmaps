According to the information provided, Pari is connected to Puja.\n\nNext, we need to find the scholars that are directly connected to Puja. Puja is connected to Wei and Kim.\n\nThen, we need to find the scholars that are directly connected to Kim. Kim is connected to Pam.\n\nFinally, we need to find the scholars that are directly connected to Pam. Pam is not connected to any other scholar.\n\nSince Pam is the last scholar in our path and is not connected to Jing, we cannot continue the path from Pam to Jing.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pari to Jing, including Pari, is: \nAnswer: Pari"
