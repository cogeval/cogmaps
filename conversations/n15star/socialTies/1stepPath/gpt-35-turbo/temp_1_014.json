If not, add Moin to the queue and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat the process for the newly added scholar (Moin).\n6. Check the scholars connected to Moin (Pari and Reza).\n7. Check if Reza is the target. If yes, stop and return the path (Pari, Moin, Reza).\n8. If not, check if Pari is already visited. If not, add Pari to the queue and mark it as visited.\n9.

If yes, stop and return the path (Pari, Moin, Reza).\n12.
