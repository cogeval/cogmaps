Starting from Moin, we will explore each scholar's connections and keep track of the visited scholars until we reach Reza.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Moin.\n2. Check Moin's connections: Moin is connected to Pari and Reza.\n3. Add Pari and Reza to the list of scholars to visit next.\n4. Mark Moin as visited.\n5. Move to the next scholar in the list, which is Pari.\n6. Check Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Moin and Reza.\n7. Since Moin has already been visited, we skip it.\n8. Add Reza to the list of scholars to visit next.\n9. Mark Pari as visited.\n10. Move to the next scholar in the list, which is Reza.\n11. Reza is the target scholar (Reza == Reza), so we stop here.\n\nThe shortest path from Moin to Reza is: Moin, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Reza"
