If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Wim.\n3. If Kim is not directly connected to Wim, check Kim's connections.\n4. Kim is connected to Pam. Add Pam to the queue.\n5. Check Pam's connections. Pam is connected to Wei and Puja.\n6. Add Wei and Puja to the queue.\n7. Check Wei's connections. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Since we have already visited Kim and Pam, we can skip them.\n8. Check Puja's connections. Puja is connected to Kim, Pam, and Wim. We have already visited Kim and Pam, so the shortest path is Kim, Puja, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Puja, Wim"
