Check if Reza is connected to Amir directly. If yes, then the shortest path is just Reza and Amir.\n3. If not, enqueue Reza into a queue to mark it as visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 5-8.\n5. Dequeue a scholar from the queue and check if they are connected to Amir directly. If yes, then we have found the shortest path.\n6. If not, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar (excluding the ones already visited) into the queue.\n7. Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until we find the shortest path or the queue becomes empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from Reza to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Amir"
