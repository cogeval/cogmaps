Check if Reza is connected to Pari. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Pari.\n3. If not, check the connections of Reza and add them to a queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue and check if they are connected to Pari.\n5. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, [scholar name], Pari.\n6. If not, add the connections of the scholar to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until Pari is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Reza to Pari:\n\n1. Start with Reza.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Check if Moin or Pari is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is connected to Reza, so the shortest path is Reza, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Pari"
