Create an empty queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Moin, we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, if the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If we reach this point, it means there is no path from Reza to Moin.\n\nFollowing these steps, let's find the shortest path from Reza to Moin:\n\n1. Start with Reza.\n2. Enqueue Reza.\n3. Mark Reza as visited.\n4. Enqueue Moin.\n5. Dequeue Reza.\n6. Enqueue Moin.\n7. Dequeue Moin.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin"
