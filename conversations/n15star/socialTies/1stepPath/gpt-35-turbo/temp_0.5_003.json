Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Puja, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue all its connected scholars.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Puja has not been found, there is no path from Amir to Puja.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Enqueue Amir.\n3. Mark Amir as visited.\n4. Dequeue Amir.\n5. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Mark Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja as visited.\n7. Dequeue Reza.\n8. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n9. Mark Moin and Pari as visited.\n10. Dequeue Moin.\n11. Enqueue Pari.\n12. Mark Pari as visited.\n13. Dequeue Pari.\n14. Enqueue Puja.\n15. Mark Puja as visited.\n16. Dequeue Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Puja"
