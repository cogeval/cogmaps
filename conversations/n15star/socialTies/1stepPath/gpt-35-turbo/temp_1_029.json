Kim is connected to Puja.\n2. Puja is connected to Pam.\n3. Pam is not directly connected to Raj.\n\nNow, let's continue exploring the connections from step 2:\n\n4. Pam is connected to Wim.\n5. Wim is not directly connected to Raj.\n\nLet's move on to the next connection from step 4:\n\n6. Wim is connected to Wei.\n7. Wei is connected to Kim. \n\nUh-oh, we have reached a loop in the connections, and we cannot proceed further. It seems there is no direct path from Kim to Raj.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Kim to Raj does not exist in this given group of scholars. \n\nAnswer: There is no shortest path from Kim to Raj."
