Explore the connections of Pari's connections:\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari (already visited).\n   - Moin is connected to Pari (already visited).\n   - Puja is connected to Pam and Wei.\n4. Explore the connections of Puja's connections:\n   - Pam is connected to Kim.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim, Puja (already visited), and Pam (already visited).\n5. Explore the connections of Wei's connections:\n   - Kim is connected to Pam (already visited).\n6. Explore the connections of Pam's connections:\n   - Kim is connected to Pam (already visited).\n7.
