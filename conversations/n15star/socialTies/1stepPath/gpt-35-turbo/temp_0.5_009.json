If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari (or Reza), Jing.\n5. If not, check the scholars connected to Pari and Reza: Pari is connected to Moin, Reza, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, Pari, and Max.\n6. Check if Max is connected to Jing. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, Max, Jing.\n7. If not, check the scholars connected to Max: Max is connected to Pari, Moin, and Jing.\n8. Check if Jing is connected to Max. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, Max, Jing.\n9. If not, check the scholars connected to Jing: Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n10. Check if Reza, Moin, or Pari is connected to Jing.
