If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Raj.\n3. If not, check Kim's connections: Pam.\n4. Check Pam's connections: Puja.\n5. Check Puja's connections: Wei.\n6. Check Wei's connections: Kim (already visited), Puja (already visited), and Pam (already visited).\n7. Since we have already visited all of Wei's connections, we move on to the next level.\n8. Check Pam's connections: Puja (already visited), Kim (already visited), and Wei (already visited).\n9. Since we have already visited all of Pam's connections, we move on to the next level.\n10. Check Puja's connections: Pam (already visited), Kim (already visited), and Wei (already visited).\n11. Since we have already visited all of Puja's connections, we move on to the next level.\n12. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n13. Check Pari's connections: Reza.\n14. Check Reza's connections: Moin (already visited) and Pari (already visited).\n15.
