Check Moin's connections: Moin is connected to Pari and Reza.\n3. Add Pari and Reza to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Pari.\n5. Check Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Moin and Reza.\n6. Since Moin is already visited, we skip it.\n7. Add Reza to the queue.\n8. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n9. Check Reza's connections: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n10. Since Moin and Pari are already visited, we skip them.\n11. Add Amir to the queue.\n12. Amir is found! Stop the search.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Moin to Amir is: Moin, Pari, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Amir"
