Start with Amir as the initial node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Remove the first node from the queue and assign it to the current node.\n   b. Check if the current node is Pari. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\n   c. If the current node is not Pari, add all the neighbors of the current node to the queue.\n   d. Mark the current node as visited.\n3. If we have visited all nodes and still haven't found Pari, there is no path from Amir to Pari.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Add them to the queue.\n   Queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n3. Remove the first node from the queue (Reza) and assign it as the current node.\n   Current node: Reza\n4. Check if the current node is Pari. It is not.\n5. Add all the neighbors of Reza (Moin and Pari) to the queue.\n   Queue: [Moin, Pari, Puja, Moin, Pari]\n6. Mark Reza as visited.\n7. Remove the first node from the queue (Moin) and assign it as the current node.\n   Current node: Moin\n8. Check if the current node is Pari. It is not.\n9. Add all the neighbors of Moin (Pari) to the queue.\n   Queue: [Pari, Puja, Moin, Pari, Pari]\n10. Mark Moin as visited.\n11. Remove the first node from the queue (Pari) and assign it as the current node.\n   Current node: Pari\n12. Check if the current node is Pari. It is.\n   Shortest path found: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
