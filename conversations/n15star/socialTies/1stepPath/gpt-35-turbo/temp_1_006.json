Based on the given connections, we can create a graph where each scholar is a node, and the connections between them are edges.\n\n1. Create a graph with the following connections:\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin is connected to Reza and Pari.\n   - Pari is connected to Reza and Moin.\n   - Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Ian, Puja, Sara, and Max are connected to other scholars as mentioned in the given connections.\n\n2. Use a shortest path algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from Reza to Moin.\n\n3. Starting from Reza, the shortest path to Moin is Reza -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin"
