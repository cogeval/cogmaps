From Kim, check each scholar connected to Kim to see if they are connected to Wim.\n3. If a connected scholar is directly connected to Wim, we have found the shortest path.\n4. If not, we can continue traversing through the connected scholars until we reach Wim.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Kim to Wim:\n\n- Kim is directly connected to Puja and Pam.\n- Puja is directly connected to Wim.\n- Therefore, the shortest path from Kim to Wim is: Kim, Puja, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Puja, Wim"
