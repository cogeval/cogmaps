Check if Moin is connected to Pari directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Moin and Pari.\n3. If Moin is not directly connected to Pari, check Moin's connections (Reza and Pari).\n4. Add Reza and Pari to the queue.\n5. Check Reza's connections (Moin and Pari). Since Moin is already visited, we skip it.\n6. Add Pari to the queue.\n7. Check Pari's connections (Moin and Reza). Since Moin and Reza are already visited, we skip them.\n8. The queue is now empty, and we have visited all the scholars connected to Moin.\n9. Since Pari is not found, we need to backtrack to find the shortest path.\n10. We backtrack from Pari to Reza.\n11. We backtrack from Reza to Moin.\n12. The shortest path from Moin to Pari is Moin, Reza, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Reza, Pari"
