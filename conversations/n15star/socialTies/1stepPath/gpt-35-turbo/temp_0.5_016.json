We will start from Puja and explore each scholar connected to Puja, then move to the scholars connected to those scholars, and so on, until we reach Amir.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at Puja.\n2. Puja is connected to Kim, Reza, and Wei. We will explore these scholars next.\n3. From Kim, we can reach Pam. Add Pam to the list.\n4. From Reza, we can reach Moin and Pari. Add Moin and Pari to the list.\n5. From Wei, we can reach Kim, Puja, and Pam. However, we have already explored Kim and Pam, so we only add Puja to the list.\n6. Now, we have the following scholars in our list: Pam, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n7. From Pam, we can reach Kim. Add Kim to the list.\n8. From Moin, we can reach Pari. Add Pari to the list.\n9. From Pari, we can reach Moin. Add Moin to the list.\n10. From Puja, we can reach Kim, Reza, and Wei. However, we have already explored Kim and Reza, so we only add Wei to the list.\n11. Now, we have the following scholars in our list: Pam, Moin, Pari, Kim, and Wei.\n12. From Pam, we have already explored all connected scholars.\n13. From Moin, we have already explored all connected scholars.\n14. From Pari, we have already explored all connected scholars.\n15. From Kim, we have already explored all connected scholars.\n16. From Wei, we can reach Kim, Puja, and Pam. However, we have already explored Kim, Puja, and Pam, so there are no new scholars to add.\n17. Now, we have explored all possible scholars connected to Puja.\n18. The shortest path from Puja to Amir is: Puja, Reza, Moin, Pari, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Reza, Moin, Pari, Amir"
