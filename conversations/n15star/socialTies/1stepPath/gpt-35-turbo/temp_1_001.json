Start with the initial queue containing only Amir.\n2. Take the first scholar from the queue.\n3. If the scholar is Moin, we have found the shortest path. \n4. If not, add all the scholars connected to the current scholar to the end of the queue.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we find Moin or the queue becomes empty.\n\nHere is the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"
