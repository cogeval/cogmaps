Check if Pari is connected to Moin directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Pari and Moin. Answer: Pari, Moin.\n3. If Pari is not directly connected to Moin, check Pari's connections: Amir and Reza.\n4. Check if Amir is connected to Moin directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, Amir, and Moin. Answer: Pari, Amir, Moin.\n5. If Amir is not connected to Moin, check Amir's connections: Reza.\n6. Check if Reza is connected to Moin directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, Amir, Reza, and Moin. Answer: Pari, Amir, Reza, Moin.\n7. If Reza is not connected to Moin, check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n8. Since Reza is connected to Moin, the shortest path is Pari, Amir, Reza, and Moin. Answer: Pari, Amir, Reza, Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pari to Moin is Pari, Amir, Reza, and Moin. Answer: Pari, Amir, Reza, Moin."
