Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Jing, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Jing has not been found, there is no path from Moin to Jing.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Moin to Jing is:\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Jing"
