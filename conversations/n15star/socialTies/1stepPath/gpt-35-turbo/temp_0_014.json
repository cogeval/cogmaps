If yes, the shortest path is just Pari and Reza. Answer: Pari, Reza.\n3. If Pari is not directly connected to Reza, check Pari's connections: Amir, Moin, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Pari's connections are directly connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, the connection, and Reza. Answer: Pari, [connection], Reza.\n5. If none of Pari's connections are directly connected to Reza, check the connections of Pari's connections.\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, so the shortest path is Pari, Amir, and Reza. Answer: Pari, Amir, Reza.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari, but not directly connected to Reza. Check Moin's connections: Reza and Pari.\n     - Reza is directly connected to Moin, so the shortest path is Pari, Moin, and Reza. Answer: Pari, Moin, Reza.\n     - Pari is already visited, so we skip it.\n   - Puja is connected to Pari, but not directly connected to Reza. Check Puja's connections: Wim, Wei, and Pam.\n     - Wim is not connected to Reza.\n     - Wei is connected to Reza, so the shortest path is Pari, Puja, Wei, and Reza. Answer: Pari, Puja, Wei, Reza.\n     - Pam is connected to Kim, but not directly connected to Reza. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n       - Pam is directly connected to Kim, but not to Reza.\n       - Kim is not connected to Reza.\n6. We have exhausted all possible paths, and the shortest path from Pari to Reza is Pari, Moin, Reza. Answer: Pari, Moin, Reza."
