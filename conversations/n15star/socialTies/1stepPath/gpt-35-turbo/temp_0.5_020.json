If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Wei. If not, continue to the next step.\n3. Check if Wim is connected to any scholars. If yes, add them to a queue.\n4. Remove Wim from the queue and check if the removed scholar is connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, the removed scholar, Wei. If not, continue to the next step.\n5. Check if the removed scholar is connected to any scholars not already in the queue. If yes, add them to the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until either the shortest path is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Wei:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Wim is not directly connected to Wei, so continue to the next step.\n3. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Add them to the queue: Kim, Puja, Pam.\n4. Remove Kim from the queue. Kim is not directly connected to Wei, so continue to the next step.\n5. Kim is connected to Pam. Add Pam to the queue: Puja, Pam.\n6. Remove Puja from the queue. Puja is connected to Wei. The shortest path from Wim to Wei is: Wim, Puja, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Wei"
