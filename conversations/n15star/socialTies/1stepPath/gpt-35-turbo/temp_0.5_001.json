Check if Amir is connected to Moin directly. If yes, the shortest path is just \"Amir, Moin\".\n3. If not, check the connections of Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja). \n   - Reza is connected to Moin, so the path becomes \"Amir, Reza, Moin\".\n   - Moin is already connected to Moin, so we can skip it.\n   - Pari is not connected to Moin.\n   - Puja is not connected to Moin.\n4. Check the connections of Reza's connections (Moin and Pari).\n   - Moin is already connected to Moin, so we can skip it.\n   - Pari is connected to Moin, so the path becomes \"Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin\".\n5. Check the connections of Pari's connections (Moin).\n   - Moin is already connected to Moin, so we can skip it.\n6. Check the connections of Puja's connections (Pam).\n   - Pam is not connected to Moin.\n7. Since we have exhausted all possible connections, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is \"Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin\".\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin."
