Check if Pari is connected to Jing directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, Jing.\n3. If not, check the connections of Pari and add them to a queue.\n4. Remove Pari from the queue.\n5. Take the next scholar from the queue and check if they are connected to Jing directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pari, [next scholar], Jing.\n6. If not, add the connections of the next scholar to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until Jing is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Pari to Jing:\n\n1. Start with Pari.\n2. Pari is not directly connected to Jing.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, and Puja to the queue.\n4. Remove Pari from the queue.\n5. Take Reza from the queue.\n6. Reza is not directly connected to Jing.\n7. Add Moin and Pari to the queue (Pari is already in the queue, so we don't add it again).\n8. Remove Reza from the queue.\n9. Take Moin from the queue.\n10. Moin is not directly connected to Jing.\n11. Add Pari to the queue (already in the queue).\n12. Remove Moin from the queue.\n13. Take Puja from the queue.\n14. Puja is not directly connected to Jing.\n15. Add Pam to the queue.\n16. Remove Puja from the queue.\n17. Take Pam from the queue.\n18. Pam is not directly connected to Jing.\n19. The queue is now empty, and Jing is not found.\n\nBased on the steps above, there is no path from Pari to Jing. Therefore, the shortest path from Pari to Jing is not possible.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from Pari to Jing."
