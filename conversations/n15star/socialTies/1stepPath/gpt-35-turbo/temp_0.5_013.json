Check Pari's connections: Pari is connected to Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check Reza's connections: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Since Jing is not in Reza's connections, we move on.\n4. Check Moin's connections: Moin is connected to Pari. Since Jing is not in Moin's connections, we move on.\n5. Check Puja's connections: Puja is connected to Pam, Kim, Wei, and Wim. Since Jing is not in Puja's connections, we move on.\n6. Check Pam's connections: Pam is connected to Puja and Kim. Since Jing is not in Pam's connections, we move on.\n7. Check Kim's connections: Kim is connected to Puja, Pam, Wei, and Raj. Since Jing is not in Kim's connections, we move on.\n8. Check Wei's connections: Wei is connected to Puja, Pam, and Wim. Since Jing is not in Wei's connections, we move on.\n9. Check Wim's connections: Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Since Jing is not in Wim's connections, we move on.\n10. Check Raj's connections: Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Since Jing is not in Raj's connections, we move on.\n11. Check Nisha's connections: Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Since Jing is not in Nisha's connections, we move on.\n12. Check Ian's connections: Ian is connected to Sara and Max. Since Jing is not in Ian's connections, we move on.\n13. Check Sara's connections: Sara is connected to Max. Since Jing is not in Sara's connections, we move on.\n14. Check Max's connections: Max is connected to Nisha and Jing. We have found Jing!\n15. The shortest path from Pari to Jing is: Pari, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing"
