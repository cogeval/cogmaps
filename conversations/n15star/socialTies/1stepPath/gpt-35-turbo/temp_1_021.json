Starting from Wim, we know that Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. So we can go from Wim to either Wei, Kim, Puja, or Pam.\n\n2. From Wim, let's choose the path that leads us closer to Kim. Since Wim is directly connected to Kim, we can choose to go directly to Kim.\n\n3. Therefore, the shortest path from Wim to Kim is Wim, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim"
