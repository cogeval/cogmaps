Since we have already visited all the connections of Reza, we move on to the next level.\n6. Check the connections of Moin: Pari and Reza (already visited).\n7. Check the connections of Pari: Moin and Reza (already visited).\n8. Since we have already visited all the connections of Moin and Pari, we move on to the next level.\n9.
