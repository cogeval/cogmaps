Check Wei's connections: Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Check Kim's connections: Kim is connected to Pam.\n4. Check Puja's connections: Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. Check Pam's connections: Pam is connected to Wim.\n6. We have reached Wim.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Wim is: Wei, Pam, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Pam, Wim"
