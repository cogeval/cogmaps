Check the scholars connected to Amir (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja).\n3. Add Reza to the list.\n4. Check the scholars connected to Reza (Moin and Pari).\n5. Add Moin and Pari to the list.\n6. Check the scholars connected to Moin (Pari).\n7. Add Pari to the list.\n8. Check the scholars connected to Pari (Puja).\n9. Add Puja to the list.\n10. Reza is now connected to all scholars in the group, so the shortest path from Amir to Reza is: Amir, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza"
