Check if Wim is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Puja.\n3. If Wim is not directly connected to Puja, check if Wim is connected to any scholars who are connected to Puja.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each scholar connected to Wim.\n5. Continue this process until Puja is found or all possible paths have been explored.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's find the shortest path from Wim to Puja:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n2. Wim is directly connected to Puja, so the shortest path is Wim, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja"
