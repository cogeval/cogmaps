Moin and Pari have no direct connection to Jing.\n\nLooking at the scholars who are connected to Jing, we can see that:\n1. Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n2. None of the scholars who are directly connected to Jing (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max) are in the direct connections of Reza (Amir, Moin, Pari) except for Moin and Pari.\n\nGiven that Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin and Pari, and that Reza is also directly connected to Moin and Pari, it's clear that Reza could reach Jing through Moin or Pari.\n\nConsidering all this information, the shortest path from Reza to Jing would be a direct route through Moin or Pari. Here are two shortest paths:\nPath 1: Reza, Moin, Jing\nPath 2: Reza, Pari, Jing\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Jing or Reza, Pari, Jing."
