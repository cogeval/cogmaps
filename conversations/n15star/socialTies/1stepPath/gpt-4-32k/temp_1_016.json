However, neither Wim nor Pam is directly connected to Amir. Therefore, we need to find a common person between Puja's connections and Amir's connections.\n\nLooking closer, we can see that Wim is connected to Puja and Amir is connected to Puja. Hence, we can infer that Puja can reach Amir via Wim.\n\nThe shortest path from Puja to Amir is: Puja - Wim - Amir.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim, Amir."
