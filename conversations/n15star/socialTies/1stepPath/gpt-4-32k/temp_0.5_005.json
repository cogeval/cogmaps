Reza is directly connected to Moin and Pari. \n\nStep 2: Check the connections of Moin and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari, but neither of them is connected to Jing.\n\nStep 3: Check the connections of Amir because Amir is also connected to Reza. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 4: Check the connections of Puja. Puja is connected to Pam and Wim.\n\nStep 5: Check the connections of Wim. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nStep 6: None of Wim's connections lead to Jing. \n\nStep 7: Go back to Amir's connections. None of them lead to Jing.\n\nStep 8: Check the connections of Jing. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n\nStep 9: Since Jing is directly connected to Reza, the shortest path from Reza to Jing is just Reza, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing"
