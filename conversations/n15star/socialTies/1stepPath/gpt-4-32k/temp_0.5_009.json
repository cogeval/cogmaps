The scholars connected to Moin are Reza and Pari.\n\nStep 2: Check if Jing is among the scholars connected to Moin. Jing is not directly connected to Moin.\n\nStep 3: Check the scholars that are connected to Reza and Pari. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Pari is connected to Moin, Amir, and Jing.\n\nStep 4: Check if Jing is among the scholars connected to Reza or Pari. Jing is connected to Pari.\n\nStep 5: The shortest path from Moin to Jing is therefore Moin, Pari, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Jing"
