Following are the connections:\n\n- Amir -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n- Wim -> Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Raj -> Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n- Jing -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n- Wei -> Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Nisha -> Ian, Sara, Max\n- Reza -> Moin, Pari\n- Kim -> Pam\n- Ian -> Sara, Max\n- Moin -> Pari\n- Puja -> Pam\n- Sara -> Max\n\nFrom the above connections, it can be seen that Puja is directly connected to Wim. Therefore, the shortest path from Puja to Wim is simply Puja directly to Wim.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim"
