Check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n4. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n5. Check Pam's connections: Wei, Kim, Puja.\n6. Check Wei's connections again: Kim, Puja, and Pam (already visited).\n7. Since we have already visited all possible connections from Wei, we move on to the next level.\n8. Check Kim's connections again: Pam (already visited).\n9. Check Puja's connections again: Pam (already visited).\n10. Check Pam's connections again: Wei, Kim, Puja (already visited).\n11.
