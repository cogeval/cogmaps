Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is connected to Moin.\n5. Kim is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is not connected to any other scholars mentioned in the group.\n7. Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max are not directly connected to Puja.\n\nSince Puja is not directly connected to Matt, we need to find a path that connects Puja to Matt through other scholars. However, there is no direct connection between Puja and Matt through the given connections.\n\nAnswer: There is no shortest path from Puja to Matt based on the given connections."
