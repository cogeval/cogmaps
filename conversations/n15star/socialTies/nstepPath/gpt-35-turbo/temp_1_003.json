Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to him and keep track of the visited scholars.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Explore scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the visited list.\n4. Explore scholars connected to Reza: Moin, Pari.\n5. Add Moin and Pari to the visited list.\n6. Explore scholars connected to Moin: Pari.\n7. Add Pari to the visited list.\n8. Explore scholars connected to Pari: None.\n9. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Amir, move to the next scholar.\n10. Explore scholars connected to Moin: Pari.\n11. Since Pari is already visited, skip it.\n12. Explore scholars connected to Pari: None.\n13. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Moin, move to the next scholar.\n14. Explore scholars connected to Pari: None.\n15. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Pari, move to the next scholar.\n16. Explore scholars connected to Puja: Pam.\n17. Add Pam to the visited list.\n18. Explore scholars connected to Pam: None.\n19. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Puja, move to the next scholar.\n20. Explore scholars connected to Reza: Moin, Pari.\n21. Since Moin and Pari are already visited, skip them.\n22. Explore scholars connected to Moin: Pari.\n23. Since Pari is already visited, skip it.\n24. Explore scholars connected to Pari: None.\n25. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Reza, move to the next scholar.\n26. Explore scholars connected to Pari: None.\n27. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Pari, move to the next scholar.\n28. Explore scholars connected to Puja: Pam.\n29. Since Pam is already visited, skip it.\n30. Explore scholars connected to Pam: None.\n31. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Puja, move to the next scholar.\n32. Explore scholars connected to Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n33. Since Wei, Kim, and Puja are already visited, skip them.\n34. Explore scholars connected to Pam: None.\n35. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Wim, move to the next scholar.\n36.

Since Ian and Sara are already visited, skip them.\n40. Add Max to the visited list.\n41. Explore scholars connected to Max: None.\n42. Since there are no more unvisited scholars connected to Nisha, move to the next scholar.\n43. Explore scholars connected to Ian: Sara, Max.\n44. Since Sara and Max are already visited, skip them.\n45. Explore scholars connected to Sara: Max.\n46. Since Max is already visited, skip it.\n47. Explore scholars connected to Max: None.\n48.
