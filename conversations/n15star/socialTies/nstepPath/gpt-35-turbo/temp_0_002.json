Check if Amir is connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Sara.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection, and then Sara.\n5. If not, check the connections of Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Sara is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is:\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Sara\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Sara"
