While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current_scholar variable.\n   b. Check if the current_scholar is Ian. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n   c. Otherwise, get the connections of the current_scholar.\n   d. For each connection, check if it has already been visited. If it has not, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   e. Repeat steps a-d until either Ian is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to Ian is as follows:\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Ian\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Ian"
