Check if Nisha is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Nisha, Puja. Answer: Nisha, Puja.\n3. If Nisha is not directly connected to Puja, we need to explore the connections of Nisha's connections.\n4. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. We will enqueue these scholars.\n5. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Ian.\n6. Check if Ian is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Ian, Puja. Answer: Nisha, Ian, Puja.\n7. If Ian is not directly connected to Puja, we enqueue Ian's connections, which are Sara and Max.\n8. Dequeue the next scholar from the queue, which is Sara.\n9. Check if Sara is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Ian, Sara, Puja. Answer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Puja.\n10. If Sara is not directly connected to Puja, we enqueue Sara's connections, which are Max.\n11. Dequeue the next scholar from the queue, which is Max.\n12. Check if Max is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Puja. Answer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Puja.\n13. If Max is not directly connected to Puja, we enqueue Max's connections, which are Nisha (already visited), Ian (already visited), and Sara (already visited).\n14. Now, there are no more scholars to explore, and we haven't found a direct path from Nisha to Puja. Therefore, there is no path from Nisha to Puja.\n\nThe shortest path from Nisha to Puja is Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Puja."
