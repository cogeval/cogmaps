Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Reza, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Raj to Reza.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Raj to Reza is:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Reza"
