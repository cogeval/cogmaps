Puja is then connected to both Wei and Wim.\n\nFrom Wei, we can see that Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. However, since we have already visited Kim and Puja, we can skip them and proceed to Pam.\n\nFrom Pam, we can see that Pam is connected to both Kim and Puja. Since we have already visited Kim and Puja, we can skip them and move on.\n\nNext, from Wim, we can see that Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. However, we have already visited Wei, Kim, and Pam, so we can skip them and move on.\n\nFinally, from Amir, we can see that Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since Moin is the scholar we are looking for, this is our final destination.\n\nBased on the connections, the shortest path from Kim to Moin would be:\n\nKim, Puja, Wei, Pam, Wim, Amir, Moin\n\nAnswer: Kim, Puja, Wei, Pam, Wim, Amir, Moin"
