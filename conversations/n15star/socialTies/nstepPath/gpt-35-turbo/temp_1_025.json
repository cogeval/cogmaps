Let's start with Raj and visit each scholar connected to Raj, then move to the scholars connected to those scholars until we reach Moin.\n\n1. Starting with Raj:\n   Raj\n\n2. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Let's visit them in the following order:\n   Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n\n3. Kim is connected to Pam. Let's visit Pam:\n   Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Pam\n\n4. Pam is connected to Puja. Let's visit Puja:\n   Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Pam, Puja\n\n5. Puja is connected to Wei. Let's visit Wei:\n   Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Pam, Puja, Wei\n\n6. Wei is connected to Kim. Since we have already visited Kim, we can skip this step.\n\n7. Kim is connected to Moin. Let's visit Moin:\n   Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Moin\n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Moin is:\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Moin"
