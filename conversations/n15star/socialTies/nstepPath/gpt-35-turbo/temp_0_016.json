Starting from Wei, we will explore each scholar's connections until we reach Matt.\n\n1. Start at Wei.\n2. Check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n4. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n5. Check Pam's connections: No new connections.\n6. Since Matt is not connected to any of Wei's connections, we need to backtrack.\n7. Backtrack to Wei and check the next connection: Kim.\n8. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n9. Check Pam's connections: No new connections.\n10. Since Matt is not connected to Kim's connections, we need to backtrack again.\n11. Backtrack to Wei and check the next connection: Puja.\n12. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n13. Check Pam's connections: No new connections.\n14. Since Matt is not connected to Puja's connections, we need to backtrack again.\n15. Backtrack to Wei and check the next connection: Pam.\n16. Check Pam's connections: No new connections.\n17. Since Matt is not connected to Pam's connections, we need to backtrack again.\n18. Backtrack to Wei and check the next connection: No more connections to check.\n\nBased on the exploration, there is no path from Wei to Matt. Therefore, there is no shortest path from Wei to Matt.\n\nAnswer: There is no shortest path from Wei to Matt."
