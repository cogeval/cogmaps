Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue their connected scholars.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found Raj, there is no path from Moin to Raj.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Moin to Raj is:\n\nMoin, Pari, Raj\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Raj"
