We will explore these connections next.\n3. Ian is connected to Sara and Max. We will explore these connections next.\n4. Sara is connected to Max. We will explore this connection next.\n5. Max is connected to Jing, Nisha, and Sara. Since we have already visited Nisha and Sara, we will explore the connection with Jing next.\n6. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Since we have already visited Max, we will explore the connections with Reza, Moin, and Pari next.\n7. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Since we have already visited Moin and Pari, we will explore the connection with Moin next.\n8. Moin is connected to Pari.
