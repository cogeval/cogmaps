Check Puja's connections: Puja is connected to Pam, Kim, and Wei.\n3. Add Pam, Kim, and Wei to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Pam.\n5. Check Pam's connections: Pam is connected to Puja and Kim.\n6. Since Puja is already visited, we skip it. But Kim is not visited yet, so we add Kim to the queue.\n7. Continue this process until we find Ian or the queue becomes empty.\n8. The shortest path from Puja to Ian is: Puja, Pam, Kim, Ian.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Pam, Kim, Ian"
