Check if Pari is connected to Raj directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Pari and Raj.\n3. If Pari is not directly connected to Raj, we need to explore the connections of Pari's connections.\n4. Pari is connected to Amir, Reza, Moin, and Puja. We will explore these connections in the next level.\n5. Amir is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n6. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Since Moin is already in the path, we skip it to avoid cycles.\n7. Puja is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n8. Moin is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n9. Now, we have explored all the connections in the first level. We move on to the second level.\n10. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Since Pari is already in the path, we skip it to avoid cycles.\n11. Moin is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n12. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n13. Now, we have explored all the connections in the second level. We move on to the third level.\n14. Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is not connected to Raj, so we move on.\n15. Now, we have explored all the connections in the third level. We move on to the fourth level.\n16. There are no connections in the fourth level.\n17. Since we have explored all the connections and have not found Raj, there is no path from Pari to Raj.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Pari to Raj."
