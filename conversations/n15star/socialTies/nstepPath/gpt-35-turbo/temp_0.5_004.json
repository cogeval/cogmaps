If yes, the shortest path is just Reza and Kim.\n3. If Reza is not directly connected to Kim, check who Reza is connected to.\n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Add Moin and Pari to the queue.\n5. Check who Moin is connected to. Moin is connected to Pari. Add Pari to the queue.\n6. Check who Pari is connected to. Pari is connected to Reza and Moin. Since Reza and Moin are already in the queue, we don't add them again.\n7. Check who is next in the queue. It's Kim. We have found the shortest path from Reza to Kim.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Moin, Pari, Kim"
