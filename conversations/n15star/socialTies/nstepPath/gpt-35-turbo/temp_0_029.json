Check if Nisha is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Amir.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n4. Check if any of Nisha's connections are connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, the connected scholar, Amir.\n5. If not, check the connections of Nisha's connections: Ian's connections are Sara and Max, Sara's connections are Ian and Max, and Max's connections are Nisha and Sara.\n6. Check if any of the connections of Nisha's connections are connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, the connected scholar, the connected scholar's connection, Amir.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Amir is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Nisha to Amir is:\n\nNisha, Max, Sara, Ian, Amir\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Max, Sara, Ian, Amir"
