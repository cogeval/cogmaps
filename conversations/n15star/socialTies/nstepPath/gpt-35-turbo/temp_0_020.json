Check if Kim is connected to Pari directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Pari.\n3. If not, check if Kim is connected to any other scholars. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each scholar in the queue until Pari is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Kim.\n2. Kim is not directly connected to Pari.\n3. Kim is connected to Puja and Pam. Add them to the queue.\n4. Puja is connected to Pari. The shortest path from Kim to Pari is Kim, Puja, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Puja, Pari"
