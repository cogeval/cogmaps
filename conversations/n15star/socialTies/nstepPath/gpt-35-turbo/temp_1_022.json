None of these connections are directly connected to Matt.\n\nNext, we can check the connections of Kim, Puja, and Wei to see if any of them are connected to Matt.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Kim is connected to Pam and Ian. Ian is connected to Max, and Max is connected to Nisha. Nisha is not directly connected to Matt, so this path does not lead to Matt.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Puja is connected to Pam and Wei. Wei is not directly connected to Matt, so this path does not lead to Matt.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim, Puja, and Pam have already been checked and none of them are directly connected to Matt. So, this path does not lead to Matt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, there is no direct or indirect path from Pam to Matt. \n\nAnswer: There is no path from Pam to Matt."
