Starting from Puja, we will explore all possible connections and keep track of the shortest path to each scholar. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty visited set.\n2. Enqueue Puja and mark Puja as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   2. If the scholar is Sara, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the path.\n   3. Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar, and mark them as visited. Also, keep track of the path taken to reach each scholar.\n4. If we have not found a path from Puja to Sara, return \"No path found\".\n\nApplying this algorithm, the shortest path from Puja to Sara is:\nPuja, Kim, Sara\n\nAnswer: Puja, Kim, Sara"
