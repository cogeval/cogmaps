Check if Nisha is directly connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Puja.\n3. If Nisha is not directly connected to Puja, check if Nisha is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, directly connected scholar, Puja.\n4. If Nisha is not directly connected to Puja or any scholars who are directly connected to Puja, continue to explore the connections of Nisha's directly connected scholars.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until either Puja is found or there are no more connections to explore.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Nisha to Puja is:\n\nNisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Puja."
