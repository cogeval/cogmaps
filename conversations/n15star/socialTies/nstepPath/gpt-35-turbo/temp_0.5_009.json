Pari is connected to Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but we have already visited Pari, so we skip Reza.\n4. Moin is connected to Pari, but we have already visited Pari, so we skip Moin.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam, Wei, and Kim.\n6. Pam is not connected to Raj, so we skip Pam.\n7. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam, but we have already visited Puja and Pam, so we skip Wei.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam, but we have already visited Pam, so we skip Kim.\n9. We have finished exploring all the scholars connected to Pari.\n\nNow, we move to the scholars connected to Puja:\n\n10. Puja is connected to Pam, Wei, and Kim, but we have already visited Pam and Kim, so we skip Puja.\n11. We have finished exploring all the scholars connected to Puja.\n\nFinally, we move to the scholars connected to Pam:\n\n12. Pam is connected to Puja, but we have already visited Puja, so we skip Pam.\n13. We have finished exploring all the scholars connected to Pam.\n\nSince we have explored all the possible paths, we can conclude that there is no path from Pari to Raj.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Pari to Raj."
