Check if Nisha is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Puja.\n3. If Nisha is not directly connected to Puja, check Nisha's connections (Ian, Sara, and Max).\n4. Check if any of Nisha's connections are directly connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, the connecting scholar, Puja.\n5. If none of Nisha's connections are directly connected to Puja, check the connections of Nisha's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Puja is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Nisha to Puja is:\n\nNisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Nisha, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Nisha, Moin, Pari, Puja"
