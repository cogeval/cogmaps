Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Since Kim is already mentioned, we can skip it. So, the next scholar in the path is Puja. \n\nMoving on to Puja, we know that Puja is connected to Pam. So, Pam is the next scholar in the path. \n\nFinally, we need to find the connections of Pam. Pam is not connected to Matt, so we cannot continue the path further. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wim to Matt is:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei, Puja, Pam"
