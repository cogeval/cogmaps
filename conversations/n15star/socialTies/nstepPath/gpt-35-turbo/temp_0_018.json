Check Puja's connections: Pam, Wim, and Amir.\n7. Since Kim, Pam, and Puja are already visited, we ignore them.\n8. Check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n9. Since Kim, Pam, and Puja are already visited, we ignore them.\n10. Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n11. Since Kim, Pam, Puja, and Reza are already visited, we ignore them.\n12.
