Based on the given connections, we can construct a graph where each scholar is represented as a node and the connections between them are represented as edges.\n\n1. Starting from Raj, we can traverse the graph to find a path to Amir. We will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\n2. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Enqueue Raj into the queue and add Raj to the visited set.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is Amir. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Return the path.\n   c. Otherwise, for each connected scholar that has not been visited, enqueue them into the queue, add them to the visited set, and update their path by appending the current scholar to their previous scholar's path.\n\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found Amir, it means there is no path from Raj to Amir.\n\nApplying the above steps:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Kim, Wei, Puja, Amir"
