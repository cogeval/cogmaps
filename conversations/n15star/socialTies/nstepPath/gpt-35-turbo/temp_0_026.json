Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Set the parent of the neighbor as the dequeued node in the parent dictionary.\n6. If we reach this step, it means there is no path from Raj to Pari.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Pari:\n\n1. Start with Raj.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Mark Raj as visited.\n4. Raj has no neighbors connected to Pari.\n5. The queue is empty, and there is no path from Raj to Pari.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Raj to Pari."
