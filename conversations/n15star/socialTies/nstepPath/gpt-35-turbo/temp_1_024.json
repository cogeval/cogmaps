Start with Raj.\n2. Check Raj's connections: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n3. Proceed to Nisha.\n4. Check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n5. Proceed to Ian.\n6. Check Ian's connections: Sara and Max.\n7. Proceed to Sara.\n8. Check Sara's connections: Max.\n9. Proceed to Max.\n10. Check Max's connections: Reza, Moin, and Pari.\n11. Reza is one of the connections, so the shortest path from Raj to Reza is:\n    Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Reza"
