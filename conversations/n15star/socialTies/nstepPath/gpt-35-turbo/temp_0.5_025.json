Start with Raj as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Moin, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and Moin is not found, there is no path from Raj to Moin.\n\nApplying the algorithm, the shortest path from Raj to Moin is:\n\nRaj, Kim, Pari, Moin\n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Pari, Moin"
