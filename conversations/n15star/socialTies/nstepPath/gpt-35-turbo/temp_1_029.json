Start with Nisha as the initial node.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Nisha.\n3. Create an empty visited set and add Nisha to the set.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Nisha to the list.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n     - Check if the dequeued scholar is Amir:\n          - If yes, return the path list.\n          - If no, continue to the next step.\n     - Get all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n     - For each connected scholar:\n          - If the scholar is not in the visited set:\n               - Enqueue the scholar.\n               - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n               - Add the scholar to the path list.\n               - Move to the next iteration of the while loop.\n6. If no path is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nApplying the steps to the given information, the shortest path from Nisha to Amir is as follows:\nNisha, Ian, Max, Sara, Pari, Amir\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Max, Sara, Pari, Amir"
