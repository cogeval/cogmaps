Check if Amir is connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Raj.\n3. If not, check the connections of Amir and add them to a queue.\n4. Remove Amir from the queue.\n5. Take the next scholar from the queue.\n6. Check if the scholar is connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is the current scholar, Amir, and Raj.\n7. If not, add the connections of the current scholar to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until Raj is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is not directly connected to Raj.\n3. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Add them to the queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n4. Remove Amir from the queue.\n5. Take Reza from the queue.\n6. Reza is not directly connected to Raj.\n7. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Add them to the queue: Moin, Pari, Moin, Pari.\n8. Remove Reza from the queue.\n9. Take Moin from the queue.\n10. Moin is not directly connected to Raj.\n11. Moin is connected to Pari. Add Pari to the queue: Pari, Pari.\n12. Remove Moin from the queue.\n13. Take Pari from the queue.\n14. Pari is not directly connected to Raj.\n15. Pari is not connected to any other scholars. The queue is empty.\n16. Since we have explored all possible connections and Raj was not found, there is no path from Amir to Raj.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to Raj."
