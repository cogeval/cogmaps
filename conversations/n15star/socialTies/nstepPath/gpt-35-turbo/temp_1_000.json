Check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n6. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n7. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Moin.\n8. Check Moin's connections: Pari.\n9. Enqueue Pari.\n10. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Pari.\n11. Check Pari's connections: Puja.\n12. Enqueue Puja.\n13. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Puja.\n14. Check Puja's connections: Pam.\n15. Enqueue Pam.\n16. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Pam.\n17. Check Pam's connections: Kim.\n18. Enqueue Kim.\n19.
