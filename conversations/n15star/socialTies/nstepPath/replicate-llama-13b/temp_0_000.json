In this case, we have a graph with 15 scholars, and each scholar is connected to some other scholars.\nStep 1: Identify the nodes that Amir is connected to.\nAnswer: Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 2: Identify the nodes that Nisha is connected to.\n\nAnswer: Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nStep 3: Find the shortest path from Amir to Nisha.\n\nAnswer: The shortest path from Amir to Nisha is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Ian, Sara, Max, Nisha.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Nisha is 7 nodes long.\n\nPlease note that the order of the scholars in the path is important, as the path is a sequence of edges between nodes."
