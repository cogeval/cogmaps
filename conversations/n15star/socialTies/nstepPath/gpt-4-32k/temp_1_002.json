Sara to Max\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Sara should consist of the least number of intermediary scholars.\n\nLooking at the connections, Amir could get to Sara following this path:\n\nAmir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Raj -> Sara\n\nThis path consists of four intermediary scholars. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Sara. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Sara."
