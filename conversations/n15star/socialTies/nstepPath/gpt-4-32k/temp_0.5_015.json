Kim is not connected to Jing, but is directly connected to Wei.\n5. Wei is not connected to Jing, but is directly connected to Wim.\n6. Wim is directly connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Pam.\n7. Pam is not connected to Jing, but is directly connected to Kim.\n8. Kim is not connected to Jing, but is directly connected to Wei.\n9. Wei is not connected to Jing, but is directly connected to Wim.\n10. Wim is directly connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Amir.\n11. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari.\n12. Reza, Moin, and Pari are directly connected to Jing.\n\nFrom these connections, I can determine the shortest path from Wim to Jing:\n\nWim -> Puja -> Amir -> Reza -> Jing\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wim to Jing is through Puja, Amir, and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Puja, Amir, Reza, Jing"
