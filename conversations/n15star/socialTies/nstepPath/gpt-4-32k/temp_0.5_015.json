First, let's list all the connections between the students:\n   - Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n   - Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n   - Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n   - Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Soheil, Alice\n   - Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Gongxue, Alice\n   - Ajit, Anisha\n\n2. Identify the groups that Vivian and Ajit are part of:\n   - Vivian: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n   - Ajit: Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil; Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha; Durga, Ajit, Anisha; Ajit, Anisha\n\n3. Find the common students between Vivian's group and Ajit's groups:\n   - No common students found.\n\n4. Find connections between Vivian's group and Ajit's groups:\n   - Gongxue is connected to Alice (Vivian's group)\n   - Soheil is connected to Alice (Ajit's group)\n   - Salma, Shanshan, Vadim are connected to Anisha (Vivian's group)\n   - Abdul, Durga, Ajit are connected to Anisha (Ajit's group)\n\n5. Determine the shortest path:\n   - Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil -> Ajit (4 connections)\n   - Vivian -> Salma -> Anisha -> Ajit (3 connections)\n   - Vivian -> Shanshan -> Anisha -> Ajit (3 connections)\n   - Vivian -> Vadim -> Anisha -> Ajit (3 connections)\n\n6. Choose the shortest path with the fewest connections: Vivian -> Salma -> Anisha -> Ajit\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha, Ajit"
