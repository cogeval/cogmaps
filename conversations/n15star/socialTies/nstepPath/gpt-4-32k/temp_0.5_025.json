Nisha is directly connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n4. Ian is directly connected to Sara, and Max.\n5. Sara is directly connected to Max.\n6. Max is directly connected to Jing.\n7. Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n8. Moin is directly connected to Pari and Reza.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Raj to Moin, we need to find the fewest steps it takes to get from Raj to Moin. \n\nLooking at the connections, the shortest path from Raj to Moin seems to be: \n\nRaj -> Nisha -> Max -> Jing -> Moin. \n\nThis path includes 4 steps. \n\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Max, Jing, Moin."
