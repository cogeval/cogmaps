Starting from Moin, the scholars connected to Moin are Reza and Pari. \n\n2. Neither Reza nor Pari is directly connected to Kim, so we need to look at their connections. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, which does not help in this case. Pari is connected to Amir, Jing, and Reza.\n\n3. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, Wim, Wei, and Amir. \n\n4. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. \n\n5. Kim is finally found connected to Wim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Moin to Kim is: Moin, Pari, Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim."
