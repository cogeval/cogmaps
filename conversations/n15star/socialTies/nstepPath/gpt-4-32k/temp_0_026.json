Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. \n\nSecond, we need to find out if any of these scholars are directly connected to Pari. None of them are.\n\nThird, we need to look at the second degree connections. Nisha is connected to Max, but Max is not connected to Pari. Ian is connected to Sara and Max, but neither of them are connected to Pari. Sara is connected to Max, but Max is not connected to Pari. Kim is connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to Pari.\n\nFourth, we need to look at the third degree connections. The only third degree connection that leads to Pari is through Amir. Raj can connect to Amir through Kim and Wim. Amir is directly connected to Pari.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Pari is: Raj, Kim, Wim, Amir, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Wim, Amir, Pari"
