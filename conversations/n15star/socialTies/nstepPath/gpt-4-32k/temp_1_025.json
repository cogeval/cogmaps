Raj is directly connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n2. None of Nisha, Ian, Sara, or Kim are directly connected to Moin.\n3. Now let's check who Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim are connected to.\n   - Nisha is connected to Max.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n4. None of them are directly connected to Moin either. Continue to check the connections of the new names:\n   - Max has no connections listed beyond Sara and Ian, who we have already considered.\n   - Pam is connected to Puja.\n5. Check Puja's connections:\n   - Puja is connected to Amir.\n6. Amir is connected to Moin.\n\nThis gives us the shortest path from Raj to Moin. \n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Pam, Puja, Amir, Moin"
