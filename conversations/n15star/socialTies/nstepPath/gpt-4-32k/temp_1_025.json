Next, let's explore the connections of the students connected to Vivian and see if any of them are connected to Ajit:\n   - Salma is connected to Shanshan and Vadim, but not to Ajit.\n   - Shanshan is connected to Salma, Vadim, and Noah, but not to Ajit.\n   - Vadim is connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Noah, but not to Ajit.\n   - Gongxue is connected to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice, but not to Ajit.\n3. Now, let's explore the connections of the students who are connected to the students connected to Vivian:\n   - Salma and Vadim's connections have already been explored.\n   - Shanshan's connection Noah is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha, but not to Ajit.\n   - Gongxue's connections include Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice. Among them, Soheil is connected to Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Alice.\n4. So, the shortest connection path from Vivian to Ajit is through Gongxue and Soheil.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Ajit"
