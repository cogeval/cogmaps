Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n5. Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam\n6. Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max\n7. Reza: Moin, Pari\n8. Kim: Pam\n9. Ian: Sara, Max\n10. Moin: Pari\n11. Puja: Pam\n12. Sara: Max\n13. Pari: None\n14. Pam: None\n15. Max: None\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from Raj to Pari.\n\nStep 1: Start from Raj, who is directly connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nStep 2: From the list, we can see that none of Raj's direct connections are connected to Pari. So, we need to go one step further.\n\nStep 3: Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian is connected to Sara and Max. Sara is connected to Max. Kim is connected to Pam. None of these connections lead to Pari.\n\nStep 4: We can see that Amir and Jing are directly connected to Pari. So, we need to find a connection to either Amir or Jing. \n\nStep 5: We can see that Raj is connected to Nisha, and Nisha is connected to Ian, and Ian is connected to Sara, and Sara is connected to Max, and Max is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Pari.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Pari is: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing, Pari"
