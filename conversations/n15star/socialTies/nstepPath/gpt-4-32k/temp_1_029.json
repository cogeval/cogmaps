None of these are directly connected to Amir. We'll have to explore further connections. \n\n2. Sara and Max don't have any connection with Amir or his connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja). But Ian has a connection with Sara and Max. \n\n3. We know that Sara is connected to Max, but Max has no other connections. Therefore, our only option here is to follow the connection from Ian to Sara, then Sara to Max.\n\n4. Max, on the other hand, is also connected to Jing. And Jing is directly connected to Amir. So, the shortest path from Nisha to Amir would be Nisha - Ian - Sara - Max - Jing - Amir. \n\nThis path involves 5 steps, which seems to be the most efficient way based on the given information. \n\nWe've carefully evaluated all connections, and it's clear that there is no shorter path from Nisha to Amir.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing, Amir"
