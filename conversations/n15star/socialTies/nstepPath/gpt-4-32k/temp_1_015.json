Puja, in turn, is connected to Pam. Let's see if Pam has a connection to Jing:\n\n- Pam --> No connections to other scholars\n\nUnfortunately, Pam does not have any connections leading to Jing. Therefore, we need to backtrack and find a different path from Wim to Jing.\n\nThe remaining connection to Jing from Wim's network is through Reza who can be reached from Wim's connection to Wei. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, and Moin is connected to Pari. Moin is also connected to Jing. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wim to Jing is: Wim - Wei - Reza - Moin - Jing\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei, Reza, Moin, Jing"
