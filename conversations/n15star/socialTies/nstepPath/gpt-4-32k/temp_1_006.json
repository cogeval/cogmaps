First, let's list the connections between students:\n- Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n- Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n- Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n- Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n- Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n- Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n- Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n- Soheil, Alice\n- Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n- Shanshan, Vadim\n- Gongxue, Alice\n- Ajit, Anisha\n\n2. We need to find a path connecting Vivian and Ajit with the least number of students in between. Let's analyze the connections.\n\n3. Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n\n4. Among Vivian's connections, Salma and Shanshan are connected to Vadim. Vadim is also directly connected to Vivian. Gongxue is connected to Alice.\n\n5. Checking the connections related to Ajit, we see that Ajit is connected to Durga, Anisha, and Soheil.\n\n6. Soheil is the common student who is connected to both Vivian (through Gongxue) and Ajit.\n\n7. The shortest path is: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Ajit.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Ajit"
