Amir is connected to Puja, but Puja is not connected to Kim. Reza and Moin do not have a direct or secondary connection to Kim.\n\n3. Next, look at the connections of the scholars that Amir, Reza, and Moin are connected to. Amir is also connected to Puja and Puja is connected to Pam. Pam is finally connected to Kim.\n\n4. Therefore, the shortest path from Pari to Kim would be Pari, Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim."
