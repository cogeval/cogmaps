Starting with Moin, who is connected to Pari and Reza.\n2. Neither Pari nor Reza is directly connected to Raj, so I'll need to find an intermediary scholar who has a connection to Raj.\n3. As I trace the connections, Reza has no further connections that can lead us to Raj. But Pari is connected to Jing.\n4. Jing is also not connected to Raj, but Jing is connected to Max.\n5. Max is connected to Sara, who is finally connected to Raj.\n\nCombining the steps above, the shortest path from Moin to Raj is: Moin, Pari, Jing, Max, Sara, Raj. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Jing, Max, Sara, Raj."
