Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari and Reza.\n\nFrom these connections, we can see that none of them are directly connected to Raj. So, we need to go one step further.\n\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari, but none of them are connected to Raj. Puja is connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to Raj. Max is connected to Sara and Ian, and Ian is connected to Raj.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Pari to Raj is: Pari - Jing - Max - Ian - Raj.\n\nAnswer: Pari, Jing, Max, Ian, Raj."
