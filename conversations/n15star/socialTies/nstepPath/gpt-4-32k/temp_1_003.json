Since none of these people are directly connected to Raj, we need to find out who they are connected to. \n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, Moin is connected to Pari, Pari is not connected to anyone else, and Puja is connected to Pam.\n5. None of these connections lead to Raj, so we move to the next level. \n6. Wim and Kim are both connected to Puja, and Kim is also connected to Pam. Wim, Kim and Pam are not directly connected to Raj.\n7. But, Kim is indirectly connected to Raj through Pam.\n8. So, the shortest path from Amir to Raj is: Amir -> Puja -> Kim -> Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim, Raj"
