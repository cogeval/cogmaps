Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nStep 3: Check the connections of Ian, Sara, and Max to find a connection to Puja. Neither of them is directly connected to Puja. \n\nStep 4: Check the second degree connections. Ian is connected to Sara and Max. Sara is connected to Max. Max has no further connections listed.\n\nStep 5: Since there's no direct or second degree connection to Puja, check the third degree connections. Sara is connected to Max. Max is not connected to anyone else. However, Ian is also connected to Sara, who is connected to Max.\n\nStep 6: Check the connections of the people connected to Max. Max is only connected to Jing. \n\nStep 7: Check the connections of Jing. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n\nStep 8: None of Jing's connections lead to Puja. However, Jing is connected to Reza.\n\nStep 9: Check Reza's connections. Reza is connected to Amir, Moin, and Pari.\n\nStep 10: Check Amir's connections. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 11: Puja is found in Amir's connections.\n\nStep 12: Trace back the connections from Puja to Nisha. The shortest path from Nisha to Puja is Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing, Reza, Amir, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing, Reza, Amir, Puja."
