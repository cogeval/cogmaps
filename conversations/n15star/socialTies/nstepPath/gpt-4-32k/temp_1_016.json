Starting from Wei, the connected scholars are Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Matt, so we will need to look at their connections:\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Pam doesn't have any known connections.\n3. Looking further, Kim's and Puja's connections (Pam) don't provide a path to Matt either. As such, it appears that no path exists from Wei to Matt based on the given connections.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from Wei to Matt."
