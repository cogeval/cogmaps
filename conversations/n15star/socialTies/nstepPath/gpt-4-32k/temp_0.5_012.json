Wim is not directly connected to Ian. Wei is not directly connected to Ian. Pam is not directly connected to Ian.\n\nHowever, Wim is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Ian. Therefore, the shortest path from Puja to Ian is through Wim and Kim.\n\nSo the shortest path from Puja to Ian is: Puja, Wim, Kim, Ian. \n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim, Kim, Ian."
