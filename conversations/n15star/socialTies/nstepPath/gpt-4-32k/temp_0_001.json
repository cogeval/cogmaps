Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n4. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n5. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n6. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n7. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam.\n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n10. Moin is connected to Pari.\n11. Puja is connected to Pam.\n12. Sara is connected to Max.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Ian, we need to find the least number of connections between them. \n\nStarting from Amir, the shortest path seems to be:\n\nAmir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Raj -> Ian\n\nThis path includes 5 connections, which seems to be the shortest possible path.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Ian is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Ian. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim, Raj, Ian."
