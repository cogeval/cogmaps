Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n4. Moin is connected to Pari and Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n\nNone of these scholars are directly connected to Raj.

Max is connected to Jing, Nisha, Ian, and Sara.\n8. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n9. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n10. Ian is connected to Sara, Max, and Raj.\n11.
