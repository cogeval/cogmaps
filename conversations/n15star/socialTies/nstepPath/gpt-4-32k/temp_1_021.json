Wim is connected to Wei, Puja, and Pam but also doesn't provide a new connection. Pam is only connected to Kim and Puja. Therefore, Pam is our best next step as she leads us to Puja. \n\n3. Now we are at Puja. Puja is connected to Amir and Wim. Wim doesn't provide any new connections, so let's go to Amir.\n\n4. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari. Out of these scholars, Reza is connected to Jing. Therefore, the shortest path from Kim to Jing is through Pam, Puja, Amir, and Reza. \n\nAnswer: Kim, Pam, Puja, Amir, Reza, Jing."
