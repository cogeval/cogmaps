Pari is connected with Amir, Jing. But none of them is directly connected to Kim.\n\nTherefore, I need to go another level deeper. Amir is connected with Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Jing is connected with Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Puja is connected with Pam, Wim, Amir, and Wei.\n\nPam is directly connected to Kim, Wei is directly connected to Kim. So the shortest paths from Reza to Kim go through either Amir, Puja, Pam, and Kim or Jing, Puja, Pam, and Kim.\n\nTo summarise, the shortest path from Reza to Kim would be either Reza, Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim or Reza, Jing, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n \nAnswer: Reza, Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim or Reza, Jing, Puja, Pam, Kim"
