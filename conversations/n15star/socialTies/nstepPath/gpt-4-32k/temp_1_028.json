Next, identify possible connections from the initial connections to Ajit:\n   - Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim\n   - Shanshan -> Vadim\n   - Vadim\n   - Gongxue -> Alice\n\n3. Finally, identify the connection path from the second step connections to Ajit:\n   - Shanshan -> Vadim -> Noah -> Salma -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit\n   - Vadim -> Noah -> Salma -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit\n   - Gongxue -> Alice -> Solomon -> Soheil -> Pierre -> Abdul -> Durga -> Ajit\n\n4. Compare the lengths of the connection paths and determine the shortest one:\n   - Path 1: 7 connections\n   - Path 2: 6 connections\n   - Path 3: 7 connections\n\n5. The shortest connection path from Vivian to Ajit is through Path 2.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Vadim, Noah, Salma, Abdul, Durga, Ajit"
