Wim is directly connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n4. Wei is directly connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n5. Pam is directly connected to Wim, Wei, and Puja.\n6. Kim is directly connected to Wim, Wei, and Pam.\n7. Reza, Moin, and Pari are directly connected to Amir and Jing.\n8. Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n9. Max is directly connected to Jing, Nisha, Ian, and Sara.\n10. Nisha is directly connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n11. Ian is directly connected to Nisha, Sara, and Max.\n12. Sara is directly connected to Nisha, Ian, and Max.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the shortest path from Puja to Ian is:\n\nPuja -> Wim -> Kim -> Raj -> Ian\n\nSo, the scholar names in order are Puja, Wim, Kim, Raj, Ian. \n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim, Kim, Raj, Ian"
