Start with Puja.\n2. Check if Puja is connected to Moin. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Answer: Puja, Moin.\n3. If not, check all the scholars directly connected to Puja: Pam. Since Pam is not Moin, we move to the next step.\n4. Check the scholars directly connected to Pam: Kim. Since Kim is not Moin, we move to the next step.\n5. Check the scholars directly connected to Kim: Wei. Since Wei is not Moin, we move to the next step.\n6. Check the scholars directly connected to Wei: Puja. Since Puja is already visited, we skip it.\n7. Check the scholars directly connected to Wei: Pam. Since Pam is not Moin, we move to the next step.\n8. Check the scholars directly connected to Pam: Kim. Since Kim is already visited, we skip it.\n9. Check the scholars directly connected to Pam: Puja. Since Puja is already visited, we skip it.\n10. Check the scholars directly connected to Kim: Wei. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n11. Check the scholars directly connected to Kim: Pam. Since Pam is already visited, we skip it.\n12. Continue this process until we find Moin.\n\nBased on the given information, there is no direct connection between Puja and Moin. Therefore, we cannot find a path from Puja to Moin.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from Puja to Moin."
