Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue and call it current_scholar.\n   - If current_scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to current_scholar that has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and keep track of its parent (the scholar from which it was reached).\n4. If the algorithm reaches this step, there is no path from Wim to Raj.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n   - Queue: Wim\n   - Visited: Wim\n   - Parent of Wim: None\n\n2. Dequeue Wim.\n   - Queue: Empty\n   - Visited: Wim\n   - Parent of Wim: None\n\n3. Wim is not Raj and has the following connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Enqueue Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Queue: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Visited: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Parent of Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam: Wim\n\n4. Dequeue Wei.\n   - Queue: Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Visited: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Parent of Wei: Wim\n\n5. Wei is not Raj and has the following connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Enqueue Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Queue: Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Visited: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Parent of Kim, Puja, and Pam: Wei\n\n6. Dequeue Kim.\n   - Queue: Puja, Pam\n   - Visited: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Parent of Kim: Wei\n\n7. Kim is connected to Raj.\n   - Found the shortest path from Wim to Raj.\n   - The shortest path is: Wim, Wei, Kim, Raj\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei, Kim, Raj"
