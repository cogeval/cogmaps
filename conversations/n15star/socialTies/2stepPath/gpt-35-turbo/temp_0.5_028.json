Start with Nisha.\n2. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n3. Ian is not connected to Kim, so we move on.\n4. Sara is not connected to Kim, so we move on.\n5. Max is not connected to Kim, so we move on.\n6. Now, we move to the scholars connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n7. Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n8. Sara is not connected to Kim, so we move on.\n9. Max is connected to Sara.\n10. Sara is connected to Kim.\n11.
