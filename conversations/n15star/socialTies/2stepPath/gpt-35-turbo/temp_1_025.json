Start with Raj as the initial vertex.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited vertices.\n4. Create an empty path list to store the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a vertex from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued vertex is Wim, we have found the shortest path. Add Wim to the path list and break the loop.\n   - If the dequeued vertex is not in the visited set:\n     - Add the dequeued vertex to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue all the adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex that are not in the visited set.\n     - Create a dictionary to store the parent of each adjacent vertex, where the parent is the dequeued vertex.\n6. Construct the shortest path by backtracking from Wim to Raj using the parent dictionary.\n7. Reverse the path list to get the shortest path from Raj to Wim.\n\nNow, let's apply the algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Start with Raj as the initial vertex.\nStep 2: Enqueue Raj. Queue: Raj\nStep 3: Mark Raj as visited.\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Raj. Queue: Empty, Visited: Raj\nStep 6: Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Queue: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Nisha. Queue: Ian, Sara, Kim, Visited: Raj, Nisha\nStep 6: Enqueue Ian, Sara, and Max. Queue: Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Ian. Queue: Sara, Kim, Max, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian\nStep 6: Enqueue Sara and Max. Queue: Sara, Kim, Max\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Sara. Queue: Kim, Max, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara\nStep 6: Enqueue Max. Queue: Kim, Max\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Kim. Queue: Max, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nStep 6: Enqueue Pam. Queue: Max, Pam\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Max. Queue: Pam, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\nStep 6: Enqueue Puja. Queue: Pam, Puja\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Pam. Queue: Puja, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam\nStep 6: Enqueue Puja. Queue: Puja\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: Dequeue Puja. Queue: Empty, Visited: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam, Puja\nStep 4: Check the queue.\nStep 5: No vertices left in the queue.\nStep 6: Backtrack from Wim to Raj using the parent dictionary: Wim -> Wei -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Ian -> Nisha -> Raj\nStep 7: Reverse the path list: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Pam, Puja, Wei, Wim\n\nThe shortest path from Raj to Wim is: Answer: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Pam, Puja, Wei, Wim"
