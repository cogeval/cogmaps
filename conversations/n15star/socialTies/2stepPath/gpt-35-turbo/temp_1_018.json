Check if Kim is connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Kim -> Puja.\n3. If not, check if any of Kim's connections are connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Kim -> [connection] -> Puja.\n4. If not, check if any of Kim's connections have any connections that are connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Kim -> [connection1] -> [connection2] -> Puja.\n5. Repeat this process until we find a path from Kim to Puja.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Kim is connected to Puja directly, so the shortest path is Kim -> Puja.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Puja"
