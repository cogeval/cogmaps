If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Amir.\n3. If Wim is not directly connected to Amir, we need to explore the connections of Wim's connections.\n4. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. We will explore these connections one by one.\n5. First, check if Wei is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Wei, and Amir.\n6. If Wei is not connected to Amir, we need to explore Wei's connections.\n7. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Check if any of these connections are connected to Amir.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Amir.\n9. Puja is connected to Pam, but neither of them is connected to Amir.\n10. Pam is not connected to Amir either.\n11. Next, check if Kim is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Wei, Kim, and Amir.\n12. Kim is not connected to Amir, so we need to explore Kim's connections.\n13. Kim is connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to Amir.\n14. Finally, check if Puja is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Wei, Puja, and Amir.\n15. Puja is not connected to Amir, so we have explored all possible paths from Wim to Amir.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Amir is Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Amir"
