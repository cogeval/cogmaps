If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Raj.\n3. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Raj. In this case, Wei is connected to Kim, who is directly connected to Raj. So the shortest path is Wei, Kim, Raj.\n4.

In this case, Wei is connected to Puja, who is connected to Pam, who is directly connected to Raj. So the shortest path is Wei, Puja, Pam, Raj.\n5.
