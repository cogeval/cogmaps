Check Nisha's connections: Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n3. Add Ian, Sara, and Max to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Ian.\n5. Check Ian's connections: Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n6. Add Sara and Max to the queue.\n7. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Sara.\n8. Check Sara's connections: Sara is connected to Max.\n9. Add Max to the queue.\n10. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Max.\n11. Check Max's connections: Max is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n12. Since Nisha is already visited, skip it.\n13. Since Ian and Sara are already visited, skip them.\n14. Add Kim to the queue.\n15. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Kim.\n16. Check Kim's connections: Kim is connected to Pam.\n17. Add Pam to the queue.\n18. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Pam.\n19. Check Pam's connections: Pam is connected to Puja.\n20. Add Puja to the queue.\n21. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Puja.\n22. Check Puja's connections: Puja is connected to Reza, Moin, Kim, and Pam.\n23. Since Reza, Moin, and Kim are already visited, skip them.\n24. Add Pam to the queue.\n25. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Pam.\n26. Check Pam's connections: Pam is connected to Kim.\n27. Since Kim is already visited, skip it.\n28. The next scholar in the queue is Jing, but Jing is not connected to Nisha.\n29. Continue the breadth-first search until Jing is found or the queue is empty.\n\nThe shortest path from Nisha to Jing is: Nisha, Max, Kim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Max, Kim, Jing"
