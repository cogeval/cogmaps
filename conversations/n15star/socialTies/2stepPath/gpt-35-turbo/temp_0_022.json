If yes, the shortest path is Pam, Raj.\n3. If not, check if Pam is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, the directly connected scholar, Raj.\n4. If not, check if Pam is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Raj. Repeat this step until a connection to Raj is found.\n5. If no connection to Raj is found, there is no path from Pam to Raj.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Pam is connected to Puja.\n2. Puja is connected to Wei, Kim, and Pam. None of them are directly connected to Raj.\n3. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. None of them are directly connected to Raj.\n4. Kim is connected to Pam. Pam is directly connected to Raj.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Kim, Raj"
