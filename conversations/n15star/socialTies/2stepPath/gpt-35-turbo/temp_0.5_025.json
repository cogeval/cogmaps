Check Raj's connections: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n3. Check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n4. Check Ian's connections: Sara and Max.\n5. Check Sara's connections: Max.\n6. Check Max's connections: None.\n7. Backtrack to Sara and check her remaining connections: None.\n8. Backtrack to Ian and check his remaining connections: None.\n9. Backtrack to Nisha and check her remaining connections: None.\n10. Check Kim's connections: Pam.\n11. Check Pam's connections: None.\n12. Backtrack to Kim and check her remaining connections: None.\n13. Check Wim's connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n14. Since Kim is already visited, we have found the shortest path from Raj to Wim: Raj, Kim, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Wim"
