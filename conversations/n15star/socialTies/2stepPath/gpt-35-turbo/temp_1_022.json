Then, we'll move to their connections and continue exploring until we reach Raj.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n1. Start at Pam.\n2. Pam is connected to Kim, so we'll explore Kim next.\n3. Kim is connected to Wei, Puja, and Pam (already visited). We'll explore Wei and Puja next.\n4. Wei is connected to Kim (already visited), Puja (already visited), so we'll skip.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam (already visited), Kim (already visited), and Wim (not visited yet). We'll explore Wim next.\n6. Wim is connected to Wei (already visited), Kim (already visited), Puja (already visited), and Pam (already visited). We'll skip.\n7. There are no more unvisited connections from Pam, so we move to the next level.\n8. Kim is already visited, so we move to the next level.\n9. Wei is already visited, so we move to the next level.\n10. Puja is already visited, so we move to the next level.\n11. Wim is already visited, so we move to the next level.\n12. Reza is connected to Moin, Pari (already visited), and Amir (not visited yet). We'll explore Amir next.\n13. Amir is connected to Reza (already visited), Moin (already visited), Pari (already visited), and Puja (already visited). We'll skip.\n14. There are no more unvisited connections from Pam, so we move to the next level.\n15. Moin is connected to Reza (already visited), Pari (already visited), and Jing (not visited yet). We'll explore Jing next.\n16. Jing is connected to Reza (already visited), Moin (already visited), Pari (already visited), and Max (not visited yet). We'll explore Max next.\n17. Max is connected to Nisha, Sara (already visited), and Ian (already visited). We'll explore Nisha next.\n18. Nisha is connected to Ian (already visited), Sara (already visited), and Raj (not visited yet). We've reached Raj, so we can stop here.\n\nThe shortest path from Pam to Raj is: Pam, Puja, Reza, Moin, Jing, Max, Nisha, Raj.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Puja, Reza, Moin, Jing, Max, Nisha, Raj."
