Start with Moin as the starting node and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Moin to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Puja, the shortest path has been found. Stop the search.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Puja has not been found, there is no path from Moin to Puja.\n\nUsing the given connections, here is the shortest path from Moin to Puja: Moin -> Pari -> Puja.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Puja"
