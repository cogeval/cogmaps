Check if Moin is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Puja.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections: Reza and Pari.\n4. Check if Reza is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Reza, Puja.\n5. If not, check Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n6. Check if Pari is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Moin, Pari, Puja.\n7. If not, check Pari's connections: Moin.\n8. Since Pari is not directly connected to Puja, we need to explore further.\n9. Check Moin's connections: Reza.\n10. Check Reza's connections: Moin.\n11. Since we have already visited Moin and Reza, we can skip them to avoid loops.\n12. Check Pari's connections: Moin.\n13. Since we have already visited Moin, we can skip it to avoid loops.\n14.
