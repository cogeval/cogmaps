If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Wei.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection to Wei.\n5. If not, move to the next level of connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Check if any of the connections from step 5 are directly connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection from step 5, and then Wei.\n7. If not, continue this process, moving to the next level of connections until Wei is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to Wei is:\n\nAmir, Puja, Wei\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wei"
