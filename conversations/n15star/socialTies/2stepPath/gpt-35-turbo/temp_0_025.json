Create a queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create a visited set and add Raj to it.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Wim, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Raj to Wim.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Raj.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Mark Raj as visited.\n4. Dequeue Raj.\n5. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n6. Mark Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim as visited.\n7. Dequeue Nisha.\n8. Nisha is not Wim and is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Enqueue Ian, Sara, and Max.\n9. Mark Ian, Sara, and Max as visited.\n10. Dequeue Ian.\n11. Ian is not Wim and is connected to Sara and Max. Enqueue Sara and Max.\n12. Mark Sara and Max as visited.\n13. Dequeue Sara.\n14. Sara is not Wim and is connected to Max. Enqueue Max.\n15. Mark Max as visited.\n16. Dequeue Max.\n17. Max is not Wim and is not connected to any other scholars.\n18. Dequeue Kim.\n19. Kim is not Wim and is connected to Pam. Enqueue Pam.\n20. Mark Pam as visited.\n21. Dequeue Pam.\n22. Pam is not Wim and is not connected to any other scholars.\n23. Dequeue Wim.\n24. Wim is the destination. Stop the algorithm.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Kim, Pam, Wim"
