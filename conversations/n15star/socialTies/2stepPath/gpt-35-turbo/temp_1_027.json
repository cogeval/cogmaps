Start with Raj as the starting point and create an empty queue.\n2. Add Raj to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Pam. If it is, stop and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar (based on the given connections) if they haven't been visited before. Also, keep track of the path from the starting scholar to each connected scholar.\n4. If the queue becomes empty without finding Pam, there is no path from Raj to Pam.\n\nUsing the given connections, let's find the shortest path from Raj to Pam:\n\n1. Start: Raj (Path: Raj)\n2. Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim (Path: Raj, Nisha), (Path: Raj, Ian), (Path: Raj, Sara), (Path: Raj, Kim)\n3. Dequeue Nisha (Path: Raj, Nisha)\n   - Enqueue Ian, Sara, Max (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian), (Path: Raj, Nisha, Sara), (Path: Raj, Nisha, Max)\n4. Dequeue Ian (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian)\n   - Enqueue Sara, Max (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara), (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Max)\n5. Dequeue Sara (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara)\n   - Enqueue Max (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max)\n6. Dequeue Max (Path: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max)\n   - No more connected scholars to enqueue.\n7. Dequeue Kim (Path: Raj, Kim)\n   - Enqueue Puja, Pam (Path: Raj, Kim, Puja), (Path: Raj, Kim, Pam)\n8. Dequeue Puja (Path: Raj, Kim, Puja)\n   - Enqueue Pam (Path: Raj, Kim, Puja, Pam)\n9. Dequeue Pam (Path: Raj, Kim, Puja, Pam)\n   - Stop, shortest path found!\n\nAnswer: Raj, Kim, Puja, Pam"
