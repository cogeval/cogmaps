If yes, the shortest path is Pam, the connecting scholar, Amir.\n5. If not, check the connections of Pam's connections: Kim, Puja, Pam (already visited), Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam (already visited).\n6. Repeat step 4 for each of the connections until Amir is found.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Pam to Amir is:\n\nPam, Puja, Amir\n\nAnswer: Pam, Puja, Amir"
