Start with Reza as the starting point.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create a visited set and add Reza to it.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Matt, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n5. If we reach this step, it means there is no path from Reza to Matt.\n\nFollowing these steps, let's find the shortest path from Reza to Matt:\n\n1. Start with Reza.\n2. Enqueue Reza and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue Reza.\n4. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but they are already visited.\n5. Reza is not connected to Matt, so we continue to the next scholar.\n6. Reza is connected to Pari, but Pari is already visited.\n7. Reza is not connected to Matt, so we continue to the next scholar.\n8. Reza is connected to Puja, but Puja is already visited.\n9. Reza is not connected to Matt, so we continue to the next scholar.\n10. Reza is connected to Pam, but Pam is already visited.\n11. Reza is not connected to Matt, so we continue to the next scholar.\n12. Reza is not connected to any unvisited scholars.\n13. The queue is empty, and we have not found a path to Matt.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Reza to Matt."
