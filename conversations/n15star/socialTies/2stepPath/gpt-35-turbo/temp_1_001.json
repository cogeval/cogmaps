Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is Wim. If yes, the shortest path has been found. Return the path.\n   - If not, check the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - Enqueue the unvisited connected scholars and mark them as visited.\n   - Update the path with the current scholar.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and Wim has not been found, there is no path from Amir to Wim.\n\nUsing the given connections, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Wim:\n\n1. Start with Amir and enqueue Amir.\n2. Dequeue Amir. The scholars connected to Amir are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Mark Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja as visited.\n   - Update the path with Amir.\n3. Dequeue Reza. The scholars connected to Reza are Moin and Pari.\n   - Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n   - Mark Moin and Pari as visited.\n   - Update the path with Reza.\n4. Dequeue Moin. Moin is not connected to any other scholars.\n5. Dequeue Pari. Pari is not connected to any other scholars.\n6. Dequeue Puja. The scholars connected to Puja are Pam and Kim.\n   - Enqueue Pam and Kim.\n   - Mark Pam and Kim as visited.\n   - Update the path with Puja.\n7. Dequeue Pam. Pam is connected to Kim.\n   - Enqueue Kim.\n   - Mark Kim as visited.\n   - Update the path with Pam.\n8. Dequeue Kim. Kim is connected to Wei, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Enqueue Wei.\n   - Mark Wei as visited.\n   - Update the path with Kim.\n9. Dequeue Wei. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Enqueue Wim.\n   - Mark Wim as visited.\n   - Update the path with Wei.\n10. Wim has been found. The shortest path from Amir to Wim is: Amir, Puja, Kim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim, Wei"
