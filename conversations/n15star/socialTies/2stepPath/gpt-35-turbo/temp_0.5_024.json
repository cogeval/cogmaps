Sara is connected to Max.\n\nSince Matt is not directly connected to any of the scholars mentioned, we need to find a connection between Max and Matt. From the given information, we can see that Max is connected to Jing and Nisha, and Nisha is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Matt.\n\nBased on this information, the shortest path from Raj to Matt would be:\n\nRaj, Nisha, Ian, Matt\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Matt"
