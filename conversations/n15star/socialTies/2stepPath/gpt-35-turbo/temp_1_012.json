Max is connected to Nisha. (Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Max -> Nisha)\n6. Nisha is connected to Ian. (Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Max -> Nisha -> Ian)\n7. Ian is connected to Reza. (Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Max -> Nisha -> Ian -> Reza)\n8. Reza is connected to Moin. (Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Max -> Nisha -> Ian -> Reza -> Moin)\n9. Moin is connected to Pari.
