Let's check their connections:\n\nPari is connected to Moin.\nReza is connected to Moin, Pari, and Amir.\nAmir is not connected to Matt.\n\nPari has already been visited, and we cannot find a connection from Reza or Pari to Matt. Therefore, there is no path from Moin to Matt based on the given connections.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Moin to Matt."
