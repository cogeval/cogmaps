If yes, the shortest path is Puja, Reza.\n3. If not, check Puja's connections: Pam, Kim, Wei, Wim, and Amir.\n4. Check if any of Puja's connections are connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Puja, the connecting scholar, Reza.\n5. If not, check the connections of Puja's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Reza is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Puja to Reza is: Puja, Kim, Wei, Wim, Amir, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Kim, Wei, Wim, Amir, Reza"
