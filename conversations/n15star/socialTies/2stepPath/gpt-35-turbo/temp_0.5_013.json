Puja is connected to Wim, Reza, and Wei. Explore each of these connections in the next steps.\n3. Explore Wim's connections: Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is the target scholar, so we have found the shortest path.\n4. The shortest path from Puja to Kim is: Puja, Wim, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Wim, Kim"
