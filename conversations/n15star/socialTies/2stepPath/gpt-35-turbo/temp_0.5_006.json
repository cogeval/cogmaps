Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Puja, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the path dictionary with the current scholar as the key.\n6. If we reach this point, it means there is no path from Moin to Puja.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Moin.\n2. Enqueue Moin.\n3. Mark Moin as visited.\n4. Path dictionary: {Moin: None}\n5. Queue: [Moin]\n\n6. Dequeue Moin.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n     - Pari has not been visited.\n     - Enqueue Pari.\n     - Mark Pari as visited.\n     - Path dictionary: {Moin: None, Pari: Moin}\n     - Queue: [Pari]\n\n7. Dequeue Pari.\n   - Pari is connected to Puja.\n     - Puja has not been visited.\n     - Enqueue Puja.\n     - Mark Puja as visited.\n     - Path dictionary: {Moin: None, Pari: Moin, Puja: Pari}\n     - Queue: [Puja]\n\n8. Dequeue Puja.\n   - Puja is the target scholar. Stop the search.\n\nThe shortest path from Moin to Puja is Moin, Pari, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Pari, Puja"
