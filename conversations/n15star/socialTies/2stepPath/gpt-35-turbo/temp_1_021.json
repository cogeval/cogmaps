Next, we check Pam's connections. Pam is connected to Wei and Puja.\n3. We continue checking the connections of Wei and Puja. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Puja is connected to Kim, Pam, and Wim.\n4. We mark Kim, Pam, Wei, and Puja as visited.\n5. We then check the connections of Sara. Sara is connected to Max, Ian, and Nisha.\n6. We continue checking the connections of Max, Ian, and Nisha. Max is connected to Jing, Reza, Moin, and Sara. Ian is connected to Nisha, Sara, and Max. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Raj.\n7. We mark Max, Ian, Nisha, Jing, Reza, Moin, and Raj as visited.\n8. Finally, we check the connections of Max, Ian, Nisha, Jing, Reza, Moin, and Raj. Max is already visited, Ian is already visited, Nisha is already visited, Jing is already visited, Reza is already visited, Moin is already visited, and Raj is already visited.\n9. The search ends here as we have found Sara in the visited nodes.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Kim to Sara is: Answer: Kim, Puja, Pam, Sara."
