Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Jing, we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n   - Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n4. Repeat step 3 until either we find Jing or the queue becomes empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps and find the shortest path from Amir to Jing:\n\n1. Start with Amir (visited).\n2. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Dequeue Reza (visited).\n4. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n5. Dequeue Moin (visited).\n6. Enqueue Pari.\n7. Dequeue Pari (visited).\n8. Enqueue Puja.\n9. Dequeue Puja (visited).\n10. Enqueue Wim (connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam).\n11. Enqueue Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n12. Dequeue Wei (visited).\n13. Enqueue Kim.\n14. Dequeue Kim (visited).\n15. Enqueue Pam.\n16. Dequeue Pam (visited).\n17. Enqueue Raj (connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim).\n18. Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim (visited).\n19. Enqueue Jing (connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max).\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Jing is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing"
