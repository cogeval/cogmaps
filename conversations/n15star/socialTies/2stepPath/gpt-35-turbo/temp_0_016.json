If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Raj.\n3. If not, check Wei's connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of Wei's connections are connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the connecting scholar, Raj.\n5. If not, check the connections of Wei's connections:\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Pam is not connected to Raj.\n6. Continue this process until we find a connection to Raj or exhaust all possible paths.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Wei to Raj is:\n\nWei, Kim, Pam, Raj\n\nAnswer: Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj"
