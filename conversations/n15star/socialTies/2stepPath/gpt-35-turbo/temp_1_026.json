We start at Raj and explore its connections, then move on to the connections of its connections, and so on, until we reach Wei.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the scholars to explore.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Enqueue Raj into the queue.\n4. Add Raj to the visited set.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Wei, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited connections of the dequeued scholar and add them to the visited set.\n6. If we have not found Wei, it means there is no path from Raj to Wei.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Wei:\n\n1. Queue: [Raj]\n2. Visited: {Raj}\n3. Dequeue Raj: Queue: []\n4. Raj's connections: [Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim]\n   - Enqueue Nisha: Queue: [Nisha]\n   - Enqueue Ian: Queue: [Nisha, Ian]\n   - Enqueue Sara: Queue: [Nisha, Ian, Sara]\n   - Enqueue Kim: Queue: [Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim]\n5. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim}\n6. Dequeue Nisha: Queue: [Ian, Sara, Kim]\n7. Nisha's connections: [Ian, Sara, Max]\n   - Enqueue Ian: Queue: [Ian, Sara, Kim, Max]\n   - Enqueue Sara: Queue: [Ian, Sara, Kim, Max]\n   - Enqueue Max: Queue: [Ian, Sara, Kim, Max]\n8. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max}\n9. Dequeue Ian: Queue: [Sara, Kim, Max]\n10. Ian's connections: [Sara, Max]\n    - Enqueue Sara: Queue: [Sara, Kim, Max]\n    - Enqueue Max: Queue: [Sara, Kim, Max]\n11. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max}\n12. Dequeue Sara: Queue: [Kim, Max]\n13. Sara's connections: [Max]\n    - Enqueue Max: Queue: [Kim, Max]\n14. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max}\n15. Dequeue Kim: Queue: [Max]\n16. Kim's connections: [Pam]\n    - Enqueue Pam: Queue: [Max, Pam]\n17. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam}\n18. Dequeue Max: Queue: [Pam]\n19. Max's connections: []\n    - No connections to enqueue.\n20. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam}\n21. Dequeue Pam: Queue: []\n22. Pam's connections: []\n    - No connections to enqueue.\n23. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam}\n24. Dequeue Max: Queue: []\n25. Max's connections: []\n    - No connections to enqueue.\n26. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam}\n27. Dequeue Pam: Queue: []\n28. Pam's connections: []\n    - No connections to enqueue.\n29. Visited: {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Pam}\n\nSince we have not found Wei in our search, there is no path from Raj to Wei.\n\nAnswer: No path from Raj to Wei."
