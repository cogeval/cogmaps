Check if Nisha is connected to Kim directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Kim.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n4. Check if any of Nisha's connections are connected to Kim. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, the connected scholar, Kim.\n5. If not, check the connections of Nisha's connections: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Kim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Nisha to Kim is:\n\nNisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim"
