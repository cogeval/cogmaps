Create an empty queue.\n3. Enqueue Nisha into the queue.\n4. Create an empty visited set.\n5. Add Nisha to the visited set.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Kim, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n7. If the queue becomes empty before finding Kim, there is no path from Nisha to Kim.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Nisha to Kim:\n\n1. Start with Nisha.\n2. Enqueue Nisha.\n3. Visit Nisha (add Nisha to the visited set).\n4. Dequeue Nisha.\n5. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Enqueue them.\n6. Visit Ian, Sara, and Max (add them to the visited set).\n7. Dequeue Ian.\n8. Ian is not connected to Kim.\n9. Dequeue Sara.\n10. Sara is connected to Max. Enqueue Max.\n11. Visit Max (add Max to the visited set).\n12. Dequeue Max.\n13. Max is connected to Nisha. Skip because Nisha is already visited.\n14. Dequeue Kim.\n15. Kim is found! Stop the algorithm.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Nisha to Kim is: Nisha, Sara, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Sara, Kim"
