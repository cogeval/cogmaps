If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Raj.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of Wim's connections are directly connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, the connecting scholar, and Raj.\n5. If not, continue to the next level of connections.\n6. From Wei, check his connections: Kim, Puja, and Pam. None of them are directly connected to Raj.\n7. From Kim, check his connections: Pam. Pam is directly connected to Raj, so the shortest path is Wim, Kim, Pam, and Raj.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Kim, Pam, Raj"
