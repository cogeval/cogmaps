From Puja, I can go to Amir or Wim, but neither of them are directly connected to Sara. Puja is also connected to Wei, but Wei is not connected to Sara either. So, I'll choose to go to Wim from Puja. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, and Pam, but none of them are connected to Sara. Therefore, I'll need to go back to Puja. From Puja, I can go to Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are connected to Sara. So, I'll go back to Puja. From Puja, I can go to Wim. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. None of them are connected to Sara. Therefore, I'll need to go back to Puja. From Puja, I'll go to Wei. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. None of them are connected to Sara. So, I'll go back to Puja. From Puja, I'll go to Pam. Pam is connected to Wim, Wei, Puja, and Kim. None of them are connected to Sara. So, I'll go back to Puja. From Puja, I'll go to Amir. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari and Reza. Pari is connected to Amir, Jing, Reza, and Moin. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Max is connected to Jing, Ian, Sara, and Nisha. Ian is connected to Max, Sara, and Nisha.
