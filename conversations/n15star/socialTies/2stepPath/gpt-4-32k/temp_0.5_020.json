From Pam, there are no further connections, so we go to Wei. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. From Puja, we can go to Pam or Amir. But Pam leads to a dead end and Amir is not directly connected to Ian, so we go back to Wei.\n4. From Wei, we can go to Wim, but Wim is not directly connected to Ian either. So, we go back to Kim.\n5. From Kim, we can go to Raj through the connection with Raj's friend Kim.\n6. From Raj, we can directly go to Ian.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Kim to Ian is Kim, Raj, Ian.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Raj, Ian"
