Puja is not directly connected to Pari or Reza.\n\nThird, let's identify the connections from Pari and Reza. Pari is directly connected to Moin and Reza. Reza is directly connected to Moin and Jing.\n\nFourth, let's see if Puja is directly connected to Jing. Puja is not directly connected to Jing.\n\nFifth, let's identify the connections from Jing. Jing is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n\nSixth, let's see if Puja is directly connected to Max. Puja is not directly connected to Max.\n\nSeventh, let's identify the connections from Max. Max is directly connected to Jing, Ian, Sara, and Nisha.\n\nEighth, let's see if Puja is directly connected to Ian, Sara, or Nisha. Puja is not directly connected to Ian, Sara, or Nisha.\n\nNinth, let's identify the connections from Ian, Sara, and Nisha. Ian is directly connected to Sara, Max, and Raj. Sara is directly connected to Max, Ian, and Raj. Nisha is directly connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nTenth, let's see if Puja is directly connected to Raj.
