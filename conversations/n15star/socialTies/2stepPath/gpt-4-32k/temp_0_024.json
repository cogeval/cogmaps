However, none of these scholars are directly connected to Matt. \n\nNext, I need to find out who among the scholars connected to Raj is indirectly connected to Matt. From the information given, I can see that Nisha is connected to Max, but there is no information about a connection to Matt. Ian is connected to Sara and Max, but again, there is no information about a connection to Matt. Sara is connected to Max, but there is no information about a connection to Matt. Kim is connected to Pam, but there is no information about a connection to Matt.\n\nFinally, I need to check the connections of the scholars who are connected to the scholars connected to Raj. However, there is no information given about a scholar named Matt. Therefore, it is impossible to find a path from Raj to Matt based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Information about Matt is not provided."
