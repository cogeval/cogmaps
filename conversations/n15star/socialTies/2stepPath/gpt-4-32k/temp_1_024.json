Therefore, without any connections listed, I can't find a path from Raj to Matt. \n\nAccording to the given data, it's impossible to find a path from Raj to Matt, as there's no information provided about Matt's connections.\n  \nTherefore, my final answer is: \n\nAnswer: Impossible to find a path from Raj to Matt."
