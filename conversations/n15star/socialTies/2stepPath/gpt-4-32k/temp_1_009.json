From the provided list, it is clear that Pari is directly connected to Amir, Jing, and Moin.\n\nNext, identify which of these scholars have connections that can bring you closer to Matt. None of these scholars are connected to Matt, so let's go through their connections:\n\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, and Puja.\n- Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, and Max.\n- Moin is connected to Reza and Pari.\n\nReza, Moin, Puja and Max are not Matt, so we need to go another step further. \n\n- Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n- Moin is connected to Pari.\n- Puja is connected to Pam.\n- Max is connected to Sara and Ian.\n\nWe don't have Matt among these connections. So we need to go further, to the next level.\n\n- Sara is connected to Ian and Max\n- Ian is connected to Sara and Max\n- Pam is not connected to anyone else\n\nMatt does not appear in these connections, either. Considering that all the connections were explored and Matt didn't appear, it can be inferred that Matt is not connected to any of the scholars mentioned.\n\nAnswer: No Path."
