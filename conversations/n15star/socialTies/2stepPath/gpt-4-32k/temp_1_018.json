Identify the groups of connections between students:\n   - Group 1: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n   - Group 2: Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 3: Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil\n   - Group 4: Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha\n   - Group 5: Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 6: Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Group 7: Salma, Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Group 8: Soheil, Alice\n   - Group 9: Durga, Ajit, Anisha\n   - Group 10: Shanshan, Vadim\n   - Group 11: Gongxue, Alice\n   - Group 12: Ajit, Anisha\n\n2. Start with Vivian and find the groups she belongs to:\n   - Group 1\n\n3. Determine the groups that have a connection to Group 1:\n   - Group 4: Salma and Shanshan are in both groups 1 and 4\n   - Group 7: Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are in both groups 1 and 7\n\n4. Determine the groups connected to Group 4:\n   - Group 6: Anisha is in both groups 4 and 6\n   - Group 9: Anisha is in both groups 4 and 9\n\n5. Determine the groups connected to Group 6 or Group 9:\n   - Group 3: Durga and Ajit are in both groups 3 and 6\n   - Group 5: Alice is in both groups 5 and 9\n\n6. Determine the groups connected to Group 3 or Group 5:\n   - Group 2: Soheil is in both groups 2 and 3\n   - Group 8: Alice is in both groups 5 and 8\n\n7. Paul is in Group 2.\n\nSo, the shortest connection path from Vivian to Paul is: Vivian (Group 1) -> Salma or Shanshan (Group 4) -> Anisha (Group 6) -> Durga or Ajit (Group 3) -> Soheil (Group 2) -> Paul.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Anisha, Durga, Soheil, Paul"
