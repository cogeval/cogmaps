None of Wei's connections (Kim, Puja, Pam) are directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 3: Check the connections of Wei's connections. \n- Kim is connected to Pam. \n- Puja is connected to Pam and Wim. \n- Pam has no further connections mentioned.\n\nStep 4: Check if any of these secondary connections are directly connected to Amir. Wim is not connected to Amir.\n\nStep 5: Check the connections of Wim (Wei's secondary connection). Wim is connected to Wei (already considered), Kim (already considered), Puja (already considered), and Pam (already considered).\n\nStep 6: Since none of these paths led to Amir, we need to go a step further. Check the connections of Puja again. Puja is connected to Pam and Wim (already considered), and Amir.\n\nStep 7: We have found a connection to Amir through Puja. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Wei to Amir is: Wei, Puja, Amir. \n\nAnswer: Wei, Puja, Amir."
