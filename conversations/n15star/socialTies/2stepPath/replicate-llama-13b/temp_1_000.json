There are a few things we have to notice:-\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item There can be only one connection between two people\n\\item We have to start with the person who knows Amir, and move in the order of people\n\\item When someone connects to another person, they must include all possible directions (I mean they must mention Amir, Reza, then Moin,...).
