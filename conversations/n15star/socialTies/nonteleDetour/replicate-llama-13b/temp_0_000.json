Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

When you take your time to do this, i will give you a 1 star, after doing this, i will give you 2 stars and finally after doing this properly i will give you 3 stars.
