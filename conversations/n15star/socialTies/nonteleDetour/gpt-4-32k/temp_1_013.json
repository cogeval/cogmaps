This remains the same from the previous question, Kim, who is donating 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Identify the new connections of Amir after the disagreement. Now, Amir is connected to Reza and Moin as he is no longer connected to Puja.\n\nStep 3: Identify if Kim is directly connected to Amir. This remains unchanged, Kim is not directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 4: Identify if any of Amir's connections are connected to Kim. Pari, who is now connected to Puja, is not among Amir's direct connections. Among Reza, Moin and Puja, none of them are directly connected to Kim. \n\nStep 5: We need to find a connection that links to Kim. From the list, Wim and Wei are connected to Kim. Wim is connected to Puja, but neither Amir nor any of his connections are linked to Wim. However, Wei is connected to Wim who is in turn connected to Puja. Checking Amir's connections, we see that Puja is connected to Pari. \n\nStep 6: To get to Kim, Amir needs to follow the path through Pari to Puja, then through Wim to Wei, and finally to Kim.\n\nStep 7: Combine the information to form the answer.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim"
