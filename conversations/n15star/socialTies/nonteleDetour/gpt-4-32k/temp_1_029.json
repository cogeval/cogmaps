Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Based on the information provided, Kim is the one who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's start from Amir and figure out the shortest path to reach Kim.\n\n1. First, look at the scholars who are directly connected to Amir. These are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Check if Kim is among these scholars. She is not.\n3. Now, go to the next level and see if Kim is directly connected to any of the scholars from the first level.\n4. Kim is connected to Puja and Wim. \n5. Hence the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be Amir - Puja - Kim or Amir - Wim - Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

First, look at the scholars who are directly connected to Amir. These are now Reza, Moin, and Pari.\n2. Since Kim is not directly connected to Amir, we look at the second level connections.\n3. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n4. Moin is connected to Pari and Reza.\n5. Pari is now connected to Puja. \n6. Puja is directly connected to Kim.\n7. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be Amir - Pari - Puja - Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari, Puja, Kim"
