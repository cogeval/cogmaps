Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n 13. Vivian, Anisha (new connection)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the connections to find the one with the most reward.\n 1. If we choose the first connection involving Vivian, we find that we have to exclude Gongxue since Vivian and Gongxue are not connected. So, the connection path would be Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim.\n 13. If we choose the new connection involving Vivian and Anisha, the connection path is Vivian, Anisha.\n\nStep 4: Find the connection path that yields the most reward by comparing the two options.\n- Connection 1: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim (4 students)\n- Connection 13: Vivian, Anisha (2 students)\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim"
