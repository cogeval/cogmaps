Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, Kim is the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 2: Determine the connections of Amir, which are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 3: Identify if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Kim. Wim and Wei are the only ones directly connected to Kim, but neither of them are directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 4: Wim and Wei are not directly connected to Amir, we need to check for secondary connections. Puja is connected to Amir and also to Wim.\n\nStep 5: Finally, from Wim, we can reach Kim. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim) from Amir is Amir -> Puja -> Wim -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim"

This is not the case.\n\nStep 4: Since neither Reza nor Moin are directly connected to Kim, look for indirect connections. Reza is connected to Moin, and Moin is connected to Pari.\n\nStep 5: Pari is now connected to Puja, who is connected to Wim, who is then connected to Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path to Kim from Amir is now Amir -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Wim -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Kim"
