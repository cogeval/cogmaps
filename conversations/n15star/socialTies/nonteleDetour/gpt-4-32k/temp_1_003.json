Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Now, find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books, which is Kim. \n\n3. Looking at the list, we can see that Amir is not directly connected to Kim.\n\n4. However, Amir is connected to Puja, and Puja is connected to Kim.\n\n5. So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir -> Puja -> Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
