Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. From those, Puja is connected to Kim. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Kim (the person who's donating the maximum number of books) is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nTherefore, the order of scholars from Amir to the person who's donating the maximum number of books is Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."
