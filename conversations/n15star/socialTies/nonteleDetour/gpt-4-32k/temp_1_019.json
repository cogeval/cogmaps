Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nFrom those, only Puja is connected to Kim. So the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nThus, the scholar names in order, starting from Amir, are Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."
