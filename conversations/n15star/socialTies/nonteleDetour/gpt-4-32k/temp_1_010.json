Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue, but Vivian and Anisha are now connected. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim, who are all connected to each other.\n2. Vivian is now connected to Anisha as well.\n\nConsidering the groups, I can create the following connections:\n\n1. Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Vadim\n2. Vivian -> Anisha\n\nNow, I will look at the connections of the students in these two paths:\n\nPath 1:\n- Salma is connected to Noah, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n- Shanshan is connected to Noah, Salma, and Vadim.\n- Vadim is connected to Noah, Salma, and Shanshan.\n\nPath 2:\n- Anisha is connected to Noah, Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n\nIn Path 1, Vivian can connect to Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim, who each have three unique connections, but since they all share the same connections, it doesn't provide additional connections to Vivian.\n\nIn Path 2, Vivian connects to Anisha, who is connected to four unique people. So, the most rewarding path for Vivian would be the connection through Anisha.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Anisha"
