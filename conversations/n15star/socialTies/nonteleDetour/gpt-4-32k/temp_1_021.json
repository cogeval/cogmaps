Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and you have been told that there is no connection between Vivian and Gongxue, but Vivian and Anisha are now connected. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Since Vivian is now connected to Anisha, she is also indirectly connected to the group containing Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha.\n\nStep 2: Identify the connections between the groups.\nThe connections between the two groups are Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most rewarding connections between the groups.\nSince the task doesn't specify any reward values, we can assume that each connection has an equal reward value. The most rewarding connection will be the one with the most connections, which is Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n\nStep 4: Create the connection path that yields the most reward.\nStarting from Vivian, the path that yields the most reward would include all connected students in the order they are mentioned.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Anisha"
