Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

He is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\nStep 3: Check the connections of each of Amir's connections to find a path to Kim.\nStep 4: Puja is connected to Kim.\nStep 5: The shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nSo, the list of scholars is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nNote: The prompt says \"remember that you can take books only from one person\" which means once Amir collects books from Kim, he cannot then collect books from another person, even if there is a connection. Since Kim is donating the maximum number of books, the shortest path to Kim is what we are interested in. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

He is now connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari.\nStep 3: Check the connections of each of Amir's connections to find a path to Kim.\nStep 4: None of Amir's direct connections are connected to Kim, so we need to check secondary connections.\nStep 5: Moin is connected to Pari, and Pari is now connected to Puja, who is connected to Kim.\nStep 6: So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is now through Moin, Pari, Puja. \n\nNote: The same condition of collecting books only from one person applies, so Amir would stop at Kim once he collects the books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin, Pari, Puja, Kim."
