Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. The person who is donating the maximum number of books is Kim (50 books). \n3. To get to Kim, we can trace back from Kim to find a connection with Amir.\n4. Looking at the connections, Kim is directly connected with Wim and Wei.\n5. Neither Wim nor Wei is directly connected to Amir, but Puja is connected to both Wim and Wei, and Amir is connected to Puja.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

Kim is directly connected with Wim and Wei.\n4. From Amir's connections, none have direct connections to Wim and Wei. \n5. Reza, one of Amir's connections, is connected to Moin. \n6.
