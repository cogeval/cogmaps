Check the scholars connected to Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books. None of them are, so we continue.\n4. Move to the next level of scholars connected to the previous level: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n5. Check if any of these scholars are donating the maximum number of books.
