Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

We will create a queue and enqueue the initial state.\n\n1. Dequeue the first state from the queue: (Amir, 0).\n2. Check if the current person has the maximum number of donated books.
