Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the distance of each scholar from Amir.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Set the distance of Amir as 0 and the path from Amir to Amir as an empty list.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path from Amir to the scholar.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar, if they have not been visited yet, enqueue them, mark them as visited, update their distance from Amir, and update their path from Amir.\n7.
