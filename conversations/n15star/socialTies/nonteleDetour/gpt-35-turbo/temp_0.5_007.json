Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (in this case, Kim with 50 books). If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   c. If not, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   d. Add the current scholar to the visited set.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the person donating the maximum number of books, there is no path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim:\n\n1. Enqueue Amir.\n2. Dequeue Amir. Amir is not donating the maximum number of books.\n3. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n4. Dequeue Reza. Reza is not donating the maximum number of books.\n5. Enqueue Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Dequeue Moin. Moin is not donating the maximum number of books.\n7. Enqueue Pari and Puja.\n8. Dequeue Pari. Pari is not donating the maximum number of books.\n9. Enqueue Puja.\n10. Dequeue Puja. Puja is not donating the maximum number of books.\n11. Enqueue Wim, Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n12. Dequeue Wim. Wim is not donating the maximum number of books.\n13. Enqueue Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n14. Dequeue Wei. Wei is not donating the maximum number of books.\n15. Enqueue Kim and Pam.\n16. Dequeue Kim. Kim is donating the maximum number of books (50).\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim"
