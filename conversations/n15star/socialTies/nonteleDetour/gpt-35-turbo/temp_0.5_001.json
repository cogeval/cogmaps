Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will also keep track of the maximum number of books donated by any scholar encountered so far.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books to 0 to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n4. Initialize a variable shortest_path to an empty list to store the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue and assign it to the variable current_scholar.\n   2. If the current_scholar has donated more books than max_books, update max_books and shortest_path.\n   3. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current_scholar who haven't been visited yet and mark them as visited.\n   4. Repeat steps 5.1-5.3 for each connected scholar.\n6. Return the shortest_path.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
