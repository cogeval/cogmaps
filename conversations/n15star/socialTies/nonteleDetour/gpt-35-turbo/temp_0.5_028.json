Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Among these scholars, we need to find the one who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we look at the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but they are not donating any books. Pari is also not donating any books. Puja is connected to Pam, who is not donating the maximum number of books.\n\nMoving on, we need to explore the connections of the remaining scholars. Reza, Moin, and Pari do not have any connections leading to scholars who are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nFinally, we look at the connections of Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, who is donating 10 books. Since Pam is donating the maximum number of books among all the scholars, we have found the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
