Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Start with Amir and add him to the queue and the visited set.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, store the number of books donated.\n   - Check if the scholar is connected to any other scholar who has not been visited.\n   - If yes, enqueue the connected scholars and mark them as visited.\n7.
