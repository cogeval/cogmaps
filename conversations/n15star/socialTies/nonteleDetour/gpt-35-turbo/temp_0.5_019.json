Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Otherwise, take the first name from the queue and check if they are donating the maximum number of books. If so, return the path from Amir to that person.\n5. If not, add all the connections of the current person to the queue and continue to the next name in the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a path is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
