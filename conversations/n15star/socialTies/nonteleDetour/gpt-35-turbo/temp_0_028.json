Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to a queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. If not, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any other scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nQueue: [Amir]\nPath: [Amir]\n\nStep 2: Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.
