Start with Amir.\n2. Check if any of the scholars connected to Amir (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja) are donating the maximum number of books. Since none of them are donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n3. Explore the scholars connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja (excluding Amir).\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Pari is not connected to any other scholar.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n4. Check if any of the scholars in the second level are donating the maximum number of books. Since none of them are donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n5. Explore the scholars connected to Moin, Pari, and Pam.\n   - Moin is not connected to any other scholar.\n   - Pari is not connected to any other scholar.\n   - Pam is not connected to any other scholar.\n6. Check if any of the scholars in the third level are donating the maximum number of books. Since none of them are donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n7. Explore the scholars connected to Pam.\n   - Pam is not connected to any other scholar.\n8. Check if Pam is donating the maximum number of books. Since Pam is not donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n9. Explore the scholars connected to Reza.\n   - Reza is not connected to any other scholar.\n10. Check if Reza is donating the maximum number of books. Since Reza is not donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n11. Explore the scholars connected to Pari.\n   - Pari is not connected to any other scholar.\n12. Check if Pari is donating the maximum number of books. Since Pari is not donating the maximum number of books, we continue to the next level.\n13. Explore the scholars connected to Puja.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n14. Check if Pam is donating the maximum number of books. Since Pam is donating the maximum number of books, we stop the search and the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
