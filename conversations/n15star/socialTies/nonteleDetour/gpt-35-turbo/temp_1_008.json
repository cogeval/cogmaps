Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Let's begin with Amir and explore the connections one by one. We will keep track of the number of books each person is donating as we traverse the graph.\n\nStarting with Amir:\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nNext, we move on to the connections of Puja:\n6. Pam is connected to Kim.\n7. Kim is connected to Wei, Puja, and Pam.\n\nContinuing, we explore the connections of Kim:\n8. Wei is connected to Puja and Pam.\n9. Puja has already been visited, so we skip it.\n10. Pam has already been visited, so we skip it.\n\nFinally, we check the connections of Wei:\n11. Puja has already been visited, so we skip it.\n12. Pam has already been visited, so we skip it.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections and determined that the person donating the maximum number of books is Max, who is connected to Sara and Ian.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Max, the person donating the maximum number of books, is: Amir, Puja, Kim, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim, Max"
