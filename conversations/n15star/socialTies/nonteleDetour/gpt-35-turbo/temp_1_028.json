Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, or Puja. \n   - If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books (Kim or Max).\n   - If yes, the search ends and we have found the shortest path.\n   - If no, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any other scholars.\n     - If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is empty or the person donating the maximum number of books is found.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max) is: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing, Max"
