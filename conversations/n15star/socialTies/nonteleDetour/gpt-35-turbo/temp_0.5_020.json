Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n4. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n5. Add Amir to the visited set.\n6. Create an empty path list to store the path from Amir to each node.\n7. Create a variable max_books and set it to 0 to keep track of the maximum number of books.\n8. Create a variable max_books_person to store the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n9. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than max_books, update max_books and max_books_person.\n   - If the scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path from Amir to the scholar.\n   - For each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar is not in the visited set:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n       - Update the path list for the connected scholar by appending the current scholar to its path.\n10.
