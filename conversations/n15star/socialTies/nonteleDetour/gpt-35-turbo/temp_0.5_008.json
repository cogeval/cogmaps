Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n3. Initialize a distance dictionary with Amir as the key and 0 as the value.\n4. Initialize a books dictionary with each scholar as the key and 0 as the value.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum, update the current maximum.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books, return the path from Amir to the scholar.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the scholar into the queue.\n       - Mark the scholar as visited.\n       - Update the distance dictionary with the distance from Amir to the scholar.\n       - Update the books dictionary with the number of books the scholar is donating.\n6.
