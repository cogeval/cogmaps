Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir and add him to the queue. Initialize an empty visited set.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n    b. Check if the scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the algorithm and output the path from Amir to this scholar.\n    c. If the scholar has not been visited, add him to the visited set and enqueue all his connected scholars.\n3. If the algorithm reaches this step, it means there is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given group:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir and add him to the queue.
