Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of these scholars in the following order: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n4. For Reza, the connections are Moin and Pari. For Moin, there is no new connection. For Pari, there is no new connection. For Puja, the connections are Pam, Wei, and Kim.\n5. For Puja's connections, Kim is donating the maximum number of books. However, since Kim is not directly connected to Puja, we need to check the connections of Kim.\n6. For Kim, the connection is Pam, and Pam is donating 0 books.\n7. Since Pam is not donating the maximum number of books, we need to continue searching. \n8. For Kim's connections, there are no more new connections.\n9. We have exhausted all possible paths, and the person donating the maximum number of books is still Kim.\n10. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
