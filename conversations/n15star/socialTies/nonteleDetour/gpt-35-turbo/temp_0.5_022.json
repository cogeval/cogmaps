Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books.\n3. If yes, add those scholars to a queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   - If not, check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any scholars who are donating books and have not been visited yet.\n   - If yes, add those scholars to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. If the queue becomes empty without finding the scholar donating the maximum number of books, return an empty path.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n   - Reza is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Add Moin and Pari to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. Dequeue Moin from the queue.\n   - Moin is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Add Pari to the queue (already visited).\n6. Dequeue Pari from the queue.\n   - Pari is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Pari is connected to Puja.\n   - Add Puja to the queue and mark her as visited.\n7. Dequeue Puja from the queue.\n   - Puja is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Stop the search and return the path: Amir, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja"
