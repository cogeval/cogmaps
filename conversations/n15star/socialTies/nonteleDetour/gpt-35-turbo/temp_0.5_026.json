Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin's connections: Pari.\n   - Pari's connections: None.\n   - Puja's connections: Pam.\n   - Pam's connections: None.\n4. Continue exploring the connections of each scholar until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Reza -> Moin -> Pari (Pari is donating 0 books).\n   - Puja -> Pam (Pam is donating 50 books, which is the maximum).\n5.
