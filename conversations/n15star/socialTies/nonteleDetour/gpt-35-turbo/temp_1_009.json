Pop Amir from the queue and check if he is donating the maximum number of books. Since Amir is not donating any books, we continue.\n3. Add Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja) to the queue. The queue becomes [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja].\n4. Pop Reza from the queue and check if he is donating the maximum number of books. Reza is not donating any books, so we continue.\n5. Add Reza's connections (Moin and Pari) to the queue. The queue becomes [Moin, Pari, Puja].\n6. Pop Moin from the queue and check if he is donating the maximum number of books. Moin is not donating any books, so we continue.\n7. Add Moin's connection (Pari) to the queue. The queue becomes [Pari, Puja].\n8. Pop Pari from the queue and check if she is donating the maximum number of books. Pari is not donating any books, so we continue.\n9.
