Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between them will be represented as edges.\n\nThe connections between the scholars are as follows:\n- Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n- Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n- Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n- Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max\n- Reza: Moin, Pari\n- Kim: Pam\n- Ian: Sara, Max\n- Moin: Pari\n- Puja: Pam\n- Sara: Max\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books (Max).\n\nWe will use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nStarting from Amir, the BFS algorithm will explore the neighboring scholars in a breadth-first manner, until it reaches Max.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Max:\n1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty visited list.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Add Amir to the visited list.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue (let's call it current_scholar).\n   - If current_scholar is Max, stop the algorithm and return the visited list.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of current_scholar (i.e., scholars connected to current_scholar), if the neighbor is not in the visited list:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited list.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Amir to Max.
