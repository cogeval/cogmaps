Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If they are, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   - Update the path by appending the current scholar to the previous path.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar is found who is donating the maximum number of books, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's execute these steps:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
