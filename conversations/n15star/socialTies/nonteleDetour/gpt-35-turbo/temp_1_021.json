Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also update the maximum number of books donated along the way. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each person. Set the initial shortest path for Amir as an empty list.\n4. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of books donated and the person who donated them.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, update the maximum number of books donated and the person who donated them if necessary.\n   c. Iterate through the connections of the current scholar.\n   d. For each connected scholar, check if they have been visited before. If not, enqueue them into the queue, add them to the visited set, and update their shortest path from Amir.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the answer:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Max"
