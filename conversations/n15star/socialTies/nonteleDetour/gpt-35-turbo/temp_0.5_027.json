Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars.\n2. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add him to the visited set.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n5. Initialize a variable to keep track of the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n   c. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person donating them.\n   d. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who are not in the visited set.\n7. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
