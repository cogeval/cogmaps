Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who are donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Take the next scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   - If the scholar is not donating books, add all their connected scholars (who have not been visited before) to the queue.\n4. If no scholar donating books is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
