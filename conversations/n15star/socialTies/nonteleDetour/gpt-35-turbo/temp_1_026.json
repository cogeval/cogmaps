Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Reza is connected to Moin and Pari, but none of them are donating books. Puja is connected to Pam, who is not donating the maximum number of books. Pari is only connected to Moin, who is also not donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we check the connections of Reza, Moin, and Pari. Reza and Moin are connected to Pari, but again, none of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's move to Puja. Puja is connected to Pam, but Pam is not donating the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\nAnswer: Amir"
