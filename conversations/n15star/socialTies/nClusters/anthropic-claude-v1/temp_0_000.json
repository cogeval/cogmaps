The connections between scholars are:\nAmir - Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim - Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj - Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing - Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei - Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha - Ian, Sara, Max\nReza - Moin, Pari\nKim - Pam\nIan - Sara, Max\nMoin - Pari\nPuja - Pam\nSara - Max\n\n3. We need to find densely-connected clusters of at least 2 scholars. Based on the connections, we have:\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja \nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim \nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nCluster 5: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 6: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max  \nCluster 7: Reza, Moin, Pari\nCluster 8: Kim, Pam\nCluster 9: Ian, Sara, Max \nCluster 10: Moin, Pari\nCluster 11: Puja, Pam\nCluster 12: Sara, Max\n\nAnswer: there are 12 clusters"
