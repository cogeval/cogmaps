The first cluster includes Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, and Pam. This is because they are all connected to each other in some way. \n\n2. The second cluster includes Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. They are all connected to each other in some way. \n\n3. The third cluster includes Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. They are all connected to each other in some way. \n\nWe need to be careful with overlapping clusters. For example, Kim is in the first and second clusters, and Reza, Moin, and Pari are in the first and third clusters. \n\nAfter considering the overlaps, we can determine that there are actually only two unique densely-connected clusters: \n\n1. The first cluster includes Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n2. The second cluster includes Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
