Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Reza and Moin are connected to each other and Pari. Puja is also connected to Amir.\n\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam: Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei and Kim are connected to each other and Pam. Puja is also connected to Wim.\n\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim: Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Nisha and Ian are connected to each other and Sara. Kim is also connected to Raj.\n\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max: Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza and Moin are connected to each other and Pari. Max is also connected to Jing.\n\n5. Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam: Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim and Puja are connected to each other and Pam. \n\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max: Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian and Sara are connected to each other and Max.\n\nLooking at these clusters, we can see that some scholars appear in more than one cluster. Therefore, we need to combine these overlapping clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max: This cluster comes from combining clusters 1 and 4.\n\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam: This cluster remains the same as cluster 2.\n\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max: This cluster comes from combining clusters 3 and 6.\n\nAfter combining, we see that Max, Puja, and Kim appear in more than one cluster. Therefore, we need to combine these clusters into one:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max: This cluster comes from combining all the above clusters.\n\nSo, in the end, we have one densely-connected cluster. \n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
