Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this class? A densely-connected cluster is a group of students that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 students."

Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue are all connected to each other. (Cluster 1)\n2. Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. (Cluster 2)\n3. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil are all connected to each other. (Cluster 3)\n4. Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. (Cluster 4)\n5. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. (Part of Cluster 2)\n6. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. (Part of Cluster 3)\n7.

(Part of Cluster 3)\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that there are 4 main clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue\nCluster 2: Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice\nCluster 3: Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Soheil\nCluster 4: Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha\n\nHowever, each of these clusters has more than 2 students connected to each other, meaning none of them are densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 0 clusters"
