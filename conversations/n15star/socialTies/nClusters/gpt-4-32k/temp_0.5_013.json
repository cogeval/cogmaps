Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Jing is also connected to this cluster, but not to Amir or Puja, so Jing is not part of this cluster.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a cluster. They are all connected to each other.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim form a cluster. They are all connected to each other. Max is also connected to this cluster, but not to Raj or Kim, so Max is not part of this cluster.\n4. Reza, Moin, and Pari form a cluster. They are all connected to each other.\n5. Kim and Pam form a cluster. They are connected to each other.\n6. Ian, Sara, and Max form a cluster. They are all connected to each other.\n7. Moin and Pari form a cluster. They are connected to each other.\n8. Puja and Pam form a cluster. They are connected to each other.\n9. Sara and Max form a cluster. They are connected to each other.\n\nHowever, some of these clusters overlap. For example, the cluster of Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja overlaps with the cluster of Reza, Moin, and Pari. Similarly, the cluster of Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam overlaps with the cluster of Kim and Pam. The same is true for the other clusters. \n\nAfter removing the overlaps, we have the following distinct densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
