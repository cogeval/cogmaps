Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

So, Merge them.\n- Cluster 2, 5 are similar. So, Merge them.\n- Cluster 3, 6 are similar. So, Merge them.\n\nStep 3: Count the final number of clusters which are:\n- Cluster 1 & 4: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, and Max.\n- Cluster 2 & 5: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Cluster 3 & 6: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
