Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam.\n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n10. Moin is connected to Pari.\n11. Puja is connected to Pam.\n12. Sara is connected to Max.\n\nFrom these connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, and Jing form a cluster.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a cluster.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, and Max form a cluster.\n\nThere are three clusters where scholars are densely connected to each other.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
