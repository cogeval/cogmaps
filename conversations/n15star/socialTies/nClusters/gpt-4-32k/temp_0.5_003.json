Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This forms one cluster.\n\nWim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei and Kim are also connected to each other, so this forms another cluster.\n\nRaj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.

Reza, Moin, and Pari are also part of Amir's cluster, while Max is part of Raj's cluster. So, Jing does not form a new cluster.\n\nWei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. These connections are already part of Wim's cluster, so Wei does not form a new cluster.\n\nNisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. These connections are already part of Raj's cluster, so Nisha does not form a new cluster.\n\nReza is connected to Moin, and Pari. These connections are already part of Amir's cluster, so Reza does not form a new cluster.\n\nKim is connected to Pam.
