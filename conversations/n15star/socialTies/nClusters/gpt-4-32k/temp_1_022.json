Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

These are connected to each other with each having connections to at least two others.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form another densely-connected cluster. These are connected to each other with each having connections to at least two others.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim form the third densely-connected cluster. These are connected to each other with each having connections to at least two others.\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max form the fourth densely-connected cluster. These are connected to each other with each having connections to at least two others.\n\nIt's noticeable that some scholars are present in more than one cluster because of their connections, but it still contributes to forming a separate densely-connected cluster.\n\nSo, the number of densely-connected clusters in the group is 4.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
