Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Moin - Pari\n11. Puja - Pam\n12. Sara - Max\n\nNow let's check which groups have a minimum of 2 scholars and are densely connected:\n\n1. Amir - Reza - Moin - Pari: Densely connected.\n2. Amir - Puja: Not densely connected, as it has only two scholars.\n3. Wim - Wei - Kim - Puja - Pam: Densely connected.\n4. Raj - Nisha - Ian - Sara - Kim: Densely connected.\n5. Jing - Reza - Moin - Pari - Max: Densely connected.\n6. Nisha - Ian - Sara - Max: Densely connected.\n7. Reza - Moin - Pari: Densely connected.\n8.
