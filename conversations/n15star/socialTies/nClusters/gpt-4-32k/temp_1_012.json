Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir, Reza, Moin, and Pari are all connected to each other. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari. Puja is connected to Amir and Wim. \n\n2. The second cluster is 'Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam'. Wim, Wei, Kim, and Puja are all connected to each other. Pam is connected to Wim, Wei, Puja and Kim.\n\n3. The third cluster is 'Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim'. Raj, Nisha, Ian, and Sara are all connected to each other. Kim is connected to Raj and Wim.\n\n4. The fourth cluster is 'Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max'. Jing, Reza, Moin, and Pari are all connected to each other. Max is connected to Jing, Nisha, Ian, and Sara.\n\n5. The fifth cluster is 'Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max'. Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max are all connected to each other. \n\nAfter further analysis, we see that cluster 1 and cluster 4 are the same and cluster 3 and cluster 5 are the same, so we only have 3 unique clusters in total.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
