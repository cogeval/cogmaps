Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can do this by checking each scholar's connections and seeing if they match with other scholars' connections. \n\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Jing is also connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari, so there is a cluster there. \n\n3. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is also connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam, so there is another cluster. \n\n4. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Nisha is also connected to Ian, Sara, and Max, but not Kim, so there is a cluster with Raj, Nisha, Ian, and Sara, and another one with Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\n5. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari, which matches with Amir and Jing's connections, so they are already counted in the first cluster.\n\n6. Kim is connected to Pam, which matches with Wim and Wei's connections, so they are already counted in the second cluster.\n\n7. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max, which matches with Nisha's connections, so they are already counted in the third and fourth cluster.\n\n8. Moin is connected to Pari, which matches with Amir, Jing, and Reza's connections, so they are already counted in the first cluster.\n\n9. Puja is connected to Pam, which matches with Wim and Wei's connections, so they are already counted in the second cluster.\n\n10. Sara is connected to Max, which matches with Nisha and Ian's connections, so they are already counted in the third and fourth cluster.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that there are four densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
