Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

The connections suggest the following groupings:\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha, Ian, Sara, Max\nReza, Moin, Pari\nKim, Pam\nIan, Sara, Max\nMoin, Pari\nPuja, Pam\nSara, Max\n\nStep 2: Confirm that the clusters are densely connected. Each of the groups contains scholars who are connected to the others, so they are dense.\n\nStep 3: Remove any redundant clusters. Observing the groups, we can see that there are repeated clusters. After removing those, we get: \nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n\nStep 4: Count the number of remaining clusters. This leads to a total of 4.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
