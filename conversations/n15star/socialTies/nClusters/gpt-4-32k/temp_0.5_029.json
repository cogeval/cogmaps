Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This forms the first cluster.\n\nStep 3: Move to the next scholar, Wim, who is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Puja is already in the first cluster, but the others are not, so this forms a second cluster.\n\nStep 4: Continue with the next scholar, Raj, who is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Kim is already in the second cluster, but the others are not, so this forms a third cluster.\n\nStep 5: Next, consider Jing, who is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza, Moin, and Pari are already in the first cluster, but Max is not. Max is also connected to Nisha, Ian, and Sara, who are in the third cluster, so Max becomes a link between the first and third clusters, merging them into one.\n\nStep 6: The rest of the scholars (Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam, Sara, and Max) are already part of existing clusters and do not form new ones.\n\nStep 7: In the end, we have two densely-connected clusters: one that includes Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max, and another that includes Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
