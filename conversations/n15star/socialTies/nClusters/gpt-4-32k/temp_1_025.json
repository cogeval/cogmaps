Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each connection mentioned forms a potential cluster.\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha, Ian, Sara, Max\nReza, Moin, Pari\nKim, Pam\nIan, Sara, Max\nMoin, Pari\nPuja, Pam\nSara, Max\n\nStep 2: Combine overlapping clusters into larger clusters. This step requires going through each identified potential cluster and combining them if they share any members.\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\nJing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nPuja, Pam\nSara, Max\n\nStep 3: Identify densely-connected clusters. A densely-connected cluster is one where each member is connected to every other member. This requires examining the connections within each potential cluster.\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\n\nEach of these clusters is densely connected as per the given definition because each member is connected to at least 2 other members.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
