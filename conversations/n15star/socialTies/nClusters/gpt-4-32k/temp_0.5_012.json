Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Puja is connected to both Amir and Wim, but Wim is not connected to Amir, Reza, Moin, or Pari, so Puja is not part of the first cluster. \n\nStep 3: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a second cluster.\n\nStep 4: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim form a third cluster. However, Kim is also part of the second cluster. In densely-connected clusters, members should only belong to one group, so Kim's connections need to be evaluated. Kim is connected to Wei, Puja, and Pam (from the second cluster) and to Raj, Nisha, and Sara (from the third cluster). Therefore, Kim belongs to both the second and third clusters, which merge into one large cluster.\n\nStep 5: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max form another cluster. However, Reza, Moin, and Pari are also part of the first cluster. Therefore, the first and fourth clusters merge into one large cluster.\n\nStep 6: After merging, we have two densely-connected clusters: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing, Max} and {Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara}.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
