Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This group is densely connected as they all connect to each other.\n\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. This group is densely connected as they all connect to each other.\n\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. This group is densely connected as they all connect to each other.\n\nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. This group is densely connected as they all connect to each other.\n\nWei, Kim, Puja, and Pam all appear to be connected to the clusters they belong to and also to each other, which suggest they form a larger cluster.\n\nStep 2: Check for overlaps between the clusters to determine the total number of unique clusters.\n\nThe overlap between clusters 1 and 4 suggest they form a single cluster. The overlap between clusters 2 and 3, and the connections between Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam, suggest they form a single cluster as well. \n\nTherefore, the total number of unique clusters is 2.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
