Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

The first cluster is Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to any other member of this cluster, so she is not part of it.\n\n2. The second cluster is Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Kim is connected to Pam. Puja is also connected to Pam. \n\n3. The third cluster is Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian is connected to Sara and Max. Sara is connected to Max. Kim is not connected to any other member of this cluster, so she is not part of it.\n\n4. The fourth cluster is Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is connected to Pari. Max is only connected to Jing, Sara, and Ian, but they are not part of this cluster, so he is not part of it.\n\nSo, in total, there are 4 densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
