Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max, so Jing and Max are also part of this cluster.\n\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nWim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is also connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam, so they form another cluster.\n\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\nRaj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max, so they form another cluster.\n\nStep 3: Check if there are any overlaps between clusters. If a scholar is part of two clusters, those clusters should be merged.\n\nUpon checking, we can see that Puja, Kim, and Max are part of two clusters. Therefore, we merge these clusters.\n\nAfter merging, we have:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara\n\nStep 4: Count the number of clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 1 clusters."
