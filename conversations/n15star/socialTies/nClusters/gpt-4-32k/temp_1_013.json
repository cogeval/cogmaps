Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Wim's cluster could be: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n3. Raj's cluster could be: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\n4. Jing's cluster could be: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n5. Wei's cluster could be: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n6. Nisha's cluster could be: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max.\n7. Reza's cluster could be: Reza, Moin, Pari.\n8. Kim's cluster could be: Kim, Pam.\n9. Ian's cluster could be: Ian, Sara, Max.\n10. Moin's cluster could be: Moin, Pari.\n11. Puja's cluster could be: Puja, Pam.\n12. Sara's cluster could be: Sara, Max.\n\nAfter identifying the potential clusters, let's see which ones overlap and can therefore be combined:\n\n1. Amir's, Jing's, and Reza's clusters overlap significantly, as well as Moin's, forming one cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max.\n2. Wim's and Wei's clusters overlap and form a second cluster: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n3. Raj's and Nisha's clusters overlap, as do Ian's and Sara's, forming a third cluster: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max.\n4. Kim's and Puja's clusters can be included in the second cluster.\n\nAfter removing duplicates and clusters that have been included in other clusters, there are 3 separate clusters: Amir's cluster, Wim's cluster, and Raj's cluster.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
