Similarly, Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a group. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim form another group. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max form another group. Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a group. Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max form another group. Reza, Moin, and Pari form a group. Kim and Pam form a group. Ian, Sara, and Max form a group. Moin and Pari form a group. Puja and Pam form a group. Sara and Max form a group.\n\nStep 2: Combine overlapping groups.\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, and Max form a group. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam form a group. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim form a group.\n\nStep 3: Remove duplicates and groups with less than 2 scholars.\nWe have three groups: Group 1 consists of Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, and Max. Group 2 consists of Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam. Group 3 consists of Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
