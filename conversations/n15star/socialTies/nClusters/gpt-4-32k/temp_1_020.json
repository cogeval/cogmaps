Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We start with the first scholar and identify their connections, and then move on to the next scholar and do the same. Let's get started:\n\n1. Amir's cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. They are all connected with each other.\n\n2. Wim's cluster: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. However, Puja is already included in Amir's cluster, and Wei, Kim, and Pam are not directly connected to each other. So, we will not consider Wim's cluster as a densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Raj's cluster: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Ian, Sara and Kim are connected to each other, but Raj and Nisha are not connected with this group. \n\n4. Jing's cluster: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. However, all these members except Max are already included in Amir's cluster. Max is only connected with Nisha, Sara, and Jing, who are not connected with each other. So, we will not consider Jing's cluster as a densely-connected cluster.\n\n5. Nisha's cluster: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max. They are all connected with each other.\n\n6. Wei, Reza, Kim, Moin, Puja, Sara and Pam each have connections, but those do not form any new densely-connected cluster.\n\nIn conclusion, we have two densely-connected clusters: Amir's cluster and Nisha's cluster.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
