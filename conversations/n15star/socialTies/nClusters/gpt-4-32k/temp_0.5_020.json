Reza is connected to Amir, Moin, Pari, Jing. Moin is connected to Amir, Reza, Jing. Pari is connected to Amir, Reza, Jing. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari. This cluster is densely connected.\n\nCluster 2: Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja. Wei is connected to Wim, Kim, Puja, Pam. Kim is connected to Wim, Wei, Puja, Pam. Puja is connected to Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam. Pam is connected to Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja. This cluster is densely connected.\n\nCluster 3: Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara. Nisha is connected to Raj, Ian, Sara, Max. Ian is connected to Raj, Nisha, Sara, Max. Sara is connected to Raj, Nisha, Ian, Max. Max is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara.
