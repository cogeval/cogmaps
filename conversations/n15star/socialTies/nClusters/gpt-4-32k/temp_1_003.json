Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n3. Reza and Moin are connected to each other and to Pari. Pari is connected to both Amir and Jing, Reza, and Moin.\n- Cluster 1 is {Amir, Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari}\n\n3. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. \n4. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. \n5. Kim is connected to Pam. \n6. Puja is connected to Pam.\n- Cluster 2 is {Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam}\n\n7. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. \n8. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. \n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. \n10. Sara is connected to Max.\n- Cluster 3 is {Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max}\n\nScholars are appearing in multiple clusters like Kim, Puja, Max but they are clearly forming three separate groups where each scholar has connections to at least two other scholars within the group.\n\nTherefore, the answer to how many densely-connected clusters are in this group is:\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
