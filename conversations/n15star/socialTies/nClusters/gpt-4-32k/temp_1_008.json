Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Densely-connected clusters are groups with at least two scholars where each scholar is connected to every other scholar in the same group.\n\nLet's examine the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n4. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n5. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n6. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n7. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam.\n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max.\n10. Moin is connected to Pari.\n11. Puja is connected to Pam.\n12. Sara is connected to Max.\n\nFrom these connections, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nCluster 5: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 6: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\nCluster 7: Reza, Moin, Pari\nCluster 8: Kim, Pam\nCluster 9: Ian, Sara, Max\nCluster 10: Moin, Pari\nCluster 11: Puja, Pam\nCluster 12: Sara, Max\n\nHowever, many of these clusters have overlapping scholars. So, let's regroup the clusters based on unique individuals:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing, Max\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara\n\nBased on these calculations, we have 3 densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
