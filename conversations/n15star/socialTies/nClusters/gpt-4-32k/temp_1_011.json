Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Jing is also connected to Reza, Moin, and Pari, therefore Jing is part of this cluster too. \n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam are connected to each other forming a second cluster. \n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim are connected to each other forming a third cluster.\n\nHowever, upon a closer look, it appears that the clusters have overlapping members. Puja and Kim are part of both the first and second clusters, and Kim is also a member of the third cluster. Therefore, if we treat overlapping members as part of the same cluster, we actually only have one densely-connected cluster.\n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
