Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

The second cluster: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n3. The third cluster: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\n4. The fourth cluster: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n5. The fifth cluster: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n6. The sixth cluster: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max.\n7. The seventh cluster: Reza, Moin, Pari.\n8. The eighth cluster: Kim, Pam.\n9. The ninth cluster: Ian, Sara, Max.\n10. The tenth cluster: Moin, Pari.\n11. The eleventh cluster: Puja, Pam.\n12. The twelfth cluster: Sara, Max.\n\nWe see that some clusters are subsets of the bigger clusters and some scholars appear in multiple clusters. Therefore, some clusters are not unique or not densely-connected.\n\nNext, let's check the densely-connected clusters by eliminating the clusters which are the subsets of the bigger clusters.\n\n1. The first cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja. (This includes the 7th and 10th cluster)\n2. The second cluster: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam. (This includes the 5th and 8th cluster)\n3. The third cluster: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim. (This includes the 6th cluster)\n4. The fourth cluster: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n\nAfter the elimination, we have 4 unique densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
