Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This means that these clusters are interconnected and should be considered as one. Therefore, we have one densely-connected cluster.\n\nAnswer: there are 1 clusters."
