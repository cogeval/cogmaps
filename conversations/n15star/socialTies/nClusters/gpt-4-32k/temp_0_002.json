Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

After merging, we get:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\nCluster 2: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max\n\nStep 7: Again, we see that Kim and Max appear in both clusters, so we merge these two clusters into one. \n\nFinal Cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara\n\nStep 8: Count the number of final clusters. \n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
