Combine them into Cluster 1-4: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue, Noah, Anisha.\n- Clusters 2 and 5 have Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice in common. Combine them into Cluster 2-5: Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, Alice.\n- Clusters 3 and 6 have Abdul, Durga, and Ajit in common. Combine them into Cluster 3-6: Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit, Soheil, Anisha.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of final clusters:\n- Cluster 1-4\n- Cluster 2-5\n- Cluster 3-6\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
