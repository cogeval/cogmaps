Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n2. Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n3. Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\n4. Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n5. Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam.\n6. Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max.\n7. Reza: Moin, Pari.\n8. Kim: Pam.\n9. Ian: Sara, Max.\n10. Moin: Pari.\n11. Puja: Pam.\n12. Sara: Max.\n\nAnalyzing this information, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari.\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\nCluster 5: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max.\n\nHowever, clusters 1, 4, and 2, 5 have overlapping members and form one cluster each. Hence, they are considered as a single cluster respectively.\n\nAfter revising, we have:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Jing, Max.\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 2 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
