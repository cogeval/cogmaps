Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

For finding densely-connected clusters, we'll look for groups of scholars where each scholar has a connection with every other scholar in the group. \n\nStep 1: List all scholars and their connections:\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam.\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max.\nReza: Moin, Pari.\nKim: Pam.\nIan: Sara, Max.\nMoin: Pari.\nPuja: Pam.\nSara: Max.\n\nStep 2: Identify Densely-connected clusters:\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari.\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\nCluster 5: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max.\n\nStep 3: Verify each cluster. All of the scholars in a cluster should be connected to each other. For example, all scholars in cluster 1 (Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari) should be connected to each other. For all 5 identified clusters, these conditions are met.\n\nFinally, you count the unique clusters. Be aware that some clusters may be subsets of others, so only count the distinct ones.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 distinct clusters."
