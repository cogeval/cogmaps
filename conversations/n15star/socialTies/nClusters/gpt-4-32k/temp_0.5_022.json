Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja are connected to each other.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam are connected to each other.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim are connected to each other.\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max are connected to each other.\n5. Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam are connected to each other.\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max are connected to each other.\n7. Reza, Moin, and Pari are connected to each other.\n8. Kim and Pam are connected to each other.\n9. Ian, Sara, and Max are connected to each other.\n10. Moin and Pari are connected to each other.\n11. Puja and Pam are connected to each other.\n12. Sara and Max are connected to each other.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that there are overlaps in the groups. We can combine these overlaps to form larger groups. After combining, we have the following clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, Max, Wim, Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n2. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, and Max.\n\nTherefore, we have 2 densely-connected clusters. \n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
