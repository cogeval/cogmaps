Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja: This group is densely connected as each scholar is connected to at least two others.\n\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam: This is another densely connected group. Puja is also part of the first cluster, suggesting overlap.\n\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim: This group is densely connected, but Kim is also part of the second cluster, indicating further overlap.\n\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max: This group is densely connected. Reza, Moin, and Pari are also part of the first cluster, indicating overlap. Max is also connected to Nisha, Ian, and Sara from the third cluster.\n\n5. Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam: This cluster is already included in the second group.\n\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max: This cluster is already included in the third group.\n\n7. Reza, Moin, Pari: This cluster is already included in the first group.\n\n8. Kim, Pam: This cluster is already included in the second group.\n\n9. Ian, Sara, Max: This cluster is already included in the third group.\n\n10. Moin, Pari: This cluster is already included in the first group.\n\n11. Puja, Pam: This cluster is already included in the second group.\n\n12. Sara, Max: This cluster is already included in the third group.\n\nAfter considering all the connections and overlaps, we can see that there are three unique densely-connected clusters: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja; Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam; Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max, Jing.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
