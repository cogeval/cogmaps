Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

For example, Kim is part of both Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, and Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max are part of both Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. This means that these clusters are actually connected and should be considered as one cluster. \n\nSo, after combining the connected clusters, we have:\n\nFinal Cluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max, Jing\n\nAnswer: there are 1 clusters."
