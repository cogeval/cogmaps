Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n7. Reza, Moin, Pari\n8. Kim, Pam\n9. Ian, Sara, Max\n10. Moin, Pari\n11. Puja, Pam\n12. Sara, Max\n\nNow, we have several repetitions, let's filter out these repetitions:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n5. Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\nWe also need to consider the connections within these filtered clusters. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja are all connected as are Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Jing is connected to the same group as Amir, just with the addition of Max, so that's another densely-connected cluster. Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam are all connected. \n\nThis gives us 4 distinct densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
