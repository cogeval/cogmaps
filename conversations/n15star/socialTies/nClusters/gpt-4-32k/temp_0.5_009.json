Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a densely-connected cluster. They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim form a densely-connected cluster. They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max form a densely-connected cluster. They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n5. Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam form a densely-connected cluster. They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n6. Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max form a densely-connected cluster. They all have connections to at least two other members in the group.\n\nHowever, many of these clusters overlap. For example, the cluster of Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja overlaps with the cluster of Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Similarly, the cluster of Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam overlaps with the cluster of Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. \n\nWhen we remove these overlaps, we are left with three unique densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Jing, and Max.\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
