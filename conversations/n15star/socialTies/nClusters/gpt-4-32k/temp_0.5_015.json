Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

For a group to be densely-connected, each scholar in the group should be connected to at least one other scholar in the same group. \n\nFrom the information given, all three groups meet the criteria of being densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
