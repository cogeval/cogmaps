Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This forms the first cluster.\n\nStep 3: Move to the next scholar, Wim, who is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Puja is already in the first cluster, but Wei, Kim, and Pam are not. This forms the second cluster.\n\nStep 4: Continue with Raj, who is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Kim is already in the second cluster, but Nisha, Ian, and Sara are not. This forms the third cluster.\n\nStep 5: Proceed with Jing, who is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza, Moin, and Pari are already in the first cluster, but Max is not. Max is also connected to Nisha, Ian, and Sara from the third cluster. Therefore, Max, Nisha, Ian, and Sara form a new cluster, which is the fourth cluster.\n\nStep 6: Wei, who is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam, is already in the second cluster.\n\nStep 7: Nisha, who is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max, is already in the fourth cluster.\n\nStep 8: Reza, who is connected to Moin, and Pari, is already in the first cluster.\n\nStep 9: Kim, who is connected to Pam, is already in the second cluster.\n\nStep 10: Ian, who is connected to Sara, and Max, is already in the fourth cluster.\n\nStep 11: Moin, who is connected to Pari, is already in the first cluster.\n\nStep 12: Puja, who is connected to Pam, is already in the second cluster.\n\nStep 13: Sara, who is connected to Max, is already in the fourth cluster.\n\nStep 14: All scholars have been grouped into clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
