Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. This forms one cluster.\n2. Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Puja is also connected to Amir's cluster. Since there are more connections with this cluster, we will consider this part of Amir's cluster. \n3. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Kim is connected to Wim's cluster, which we have already integrated into Amir's cluster. Thus, this forms part of the same cluster.\n4. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza, Moin, and Pari are in Amir's cluster. Thus, Jing's connections are also part of the same cluster.\n5. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. All are part of Amir's cluster. \n6. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian, Sara, and Max are in Raj's cluster which we have integrated into Amir's cluster. \n7. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari, who are both in Amir's cluster.\n8. Kim is connected to Pam, who is in Wim's cluster which we integrated into Amir's cluster.\n9. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max, who are both part of Raj's cluster, which we integrated into Amir's cluster.\n10. Moin is connected to Pari, who is in Amir's cluster.\n11. Puja is connected to Pam, who is in Wim's cluster which we integrated into Amir's cluster.\n12. Sara is connected to Max, both are part of Raj's cluster, which we integrated into Amir's cluster. \n\nAll the scholars are connected, and there is only one densely-connected cluster in the group.\n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
