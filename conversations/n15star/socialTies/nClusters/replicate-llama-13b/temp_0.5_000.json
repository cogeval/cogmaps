Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

I will approach this problem by analyzing the given connections and identifying dense clusters.\nStep 1: Identify connected components\nThe given connections can be represented as a graph, where the scholars are the nodes, and the connections between them are the edges. To identify the connected components, we can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). Let's use DFS to start with.\nStep 2: Find dense clusters\nNow that we have identified the connected components, we need to find the dense clusters within each component. A dense cluster is defined as a group of scholars who are connected to each other with at least 2 scholars. We can start by identifying the number of scholars in each component and looking for clusters that have at least 2 scholars.\nStep 3: Count the dense clusters\nAfter identifying the dense clusters, we need to count the number of dense clusters in each component. We can do this by iterating through each cluster and counting the number of scholars who are connected to each other.\nStep 4: Find the total number of dense clusters\nFinally, we need to find the total number of dense clusters across all components. We can do this by summing up the number of dense clusters in each component.\nAnswer: There are [0-9]+ clusters.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Step 1: Identified connected components using DFS.
