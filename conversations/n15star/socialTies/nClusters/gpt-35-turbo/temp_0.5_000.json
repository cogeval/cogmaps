Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's represent the connections in a graph:\n\n- Amir -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n- Wim -> Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Raj -> Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n- Jing -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n- Wei -> Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Nisha -> Ian, Sara, Max\n- Reza -> Moin, Pari\n- Kim -> Pam\n- Ian -> Sara, Max\n- Moin -> Pari\n- Puja -> Pam\n- Sara -> Max\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected clusters using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:\n\n- Start with Amir: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja\n- Start with Wim: Wim -> Wei -> Kim -> Pam\n- Start with Raj: Raj -> Nisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Max\n- Start with Jing: Jing -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Max\n\nFrom the above steps, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
