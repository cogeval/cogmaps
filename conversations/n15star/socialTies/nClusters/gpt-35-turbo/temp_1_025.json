Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Start with an empty list to store the clusters.\n3. Iterate through each scholar in the list of scholars.\n4. For each scholar, check if they have at least one connection with another scholar.\n5. If they do, create a new cluster and add both scholars to it.\n6. Check if any of the connections of the first scholar are also connected to each other.\n7. If they are, add them to the cluster as well.\n8. Continue this process until no more connections can be added to the cluster.\n9. Add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n10. Repeat this process for any remaining unprocessed scholars.\n11. Count the number of clusters in the list.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
