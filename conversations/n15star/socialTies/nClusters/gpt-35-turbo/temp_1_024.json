Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges in the graph.\n\nWe can start by identifying all the clusters of scholars that are densely connected.\n\n1. Create a list of all the scholars: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Jing, Max].\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the clusters.\n3. Iterate through each scholar in the list.\n   a. For each scholar, create a set to store their densely connected cluster.\n   b. Use a recursive function to find all the scholars in the densely connected cluster.\n      - Start with the current scholar and add them to the cluster set.\n      - For each connection of the current scholar, if the connected scholar is not already in the cluster set, recursively call the function to add the connected scholar and their connections to the cluster set.\n4. After iterating through all the scholars, add the cluster set to the list of clusters if it contains more than 1 scholar.\n5. Count the number of clusters in the list.\n6. Return the count of densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
