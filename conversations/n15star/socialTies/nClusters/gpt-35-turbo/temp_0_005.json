Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency list to represent the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max\nReza: Moin, Pari\nKim: Pam\nIan: Sara, Max\nMoin: Pari\nPuja: Pam\nSara: Max\n\nNow, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the connected components. We start with an empty list of clusters and an empty set of visited nodes.\n\nFor each scholar, if the scholar has not been visited, we start a new cluster and perform a DFS or BFS to find all the scholars connected to that scholar. We add all the visited scholars to the cluster and mark them as visited.\n\nAfter iterating through all the scholars, the number of clusters will be the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nLet's perform the DFS to find the clusters:\n\n1. Start with an empty list of clusters and an empty set of visited nodes.\n2. Iterate through each scholar:\n   a. If the scholar has not been visited:\n      i. Start a new cluster.\n      ii. Perform a DFS or BFS to find all the scholars connected to that scholar.\n      iii. Add all the visited scholars to the cluster and mark them as visited.\n      iv. Add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n3. The number of clusters is the length of the list of clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
