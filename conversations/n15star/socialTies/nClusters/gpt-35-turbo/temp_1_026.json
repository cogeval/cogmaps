Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar will represent a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars will represent edges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to find the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars using adjacency lists or matrices.\n\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n3. Iterate through each scholar in the group.\n\n4. If the scholar has not been visited yet, start a depth-first search (DFS) from that scholar to explore the connected component.\n\n5. During the DFS, mark each visited scholar as visited and add them to the current connected component.\n\n6. After the DFS finishes, add the current connected component to the set of visited nodes.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for any remaining unvisited scholars.\n\n8. The number of densely-connected clusters in the group will be equal to the size of the set of visited nodes.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
