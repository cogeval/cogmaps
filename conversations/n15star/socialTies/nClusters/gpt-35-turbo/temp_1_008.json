Create a graph representation of the connections.\n3. Find all the densely-connected clusters in the graph.\n4. Count the number of clusters found.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Scholars and their connections:\n\n   - Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n   - Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n   - Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n   - Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max\n   - Reza: Moin, Pari\n   - Kim: Pam\n   - Ian: Sara, Max\n   - Moin: Pari\n   - Puja: Pam\n   - Sara: Max\n\n2. Graph representation:\n\n   - Amir -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n   - Wim -> Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Raj -> Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n   - Jing -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n   - Wei -> Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Nisha -> Ian, Sara, Max\n   - Reza -> Moin, Pari\n   - Kim -> Pam\n   - Ian -> Sara, Max\n   - Moin -> Pari\n   - Puja -> Pam\n   - Sara -> Max\n\n3. Densely-connected clusters:\n\n   - Cluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n   - Cluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n   - Cluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\n4. Counting the clusters: Answer: there are 3 clusters"
