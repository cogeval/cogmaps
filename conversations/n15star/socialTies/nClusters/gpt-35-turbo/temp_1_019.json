Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Starting with Amir, we have the following connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. From Reza, we have connections with Moin and Pari. Since this cluster has at least 2 scholars, we count it as one cluster.\n3. Moving on to Moin, we see a connection with Pari. Again, this cluster has at least 2 scholars, so we count it as a separate cluster.\n4. Pari is connected to herself, forming another cluster of at least 2 scholars.\n5. Puja is connected to Pam and Kim. Although this cluster has 3 scholars, it does not meet the minimum requirement of 2 connections to be considered a densely-connected cluster.\n\nIn total, we have 3 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
