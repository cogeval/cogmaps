Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node, and the connections between scholars represent edges in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's represent the connections in a more organized way:\n\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max\nReza: Moin, Pari\nKim: Pam\nIan: Sara, Max\nMoin: Pari\nPuja: Pam\nSara: Max\n\nNow, we can start identifying the densely-connected clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on the graph.\n\nStarting with Amir, we can perform a DFS to identify the cluster connected to him:\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja\n\nNext, we move on to Wim, who is not connected to any scholar that hasn't already been visited.\n\nMoving on to Raj, we can perform another DFS:\n\nRaj -> Nisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Max\n\nNow, we move on to Jing:\n\nJing -> Max\n\nFinally, we move on to Wei:\n\nWei -> Kim -> Pam\n\nBased on the DFS, we have identified 5 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
