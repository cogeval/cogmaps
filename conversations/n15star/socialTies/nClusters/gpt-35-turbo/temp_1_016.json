We can start with the first scholar, Amir, and follow the connections to identify all the scholars in his cluster.\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\nNext, we move to the next scholar, Wim, and identify the scholars in his cluster.\n\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n\nNow, we move to the next scholar, Raj, and identify the scholars in his cluster.\n\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n\nMoving on to the next scholar, Jing, and identify the scholars in his cluster.\n\nCluster 4: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n\nFinally, we check the remaining scholars who are not part of any previous cluster.\n\nCluster 5: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
