Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Create a list of scholars and their connections based on the given information:\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n\n2. Analyze the connections to identify densely-connected clusters:\n   - We start with Amir and his connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Among them, Reza, Moin, and Pari are also connected to each other. This forms the first densely-connected cluster.\n   - Next, we move to Wim and his connections: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Among them, Kim, Puja, and Pam are also connected to each other. This forms the second densely-connected cluster.\n   - Then, we consider Raj and his connections: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Among them, Kim, Ian, and Sara are connected to each other. This forms the third densely-connected cluster.\n   - After that, we look at Jing and his connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Among them, Reza, Moin, and Pari are connected to each other. This forms the fourth densely-connected cluster.\n   - Finally, we consider Nisha and her connections: Ian, Sara, and Max. Among them, Ian and Sara are connected to each other. This forms the fifth densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Count the total number of densely-connected clusters: We have identified five densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
