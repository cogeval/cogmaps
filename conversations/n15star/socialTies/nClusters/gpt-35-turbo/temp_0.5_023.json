Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can represent each scholar as a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars as edges between the nodes. \n\nFirst, let's create a list of all the scholars and their connections:\n\n- Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n- Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n- Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n- Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max\n- Reza: Moin, Pari\n- Kim: Pam\n- Ian: Sara, Max\n- Moin: Pari\n- Puja: Pam\n- Sara: Max\n\nNext, let's create a graph using this information:\n\n- Nodes: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam, Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Jing, Max\n- Edges: (Amir, Reza), (Amir, Moin), (Amir, Pari), (Amir, Puja), (Wim, Wei), (Wim, Kim), (Wim, Puja), (Wim, Pam), (Raj, Nisha), (Raj, Ian), (Raj, Sara), (Raj, Kim), (Jing, Reza), (Jing, Moin), (Jing, Pari), (Jing, Max), (Wei, Kim), (Wei, Puja), (Wei, Pam), (Nisha, Ian), (Nisha, Sara), (Nisha, Max), (Reza, Moin), (Reza, Pari), (Kim, Pam), (Ian, Sara), (Ian, Max), (Moin, Pari), (Puja, Pam), (Sara, Max)\n\nNow, we can find the densely-connected clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. We start with each node as a starting point for the DFS and count the number of nodes visited. If the number of visited nodes is greater than or equal to 2, it forms a densely-connected cluster.\n\nLet's perform the DFS starting from each node and count the number of densely-connected clusters:\n\nStarting from Amir:\n- Visited nodes: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n- Number of visited nodes: 5 (Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja)\n\nStarting from Wim:\n- Visited nodes: Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n- Number of visited nodes: 5 (Wim, Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam)\n\nStarting from Raj:\n- Visited nodes: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 5 (Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max)\n\nStarting from Jing:\n- Visited nodes: Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 5 (Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max)\n\nStarting from Wei:\n- Visited nodes: Wei, Kim, Pam\n- Number of visited nodes: 3 (Wei, Kim, Pam)\n\nStarting from Nisha:\n- Visited nodes: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 4 (Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max)\n\nStarting from Reza:\n- Visited nodes: Reza, Moin, Pari\n- Number of visited nodes: 3 (Reza, Moin, Pari)\n\nStarting from Kim:\n- Visited nodes: Kim, Pam\n- Number of visited nodes: 2 (Kim, Pam)\n\nStarting from Ian:\n- Visited nodes: Ian, Sara, Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 3 (Ian, Sara, Max)\n\nStarting from Moin:\n- Visited nodes: Moin, Pari\n- Number of visited nodes: 2 (Moin, Pari)\n\nStarting from Puja:\n- Visited nodes: Puja, Pam\n- Number of visited nodes: 2 (Puja, Pam)\n\nStarting from Sara:\n- Visited nodes: Sara, Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 2 (Sara, Max)\n\nStarting from Pam:\n- Visited nodes: Pam\n- Number of visited nodes: 1 (Pam)\n\nStarting from Max:\n- Visited nodes: Max\n- Number of visited nodes: 1 (Max)\n\nFrom the above DFS results, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
