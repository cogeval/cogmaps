Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can represent each scholar as a node and their connections as edges between the nodes.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can create the following graph:\n\nAmir - Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim - Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj - Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing - Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei - Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha - Ian, Sara, Max\nReza - Moin, Pari\nKim - Pam\nIan - Sara, Max\nMoin - Pari\nPuja - Pam\nSara - Max\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected clusters. Starting from each scholar, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the scholars connected to them. If the number of connected scholars is greater than or equal to 2, we have a densely-connected cluster.\n\nStarting from each scholar, we can perform the following DFS:\n\nDFS starting from Amir: Amir - Reza - Moin - Pari - Puja (4 scholars)\nDFS starting from Wim: Wim - Wei - Kim - Puja - Pam (5 scholars)\nDFS starting from Raj: Raj - Nisha - Ian - Sara - Max (5 scholars)\nDFS starting from Jing: Jing - Reza - Moin - Pari - Max (4 scholars)\n\nFrom the above DFS, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
