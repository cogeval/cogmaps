Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between scholars will be represented as edges.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can construct the following graph:\n\nAmir - Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim - Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj - Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing - Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei - Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha - Ian, Sara, Max\nReza - Moin, Pari\nKim - Pam\nIan - Sara, Max\nMoin - Pari\nPuja - Pam\nSara - Max\n\nNow, we can identify the densely-connected clusters by finding the connected components in the graph. A connected component is a subgraph where every pair of nodes is connected by a path.\n\nUsing a graph algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), we can traverse the graph and identify the connected components.\n\nStarting with the first scholar, Amir, we can perform a DFS to find all the scholars connected to Amir. This will give us the first densely-connected cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nNext, we move to the next unvisited scholar, Wim, and perform a DFS to find all the scholars connected to Wim. This will give us the second densely-connected cluster: Wim, Wei, Kim, and Pam.\n\nMoving on to the next unvisited scholar, Raj, we perform a DFS to find all the scholars connected to Raj. This will give us the third densely-connected cluster: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Max.\n\nFinally, we move to the last unvisited scholar, Jing, and perform a DFS to find all the scholars connected to Jing. This will give us the fourth densely-connected cluster: Jing.\n\nSince we have visited all the scholars and found all the densely-connected clusters, the final outcome is:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
