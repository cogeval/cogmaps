Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n3. Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n4. Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n5. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n6.

Puja is connected to Pam.\n12. Sara is connected to Max.\n\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\nCluster 4: Jing\n\nAnswer: There are 4 clusters."
