Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's list down all the connections:\n\nAmir - Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim - Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj - Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing - Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei - Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha - Ian, Sara, Max\nReza - Moin, Pari\nKim - Pam\nIan - Sara, Max\nMoin - Pari\nPuja - Pam\nSara - Max\n\nNow we can start identifying the densely-connected clusters. We will use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and identify the clusters.\n\nStarting with Amir, we can see that Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. Moin is only connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam, and Pam is only connected to Kim. None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nMoving on to Wim, we can see that Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Wei is connected to Kim and Puja. Kim is only connected to Pam. Puja is connected to Pam. None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nNext is Raj, who is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian is connected to Sara and Max. Sara is only connected to Max. None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nJing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Reza and Moin are already part of the clusters we identified earlier. Pari is only connected to Moin. Max is not connected to any other scholar. None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nFinally, we have Nisha, who is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Ian and Sara are already part of the clusters we identified earlier. Max is not connected to any other scholar. None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that there are 0 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 0 clusters"
