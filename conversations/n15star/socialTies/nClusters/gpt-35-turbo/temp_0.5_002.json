Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We will iterate through each scholar and perform a depth-first search to identify all the scholars connected to them. If the number of connected scholars is greater than or equal to 2, we will count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store the connections for each scholar.\n2. Iterate through each scholar and initialize an empty set to store the visited scholars.\n3. For each unvisited scholar, perform a depth-first search to find all the connected scholars.\n4. If the number of connected scholars is greater than or equal to 2, increment the cluster count.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all scholars have been visited.\n\nNow, let's implement this algorithm and find the number of densely-connected clusters:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
