Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We will start by identifying the clusters based on their connections.\n\n1. Starting with Amir, we find that he is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n\n   This forms the first cluster: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, and Pam.\n\n2. Moving on to Wim, we find that he is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim and Puja.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Puja is already included in the first cluster.\n   - Pam is already included in the first cluster.\n\n   This does not form a new cluster as the scholars are already part of the first cluster.\n\n3. Continuing with Raj, we find that he is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Sara is already included in the first cluster.\n   - Kim is already included in the first cluster.\n\n   This does not form a new cluster as the scholars are already part of the first cluster.\n\n4. Moving to Jing, we find that he is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Reza, Moin, and Pari are already included in the first cluster.\n   - Max is connected to Nisha and Sara.\n\n   This forms a second cluster: Jing, Max, Nisha, and Sara.\n\nSo, based on the given connections, there are 2 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
