Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars.\n2. Initialize a counter variable for the number of densely-connected clusters.\n3. For each scholar in the group:\n   a. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that scholar.\n   b. Keep track of visited scholars to avoid revisiting them.\n   c. If the DFS reaches a scholar that has already been visited, increment the counter variable.\n4. The final value of the counter variable represents the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1.

Initialize counter: 0\n\n3. DFS starting from each scholar:\n   - DFS starting from Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim, Max (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Reza: Moin, Pari (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Kim: Pam (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Ian: Sara, Max (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Moin: Pari (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Puja: Pam (visited)\n   - DFS starting from Sara: Max (visited)\n\n4.
