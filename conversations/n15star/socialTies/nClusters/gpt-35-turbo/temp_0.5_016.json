Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph representation of the connections:\n\nAmir -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim -> Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj -> Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing -> Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei -> Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha -> Ian, Sara, Max\nReza -> Moin, Pari\nKim -> Pam\nIan -> Sara, Max\nMoin -> Pari\nPuja -> Pam\nSara -> Max\n\nNow, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as depth-first search (DFS), to identify the connected components. We start with an empty list of clusters and a set of unvisited nodes.\n\n1. Initialize an empty list of clusters.\n2. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes with all the scholars.\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\n   a. Choose an unvisited node and start a new cluster.\n   b. Perform a DFS from the chosen node to find all connected nodes.\n   c. Add the connected nodes to the current cluster and remove them from the unvisited set.\n   d. Repeat steps a-c until there are no more connected nodes.\n   e. Add the current cluster to the list of clusters.\n4. The number of densely-connected clusters is the length of the list of clusters.\n\nNow, let's perform the DFS algorithm to find the densely-connected clusters:\n\nDFS from Amir:\nAmir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja\nDFS from Wim:\nWim -> Wei -> Kim -> Pam\nDFS from Raj:\nRaj -> Nisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Max\nDFS from Jing:\nJing -> Max\nDFS from Nisha:\nNisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Max\nDFS from Reza:\nReza -> Moin -> Pari\nDFS from Kim:\nKim -> Pam\nDFS from Ian:\nIan -> Sara -> Max\nDFS from Moin:\nMoin -> Pari\nDFS from Puja:\nPuja -> Pam\nDFS from Sara:\nSara -> Max\n\nThe densely-connected clusters are:\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
