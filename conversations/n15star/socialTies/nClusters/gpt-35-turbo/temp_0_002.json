Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency list to represent the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max\nReza: Moin, Pari\nKim: Pam\nIan: Sara, Max\nMoin: Pari\nPuja: Pam\nSara: Max\n\nNext, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the connected components. We start with an empty set of clusters and iterate through each scholar. If the scholar has not been visited before, we perform a DFS or BFS to find all the scholars connected to that scholar. We add these scholars to a cluster and mark them as visited. We repeat this process for all unvisited scholars until we have found all the clusters.\n\nLet's perform a DFS to find the clusters:\n\n1. Start with an empty set of clusters.\n2. Iterate through each scholar:\n   a. If the scholar has not been visited before:\n      i. Create a new cluster.\n      ii. Perform a DFS to find all the scholars connected to that scholar.\n      iii. Add these scholars to the cluster and mark them as visited.\n      iv. Add the cluster to the set of clusters.\n3. The number of clusters is the size of the set of clusters.\n\nPerforming the DFS:\n\n1. Start with an empty set of clusters.\n2. Start with the scholar Amir.\n   a. Create a new cluster.\n   b. Add Amir to the cluster.\n   c. Mark Amir as visited.\n   d. Perform a DFS from Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n      i. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja to the cluster.\n      ii. Mark Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja as visited.\n   e. Add the cluster to the set of clusters.\n3. Start with the scholar Wim.\n   a. Wim has already been visited, so skip.\n4. Start with the scholar Raj.\n   a. Raj has already been visited, so skip.\n5. Start with the scholar Jing.\n   a. Jing has already been visited, so skip.\n6. Start with the scholar Wei.\n   a. Wei has already been visited, so skip.\n7. Start with the scholar Nisha.\n   a. Nisha has already been visited, so skip.\n8. Start with the scholar Reza.\n   a. Reza has already been visited, so skip.\n9. Start with the scholar Kim.\n   a. Kim has already been visited, so skip.\n10. Start with the scholar Ian.\n    a. Ian has already been visited, so skip.\n11. Start with the scholar Moin.\n    a. Moin has already been visited, so skip.\n12. Start with the scholar Puja.\n    a. Puja has already been visited, so skip.\n13. Start with the scholar Sara.\n    a. Sara has already been visited, so skip.\n14. The set of clusters is {Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}.\n15. The number of clusters is 1.\n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
