Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this class? A densely-connected cluster is a group of students that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 students."

We can represent each student as a node in the graph and draw edges between two nodes if they are connected to each other. Then, we can identify densely-connected clusters by finding groups of nodes that are all connected to each other with a max of 2 edges. \n\nUsing this approach, we can see that there are 5 densely-connected clusters in this class:\n\n1. Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Gongxue\n2. Paul, Solomon, Soheil, Alice\n3. Pierre, Abdul, Durga, Ajit\n4. Noah, Anisha\n5. Gongxue, Alice\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
