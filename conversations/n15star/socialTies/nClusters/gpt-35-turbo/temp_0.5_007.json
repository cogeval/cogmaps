Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can start with Amir and check who he is connected to: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Among these connections, we see that Reza, Moin, and Pari are all connected to each other, forming a densely-connected cluster. \n\nNext, let's move on to Wim and see who he is connected to: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. Among these connections, we see that Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam are all connected to each other, forming another densely-connected cluster. \n\nMoving on to Raj, we see that Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim are all connected to each other, forming another densely-connected cluster. \n\nLastly, Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Among these connections, we see that Reza, Moin, and Pari are all connected to each other, forming yet another densely-connected cluster. \n\nIn summary, we have identified 4 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
