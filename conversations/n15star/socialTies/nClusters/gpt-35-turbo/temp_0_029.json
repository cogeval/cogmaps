Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nWe can start by creating an adjacency list representation of the graph:\n\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max\nReza: Moin, Pari\nKim: Pam\nIan: Sara, Max\nMoin: Pari\nPuja: Pam\nSara: Max\n\nNext, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each scholar to identify the connected components. We will mark each visited scholar to avoid revisiting them.\n\nStarting from Amir, we can perform a DFS and visit Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. These scholars form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nNext, we move to Wim, but all the scholars connected to Wim (Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam) are already visited, so we don't form a new cluster.\n\nWe continue this process for each scholar, marking visited scholars and forming clusters. The clusters we find are:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nCluster 2: Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\nCluster 3: Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\nCluster 4: Jing\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
