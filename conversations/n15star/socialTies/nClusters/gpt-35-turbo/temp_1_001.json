We can use a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the connections.\n\nStarting with each scholar, we will check if their connections form a densely-connected cluster. If so, we mark all the scholars in the cluster as visited and move on to the next unvisited scholar. \n\nWe repeat this process until we have visited all the scholars. The number of clusters formed will be our final outcome.\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first unvisited scholar (Amir):\n   - Amir's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster, so we move on to the next unvisited scholar.\n\n2. Next unvisited scholar (Wim):\n   - Wim's connections are Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Next unvisited scholar (Raj):\n   - Raj's connections are Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n4. Next unvisited scholar (Jing):\n   - Jing's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n   - Jing, Reza, Moin, and Pari form a densely-connected cluster.\n   - Mark Jing, Reza, Moin, and Pari as visited.\n\n5. Next unvisited scholar (Wei):\n   - Wei's connections are Kim, Puja, Pam.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n6. Next unvisited scholar (Nisha):\n   - Nisha's connections are Ian, Sara, Max.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n7. Next unvisited scholar (Reza):\n   - Reza's connections are Moin, Pari.\n   - Reza and Moin form a densely-connected cluster.\n   - Mark Reza and Moin as visited.\n\n8. Next unvisited scholar (Kim):\n   - Kim's connections are Pam.\n   - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n9. Next unvisited scholar (Ian):\n   - Ian's connections are Sara, Max.\n   - Ian, Sara, and Max form a densely-connected cluster.\n   - Mark Ian, Sara, and Max as visited.\n\n10. Next unvisited scholar (Moin):\n    - Moin's connections are Pari.\n    - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n11. Next unvisited scholar (Puja):\n    - Puja's connections are Pam.\n    - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n12. Next unvisited scholar (Sara):\n    - Sara's connections are Max.\n    - None of these connections form a densely-connected cluster.\n\n13. All scholars have been visited. The final outcome is:\n    - Densely-connected clusters: 2\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
