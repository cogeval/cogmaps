Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Among these scholars, Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja are all connected to each other. \n\nMoving on to Wim, he is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. In this case, only Puja is connected to both Wei and Kim. \n\nNext is Raj, who is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. Among these scholars, Kim is connected to Sara, while Nisha is connected to Ian. \n\nJing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Among these scholars, Reza, Moin, and Pari are connected to each other. \n\nContinuing with Wei, who is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Again, only Puja is connected to both Kim and Pam. \n\nNisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Among these scholars, Ian and Sara are connected to each other. \n\nFinally, Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. There are no other connections involving Reza in this group. \n\nBased on this analysis, we have the following densely-connected clusters:\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Puja, Wei, Kim, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara\n4. Jing, Reza, Moin, Pari\n5. Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
