Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n4. Jing\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nA densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars.\n\nIn this case, we have 2 densely-connected clusters: \n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
