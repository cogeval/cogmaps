Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nWe can start by creating an adjacency list representation of the graph:\n\nAmir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei: Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha: Ian, Sara, Max\nReza: Moin, Pari\nKim: Pam\nIan: Sara, Max\nMoin: Pari\nPuja: Pam\nSara: Max\n\nNext, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each scholar to identify the connected components. We will mark each visited scholar to avoid revisiting them.\n\nStarting from Amir, we can perform a DFS and visit Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. These scholars form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nNext, we move to Wim, but all the scholars connected to Wim (Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam) are already visited, so we skip this step.\n\nMoving to Raj, we perform a DFS and visit Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim. These scholars form another densely-connected cluster.\n\nNext, we move to Jing, but all the scholars connected to Jing (Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max) are already visited, so we skip this step.\n\nMoving to Wei, we perform a DFS and visit Kim, Puja, and Pam. These scholars form another densely-connected cluster.\n\nFinally, we move to Nisha, but all the scholars connected to Nisha (Ian, Sara, and Max) are already visited, so we skip this step.\n\nIn total, we have found 3 densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
