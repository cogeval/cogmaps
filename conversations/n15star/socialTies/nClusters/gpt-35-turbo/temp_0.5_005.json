Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nHere are the steps to find the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Create a graph with 15 nodes representing the scholars.\n2. Add edges between the connected scholars based on the given connections.\n3. Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the connected components in the graph.\n4. Count the number of connected components that have a minimum of 2 scholars.\n5. Output the total number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nLet's go through the steps one by one:\n\n1. Create a graph with 15 nodes representing the scholars:\n   - Amir\n   - Reza\n   - Moin\n   - Pari\n   - Puja\n   - Wim\n   - Wei\n   - Kim\n   - Pam\n   - Raj\n   - Nisha\n   - Ian\n   - Sara\n   - Jing\n   - Max\n\n2. Add edges between the connected scholars based on the given connections:\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n\n3. Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the connected components in the graph:\n   - Start with the first scholar (Amir) and perform a DFS to find all connected scholars.\n   - Repeat the DFS for the remaining scholars that have not been visited.\n\n4. Count the number of connected components that have a minimum of 2 scholars:\n   - If a connected component has 2 or more scholars, count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\n5. Output the total number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
