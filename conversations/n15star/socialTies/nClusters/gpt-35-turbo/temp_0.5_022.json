Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can represent each scholar as a node in the graph, and their connections as edges between nodes.\n\nStep 1: Create a graph representation of the connections:\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n- Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n- Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n- Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n- Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n- Kim is connected to Pam.\n- Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n- Moin is connected to Pari.\n- Puja is connected to Pam.\n- Sara is connected to Max.\n\nThe graph representation would look like this:\nAmir - Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\nWim - Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\nRaj - Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\nJing - Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\nWei - Kim, Puja, Pam\nNisha - Ian, Sara, Max\nReza - Moin, Pari\nKim - Pam\nIan - Sara, Max\nMoin - Pari\nPuja - Pam\nSara - Max\n\nStep 2: Identify the connected components:\n- We can start with any scholar and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all connected scholars.\n- Keep track of visited scholars to avoid revisiting them.\n- Repeat the DFS process until all scholars have been visited.\n\nBased on the connections, the connected components are as follows:\n1. Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n2. Wim, Wei, Kim, Pam\n3. Raj, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max\n4. Jing\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected clusters:\n- A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars with a minimum of 2 scholars.\n- Count the number of connected components with two or more scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
