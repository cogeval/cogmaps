Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent the edges.\n\nHere are the steps to find the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the clusters.\n3. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. For each unvisited node in the graph, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all connected nodes.\n5. Add the connected nodes to a cluster and mark them as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all nodes have been visited.\n7. Add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n8. Count the number of clusters.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections:\n   - Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n   - Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, Kim\n   - Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n   - Wei: Kim, Puja, Pam\n   - Nisha: Ian, Sara, Max\n   - Reza: Moin, Pari\n   - Kim: Pam\n   - Ian: Sara, Max\n   - Moin: Pari\n   - Puja: Pam\n   - Sara: Max\n\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the clusters: clusters = []\n\n3. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes: visited = set()\n\n4. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) for each unvisited node:\n   - Start with Amir:\n     - Add Amir to the visited set.\n     - Create a new cluster and add Amir to it.\n     - Perform DFS on each connected node of Amir (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja).\n     - Add the connected nodes to the cluster and mark them as visited.\n   - Repeat the process for each unvisited node (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara).\n\n5. After performing DFS for all nodes, add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n\n6. Count the number of clusters: cluster_count = len(clusters)\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
