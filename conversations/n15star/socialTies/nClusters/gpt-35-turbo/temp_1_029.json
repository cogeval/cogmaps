Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We will first create a graph representing the connections between the scholars, and then identify the clusters with at least two scholars. \n\nLet's go through the connections and build the graph:\n\n- Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n- Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n- Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n- Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n- Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n- Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n- Kim is connected to Pam.\n- Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n- Moin is connected to Pari.\n- Puja is connected to Pam.\n- Sara is connected to Max.\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Starting from each scholar, we will perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all connected scholars within a cluster.\n2. During the DFS, we will keep track of the visited scholars to avoid visiting them again.\n3. If the size of the cluster is at least 2, we will count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nBased on these steps, let's begin the DFS:\n\n- Start from scholar Amir: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim -> Sara -> Ian -> Nisha -> Max.\n- The cluster size is 11, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Wim: Wim -> Wei.\n- The cluster size is 2, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Raj: Raj -> Nisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Kim -> Pam.\n- The cluster size is 6, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Jing: Jing -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari -> Max.\n- The cluster size is 5, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Wei: Wei -> Kim -> Pam.\n- The cluster size is 3, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Nisha: Nisha -> Ian -> Sara -> Max.\n- The cluster size is 4, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Reza: Reza -> Moin -> Pari.\n- The cluster size is 3, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Kim: Kim -> Pam.\n- The cluster size is 2, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Ian: Ian -> Sara -> Max.\n- The cluster size is 3, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Moin: Moin -> Pari.\n- The cluster size is 2, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Puja: Puja -> Pam.\n- The cluster size is 2, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\n- Start from scholar Sara: Sara -> Max.\n- The cluster size is 2, so it is a densely-connected cluster.\n\nBased on the above analysis, there are 12 densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 12 clusters."
