First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between scholars:\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Wim is connected to Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Raj is connected to Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n   - Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n   - Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n   - Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max.\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Kim is connected to Pam.\n   - Ian is connected to Sara and Max.\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Puja is connected to Pam.\n   - Sara is connected to Max.\n\n2. Now, let's identify the connected components in this graph. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and identify the clusters:\n   - Start with an empty list of clusters.\n   - For each scholar in the group:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited yet:\n       - Create a new cluster.\n       - Perform a DFS starting from the current scholar, adding all connected scholars to the cluster.\n       - Add the cluster to the list of clusters.\n\n3. After performing the DFS algorithm on all scholars, we will have a list of clusters. To determine the number of densely-connected clusters, we need to count the clusters that have a minimum of 2 scholars.\n\n4.
