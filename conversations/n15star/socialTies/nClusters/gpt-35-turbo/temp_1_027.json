Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. How many densely-connected clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We'll iterate through each scholar and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to identify all the scholars connected to them. If a connected component has at least 2 scholars, we count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a list of visited scholars as an empty set and a counter for densely-connected clusters as 0.\n2. Iterate through each scholar in the group.\n3. If the scholar is not visited, perform a DFS starting from that scholar:\n   - Create an empty stack and push the current scholar onto it.\n   - While the stack is not empty:\n     - Pop a scholar from the stack.\n     - If the scholar is not visited, mark them as visited and add them to the connected component.\n     - Push all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar onto the stack.\n4. If the size of the connected component is greater than or equal to 2, increment the counter for densely-connected clusters.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all scholars in the group are visited.\n6. The final counter value is the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nNow let's go through the process and find the number of densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
