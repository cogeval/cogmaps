This means you should recognize the keywords and be able to identify what is expected from you. Then, the final step is to give the answer following the regular expression.\n\nTo do so, you will have to iterate through the graph. As the final output should be a number, you can either use a mathematical function (e.g., sum) or use a data type with numeric values.\n\nHere is a sample of a possible answer, where we have identified the keyword \"clusters\" and provided a numeric answer.\n\nWe also have another exercise on Python, but it is not related to regular expressions. If you want to try it out, please send us a message and we will send it to you.\n\nIf you are interested in this kind of challenges, please contact us and we will send you more exercises.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in regular expressions, please check out our website. We have several online tools that can help you learn and practice regular expressions. For example, our online RegEx Tester tool is a free and easy-to-use regular expression tester. We also have a Regular Expression Che"
