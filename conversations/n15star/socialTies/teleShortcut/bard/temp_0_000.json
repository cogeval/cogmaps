Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, that is Kim, who is donating 50 books.\n2. Find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. This can be done using a graph search algorithm, such as breadth-first search or depth-first search. In this case, the shortest path is Amir \u2192 Kim.\n3. List the scholars in order, starting with Amir. In this case, the list is Amir, Kim.\n\nI hope this helps!
