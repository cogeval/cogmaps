Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   3.1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   3.2. Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, store the scholar's name and the number of books donated.\n   3.3. Check if the scholar has any connections that are not yet visited. If yes, enqueue those connections and mark them as visited.\n4. The final outcome will be the scholar names in order, starting from Amir and including the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given information, we can determine the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Queue: [Amir], Visited: [Amir]\n2. Dequeue Amir\n3. Amir has connections: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n4. Enqueue [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja] and mark them as visited\n5. Queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja], Visited: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n6. Dequeue Reza\n7. Reza has connections: [Moin, Pari]\n8. Enqueue [Moin, Pari] and mark them as visited\n9.
