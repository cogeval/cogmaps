Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Here are the steps to determine the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is donating books. If yes, record the number of books donated by that scholar.\n3. If Amir is not directly connected to any scholar who is donating books, traverse the connections of Amir's connections.\n4. Repeat step 2 for each connection until a scholar who is donating books is found.\n5. Keep track of the shortest path by storing the names of scholars encountered in the process.\n6. Stop the search when a scholar who is donating the maximum number of books is found.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
