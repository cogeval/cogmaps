Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the shortest path to reach each scholar and initialize it with Amir as the starting point.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar and initialize it with 0 for all scholars.\n5. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books donated and initialize it to 0.\n6.
