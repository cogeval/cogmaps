Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to the previous scholar.\n4. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books donated and initialize it to 0.\n5. Create a variable to store the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and initialize it to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum:\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar who is donating them.\n   - Check if the scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books:\n     - If yes, break the loop.\n   - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   - Update the path dictionary to store the path from the connected scholar to the current scholar.\n7. If the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books is found:\n   - Create a list to store the shortest path from Amir to the scholar.\n   - Starting from the scholar, follow the path dictionary to trace back the path to Amir.\n   - Append each scholar to the list.\n8. Reverse the list to get the shortest path from Amir to the scholar.\n9. Concatenate the scholars' names in the list, separated by commas, and add Amir's name at the beginning.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
