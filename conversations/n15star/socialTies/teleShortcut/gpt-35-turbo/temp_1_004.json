We'll start by creating a graph representation of the connections between scholars.\n\nFirst, let's represent the connections between scholars using a dictionary in Python. Each scholar will be a key, and their connected scholars will be the values in a list.\n\nconnections = {\n    'Amir': ['Reza', 'Moin', 'Pari', 'Puja'],\n    'Reza': ['Moin', 'Pari'],\n    'Moin': ['Pari'],\n    'Pari': [],\n    'Puja': ['Pam'],\n    'Wim': ['Wei', 'Kim', 'Puja', 'Pam'],\n    'Wei': ['Kim', 'Puja', 'Pam'],\n    'Kim': ['Pam'],\n    'Raj': ['Nisha', 'Ian', 'Sara', 'Kim'],\n    'Nisha': ['Ian', 'Sara', 'Max'],\n    'Ian': ['Sara', 'Max'],\n    'Sara': ['Max'],\n    'Jing': ['Reza', 'Moin', 'Pari', 'Max'],\n    'Max': [],\n    'Pam': []\n}\n\nNow, let's perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max).\n\nWe'll use a queue to keep track of the scholars to visit. We'll start by adding Amir to the queue. We'll also create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we've already visited.\n\nqueue = ['Amir']\nvisited = set(['Amir'])\n\nWe'll also create a parent dictionary to keep track of the parent of each scholar in the shortest path. We'll initialize it with Amir as the parent of all scholars.\n\nparent = {'Amir': None}\n\nNow, we'll perform the BFS. We'll continue until the queue is empty or we find Max.\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_scholar = queue.pop(0)\n    if current_scholar == 'Max':\n        break\n    for connected_scholar in connections[current_scholar]:\n        if connected_scholar not in visited:\n            queue.append(connected_scholar)\n            visited.add(connected_scholar)\n            parent[connected_scholar] = current_scholar\n\nAfter the BFS, we can reconstruct the shortest path from Amir to Max using the parent dictionary.\n\npath = ['Max']\ncurrent_scholar = 'Max'\nwhile parent[current_scholar] is not None:\n    current_scholar = parent[current_scholar]\n    path.insert(0, current_scholar)\n\nFinally, let's list the scholars in order, starting from Amir, separated by commas:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
