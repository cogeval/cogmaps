Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Check the next person in the queue.\n6. If the next person is the one who is donating the maximum number of books (Kim), stop and return the path.\n7.
