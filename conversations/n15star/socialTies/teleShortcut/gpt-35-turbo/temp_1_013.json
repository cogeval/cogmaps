Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Let's start from Amir and explore their connections to other scholars.\n\nAmir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Among these connections, Pari is not connected to any other scholars who are donating books. Puja is connected to Wei, Kim, and Pam. Kim is donating the most books, so we should prioritize reaching Kim.\n\nNow, let's explore Puja's connections. Puja is connected to Wei, Kim, and Pam. Kim is the one who is donating the most books, so we will prioritize reaching Kim. \n\nKim is connected to Pam. Since Pam is not donating any books, we can ignore this connection.\n\nNext, let's explore Wei's connections. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Since Kim is already donating the most books, we can ignore this connection.\n\nBased on the above exploration, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

Let's update the connections and prioritize reaching the person with the most book donations.\n\nStarting from Amir, let's explore their direct connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. Since Pari is not connected to any other scholars donating books, we can ignore this connection.\n\nNow, let's explore Puja's connections. Puja is connected to Wei, Kim, and Pam. Kim is the one who is donating the most books, so we will prioritize reaching Kim.\n\nHowever, we have the option to use Eva's connection portal to reach anyone connected to Pam. Let's consider this option and explore Pam's connections. Pam is connected to Kim.\n\nBased on the above exploration, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
