Create an empty path dictionary to store the path from each scholar to their previous scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Check if the current scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Proceed to step 6.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through all the scholars connected to the current scholar that have not been visited. Add them to the queue and mark them as visited. Update the path dictionary to store the path from the current scholar to these scholars.\n6.
