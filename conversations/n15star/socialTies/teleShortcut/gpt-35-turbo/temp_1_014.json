Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir.\n2. Expand Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check if any of Amir's connections have a higher number of book donations than the current maximum (which is 10). None of them do.\n4. Expand the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, excluding Amir and any scholar that has already been visited.\n5. Reza's connections: Moin and Pari. Moin has not been visited, so add Moin to the queue.\n6. Moin's connections: Pari. Pari has not been visited, so add Pari to the queue.\n7. Pari's connections: None.\n8. Puja's connections: Pam. Pam has not been visited, so add Pam to the queue.\n9. Check if any of the scholars in the queue have a higher number of book donations than the current maximum. None of them do.\n10. Continue expanding the connections of Moin, Pari, and Pam until a scholar with a higher number of book donations is found.\n11. Moin's connections: Pari. Pari has already been visited, so skip Pari.\n12. Pam's connections: None.\n13.

Since there are no more unvisited connections from the initial group, we can now use Eva's instant connection portal.\n15. Since Pam is connected to Puja, we can go from Eva to Puja.\n16. From Puja, we can expand the connections to Pam.\n17. Pam's connections: None.\n18. Since there are no more unvisited connections from Puja, we have reached the end.\n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books, considering Eva's instant connection portal, is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja"
