Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. Start a loop until the queue is empty.\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, remember the maximum number of books and the path taken to reach this scholar.\n   c. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the dequeued scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   d. Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n\n3. After the loop ends, the path with the maximum number of books will be available.
