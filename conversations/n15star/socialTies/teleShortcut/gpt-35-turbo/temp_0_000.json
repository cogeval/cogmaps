Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. You are connected with Vivian and a new app appears in which you can connect to anyone only once. From Vivian, what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

From Salma, we can connect to either Shanshan or Vadim, who are connected to each other and to Salma. \n\nIf we connect to Shanshan, we can then connect to either Noah or Anisha, who are both connected to Salma. However, neither Noah nor Anisha are connected to any other students, so this path would only yield a total of 5 connections.\n\nIf we connect to Vadim instead, we can then connect to either Noah or Anisha, who are both connected to Salma and to Vadim. This path would yield a total of 6 connections.\n\nTherefore, the connection path that yields the most reward is: Vivian, Salma, Vadim, Anisha, Noah.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Vadim, Anisha, Noah."
