Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path to each person. Set the shortest path to Amir as an empty list.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each person is donating. Set the number of books donated by Amir as 0.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the person who is donating them.\n   - For each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar is not visited:\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n       - Update the shortest path to the connected scholar by appending the current scholar to the shortest path to the current scholar.\n       - Update the number of books donated by the connected scholar by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n5.
