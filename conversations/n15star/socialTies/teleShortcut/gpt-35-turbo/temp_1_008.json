Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if this scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books (Max). If so, we have found the shortest path.\n   c. If not, add all the scholars connected to this scholar (but not already visited) to the queue and visited set.\n4. If we finish the while loop without finding Max, it means there is no path from Amir to Max.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm step by step:\n\n1.
