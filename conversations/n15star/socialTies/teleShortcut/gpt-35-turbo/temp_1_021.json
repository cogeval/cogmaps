Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Then, for each person in the queue, we will check if they are donating books. If they are, we will update the maximum number of books and store their name. Finally, we will continue the BFS until we have visited all connected scholars.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to the queue.\n2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books and set it to 0.\n3. Initialize a variable to store the name of the person donating the maximum number of books.\n4. Start the BFS loop:\n    a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n    b. Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, update the maximum number of books and store the scholar's name.\n    c. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar (if not already visited).\n    d. Repeat steps a-c until the queue is empty.\n5. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given information.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
