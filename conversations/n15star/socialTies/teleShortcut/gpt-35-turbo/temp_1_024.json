We will continue this search until we reach the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue for the breadth-first search algorithm.\n\n2. Add Amir to the queue as the starting point.\n\n3. Pop the first scholar from the queue, which is Amir.\n\n4. Check if Amir is connected to any other scholars. If yes, add those scholars to the queue with the path and number of books donated updated accordingly. For example, if Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, we will add them to the queue with the path as \"Amir -> Scholar\" and the number of books donated as 0 (since Amir is not donating any books).\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books or the queue becomes empty.\n\n6. If we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books, return the path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue: Queue = []\n\n2. Add Amir to the queue: Queue = [Amir]\n\n3. Pop the first scholar from the queue: Queue = []\n\n4. Check connections of Amir:\n\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue with the path as \"Amir -> Scholar\" and the number of books donated as 0.\n\n   Queue = [Reza -> Amir, Moin -> Amir, Pari -> Amir, Puja -> Amir]\n\n5. Pop the next scholar from the queue: Queue = [Moin -> Amir, Pari -> Amir, Puja -> Amir]\n\n6. Check connections of Moin:\n\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Add Pari to the queue with the path as \"Moin -> Pari\" and the number of books donated as 0.\n\n   Queue = [Pari -> Moin, Pari -> Amir, Puja -> Amir]\n\n7. Pop the next scholar from the queue: Queue = [Pari -> Amir, Puja -> Amir]\n\n8. Check connections of Pari:\n\n   - Pari is connected to Reza.\n   - Add Reza to the queue with the path as \"Pari -> Reza\" and the number of books donated as 0.\n\n   Queue = [Pari -> Reza, Puja -> Amir]\n\n9. Pop the next scholar from the queue: Queue = [Puja -> Amir]\n\n10. Check connections of Puja:\n\n    - Puja is connected to Kim and Pam.\n    - Add Kim and Pam to the queue with the path as \"Puja -> Scholar\" and the number of books donated as 0.\n\n    Queue = [Pam -> Puja, Kim -> Puja]\n\n11. Pop the next scholar from the queue: Queue = [Pam -> Puja, Kim -> Puja]\n\n12. Check connections of Pam and Kim:\n\n    - Pam and Kim are not connected to anyone.\n\n13. The queue is empty, which means we have searched through all possible paths.\n\n14. The person donating the maximum number of books is Max (10 books). The shortest path from Amir to Max is:\n\n    Answer: Amir, Moin, Pari, Reza, Max"
