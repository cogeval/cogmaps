Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar and update it as we traverse the connections.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Mark Amir as visited.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated, starting with 0.\n5. Initialize a variable to store the name of the person donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the current scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n      - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the name of the person.\n   c. Iterate through the connections of the current scholar:\n      - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n        - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n        - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n7.
