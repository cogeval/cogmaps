Introduction to Machine Learning\n\nIn this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:\n\n  * The motivation behind machine learning\n  * What is machine learning?\n  * The types of machine learning\n  * Supervised learning\n  * Unsupervised learning\n  * A short history of machine learning\n  * Deep learning\n  * The machine learning workflow\n\n# Motivation behind machine learning\n\nWe have been studying for years, trying to find a way to represent data using algorithms and programming languages. These languages were built on the basis of different rules that were applied to the data to provide a solution. When we solve a problem using these algorithms, we refer to them as a **program**. When we talk about machine learning, we actually talk about a new way to build a program that solves a problem.\n\nIn the field of computer science, machine learning is a subset of AI. We can say that machine learning is a field of computer science that helps us in making a machine intelligent."
