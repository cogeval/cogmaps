Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Since Amir is not directly connected to Kim, we need to find the connecting scholars:\n\n- Amir is directly connected to Puja.\n- Puja is directly connected to Wim.\n- Wim is directly connected to Kim.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim."
