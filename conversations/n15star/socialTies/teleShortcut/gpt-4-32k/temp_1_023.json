Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

He is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nAmong Amir's connections, neither Reza, Moin, nor Pari have any connection with Kim. However, Puja is connected to Kim. \n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be going through Puja.\n\nTherefore, the list of scholars in order of connection from Amir to Kim is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nThis means that Amir can access the most donated books by reaching out to Puja, who can reach out to Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim."

Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

She is connected to Wim, Wei, Puja, and Kim.\n\nKim is the person donating the maximum number of books. Since Eva can connect to any of Pam's connections, Eva can connect directly to Kim.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be through his wife Eva. \n\nHence, the list of scholars in order of connection from Amir to Kim is Amir, Eva, Kim. \n\nThis means that Amir can access the most donated books by reaching out to his wife Eva, who can reach out to Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Eva, Kim."
