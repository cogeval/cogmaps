We should choose the student who is connected to the most other students. In this case, it is Salma, who is connected to 3 other groups (Group 1, Group 4, and Group 7).\n\nStep 5: Continue the path.\nFrom Salma, we can connect to Shanshan, Vadim, or Anisha. We should choose the student who is connected to the most other students. In this case, it is Shanshan, who is connected to 2 other groups (Group 4 and Group 7).\n\nStep 6: Complete the path.\nFrom Shanshan, we can connect to Vadim or Anisha. We should choose the student who is connected to the most other students. In this case, it is Vadim, who is connected to 1 other group (Group 7).\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim"
