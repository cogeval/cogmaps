Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From this, we can see that Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\nStep 3: Check if Kim is one of the scholars Amir is directly connected to. In this case, Kim is not a direct connection.\nStep 4: Check the connections of Amir's connections (Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja) and find out if any of them are directly connected to Kim. From the information given, none of them are directly connected to Kim. \nStep 5: Since none of Amir's connections are directly connected to Kim, check if their connections (second degree connections of Amir) are connected to Kim. From the information, we can see that Puja is connected to Kim. \nStep 6: So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

From the provided information, we know Pam is connected to Wim, Wei, Puja, and Kim.\nStep 4: From this, it's clear that Kim (the person donating the most books) is one of Pam's connections.\nStep 5: Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is now through Eva and then Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Eva, Pam, Kim"
