We can also connect to Group 2 through Gongxue.\n\nStep 4: Choose the group with the most new connections.\nGroup 4 has 2 new connections (Noah and Anisha), while Group 2 has 4 new connections (Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice). So, we choose Group 2.\n\nStep 5: Find the next group to connect to.\nFrom Group 2, we can connect to Group 3 through Soheil, Group 5 through Solomon, Soheil, or Gongxue, or Group 8 through Soheil and Alice.\n\nStep 6: Choose the group with the most new connections.\nGroup 3 has 4 new connections (Pierre, Abdul, Durga, and Ajit), Group 5 has 0 new connections, and Group 8 has 0 new connections. So, we choose Group 3.\n\nStep 7: Find the next group to connect to.\nFrom Group 3, we can connect to Group 6 through Abdul, Durga, or Ajit, or Group 9 through Durga and Ajit.\n\nStep 8: Choose the group with the most new connections.\nGroup 6 has 1 new connection (Anisha), while Group 9 has 0 new connections. So, we choose Group 6.\n\nStep 9: Determine the final connection path.\nThe connection path is Vivian (Group 1) -> Gongxue (Group 2) -> Soheil (Group 3) -> Abdul (Group 6).\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil, Abdul"
