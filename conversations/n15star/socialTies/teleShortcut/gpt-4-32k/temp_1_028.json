Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Given that Kim is donating the most books (50), we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim. \n\nFirst, I will establish who Amir is connected to. According to the information given, Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nThe next step is to check if Kim is among Amir's immediate connections. Kim is not directly connected to Amir. Hence, we need to look for a path through the scholars Amir is connected to.\n\nBy examining the connections of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja, I notice that Puja is connected to Kim. \n\nThis means that the shortest path from Amir to Kim (the person donating the most books) is through Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"
