Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books.

Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books, so Kim is the person donating the most books.\n\nNow we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim, tracing through the connections given. \n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Among these, Puja is directly connected to Pam.\n3. Pam is directly connected to Kim.\n\nHence, the shortest path from Amir to Kim, who is donating the maximum number of books, is through Puja and Pam. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
