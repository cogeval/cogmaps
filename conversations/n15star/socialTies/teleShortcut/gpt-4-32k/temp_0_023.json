We can achieve this by connecting to the following students in order:\n\n1. Vivian (already connected)\n2. Salma (Group 1)\n3. Shanshan (Group 1)\n4. Vadim (Group 1)\n5. Gongxue (Group 1)\n6. Paul (Group 2)\n7. Solomon (Group 2)\n8. Soheil (Group 2)\n9. Alice (Group 2)\n10. Pierre (Group 3)\n11. Abdul (Group 3)\n12. Durga (Group 3)\n13. Ajit (Group 3)\n14. Noah (Group 4)\n15.
