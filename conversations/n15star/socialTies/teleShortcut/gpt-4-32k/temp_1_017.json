Max is donating 10 books.\n\nLooking at Amir's connections, none of them are directly connected to Kim who is donating the maximum number of books. However, let's explore the second layer of connections:\n\n1. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari.\n2. Moin is connected to Pari.\n3. Pari is not connected to anyone else.\n4. Puja is connected to Pam.\n\nStill, none of these connections lead to Kim. Now let's look at the third layer of connections:\n\n1. Pam is connected to Kim.\n\nFinally, we found a path from Amir to Kim. So, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be:\n\nAmir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
