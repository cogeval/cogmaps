Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Firstly, we should review all the connections of Amir. Amir is connected with Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. \n2. Now we need to check if any of these people are connected with Kim. It turns out that Puja is directly connected to Kim.\n3. So the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be through Puja.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum books is Amir, Puja, Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Kim"

This means that from Eva you can go to anyone connected with Pam. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The first step would be to review all of Pam's connections. Pam is connected with Wim, Wei, Puja, and Kim.\n2. Now we need to identify if Kim is in Pam's connections. It appears that Kim is directly connected to Pam.\n3. So the shortest path from Amir to Kim would be through Eva and then to Kim, due to Eva's connection portal to Pam's connections.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum books is Amir, Eva, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Eva, Kim"
