The code is returning 0 in this case.\nCrafter's Note: we can eliminate the two cases easily.\nHumans use words to communicate; we use sentences. And sentences contain lots of words. If you wanted to find all the words in your sentence containing 'not', you could search its words.\nI'm also curious as to why \"students\" should find a match in your input list.\nThose are my answers; they work for me.\nI suspect that is what 'matchWords' is doing; but how should 'matchWord' behave if there a sentence that the input words"
