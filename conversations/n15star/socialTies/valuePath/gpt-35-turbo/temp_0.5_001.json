Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and check if they are donating books.\n   c. If the scholar is donating books, record their name and the number of books they are donating.\n   d. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar, who have not been visited, into the queue.\n5. Find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books from the recorded names and numbers.\n6. Trace back the path from this scholar to Amir using the recorded connections.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Enqueue Amir: queue = [Amir]\n3. Visit Amir: visited = {Amir}\n4. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja: queue = [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n5. Visit Reza: visited = {Amir, Reza}\n6. Enqueue Moin and Pari: queue = [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n7. Visit Moin: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin}\n8. Enqueue Pari: queue = [Pari, Puja]\n9. Visit Pari: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari}\n10. Enqueue Puja: queue = [Puja]\n11. Visit Puja: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n12. Enqueue Pam: queue = [Pam]\n13. Visit Pam: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam}\n14. Enqueue Wei: queue = [Wei]\n15. Visit Wei: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei}\n16. Enqueue Kim: queue = [Kim]\n17. Visit Kim: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim}\n18. Enqueue Nisha, Ian, Sara: queue = [Nisha, Ian, Sara]\n19. Visit Nisha: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim, Nisha}\n20. Enqueue Ian, Sara: queue = [Ian, Sara]\n21. Visit Ian: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim, Nisha, Ian}\n22. Enqueue Sara: queue = [Sara]\n23. Visit Sara: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim, Nisha, Ian, Sara}\n24. Enqueue Max: queue = [Max]\n25. Visit Max: visited = {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja, Pam, Wei, Kim, Nisha, Ian, Sara, Max}\n\nNow, we have recorded the connections and the number of books donated by each scholar. We can see that Max is donating the maximum number of books (10).\n\nTo trace back the path from Max to Amir, we follow the recorded connections:\n\nMax -> Nisha -> Kim -> Wei -> Wim -> Amir\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Kim, Nisha, Max"
