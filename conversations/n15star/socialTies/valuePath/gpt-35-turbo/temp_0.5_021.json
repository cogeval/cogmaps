Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Check if Amir is connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Take the first person from the queue.\n   - Check if this person is donating books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this person.\n   - If not, add all the connections of this person to the queue.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no one is found who is donating books, return \"No path found\".\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them is donating books, so add their connections to the queue: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Take the first person from the queue: Reza.\n   - Reza is not donating books. Add his connections to the queue: Moin and Pari.\n4. Take the first person from the queue: Moin.\n   - Moin is not donating books. Add his connections to the queue: Pari.\n5. Take the first person from the queue: Pari.\n   - Pari is not donating books. No more connections to add.\n6. The queue is now empty. No one is found who is donating books. Return \"No path found\".\n\nAnswer: No path found"
