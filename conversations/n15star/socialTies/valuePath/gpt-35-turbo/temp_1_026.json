Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n   - Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n   - Queue: {Amir}\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-6.\n\n4. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Dequeued: Amir\n   - Queue: {}\n\n5. Check if the dequeued scholar is connected to any scholars who haven't been visited yet and enqueue them.\n   - Connected scholars: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\n6. Mark the connected scholars as visited and update the queue.\n   - Visited: {Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n   - Queue: {Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja}\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty.\n\nBy following the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"
