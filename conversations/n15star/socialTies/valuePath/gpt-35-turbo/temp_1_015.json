Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

If so, stop the search.\n- If the person is not donating the maximum number of books, enqueue their connections (excluding the ones already visited) to the queue.\n- Repeat until the queue is empty or the person donating the maximum number of books is found.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the queue with Amir and create an empty visited set.\nQueue: [Amir]\nVisited: []\n\nStep 2: Dequeue Amir from the queue.\nQueue: []\nVisited: [Amir]\n\nStep 3: Check Amir's connections and enqueue them if they have not been visited yet.\nEnqueued: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\nQueue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\nVisited: [Amir]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue Reza from the queue.\nQueue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza]\n\nStep 5: Check Reza's connections and enqueue them if they have not been visited yet.\nEnqueued: [Moin, Pari]\nQueue: [Moin, Pari, Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza]\n\nStep 6: Dequeue Moin from the queue.\nQueue: [Pari, Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin]\n\nStep 7: Check Moin's connections and enqueue them if they have not been visited yet.\nEnqueued: [Pari]\nQueue: [Pari, Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin]\n\nStep 8: Dequeue Pari from the queue.\nQueue: [Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari]\n\nStep 9: Check Pari's connections and enqueue them if they have not been visited yet.\nEnqueued: []\nQueue: [Puja]\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari]\n\nStep 10: Dequeue Puja from the queue.\nQueue: []\nVisited: [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza"
