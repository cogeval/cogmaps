Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first person from the queue.\n   b. Check if this person is donating books. If yes, this is the person who is donating the maximum number of books. Stop the search.\n   c. If not, check if this person is connected to someone who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. If the search ends without finding a person who is donating books, then there is no path from Amir to anyone who is donating books.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nStep 2: Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating books, so we add them to the queue.\nQueue: Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\nStep 3a: Dequeue Reza.\nStep 3b: Reza is not donating books.\nStep 3c: Reza is connected to Moin and Pari. None of them are donating books, so we skip this step.\n\nStep 3a: Dequeue Moin.\nStep 3b: Moin is not donating books.\nStep 3c: Moin is connected to Pari. Pari is not donating books, so we skip this step.\n\nStep 3a: Dequeue Pari.\nStep 3b: Pari is not donating books.\nStep 3c: Pari is connected to Puja. Puja is not donating books, so we skip this step.\n\nStep 3a: Dequeue Puja.\nStep 3b: Puja is not donating books.\nStep 3c: Puja is not connected to anyone who is donating books.\n\nSince the queue is empty and we haven't found a person who is donating books, there is no path from Amir to anyone who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to anyone who is donating the maximum number of books."
