Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books donated by each person. \n\nStarting with Amir, the queue will be as follows:\nQueue: Amir (0 books)\n\nFirst, we visit Amir and check his connections:\nAmir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nQueue: Reza (0 books), Moin (0 books), Pari (0 books), Puja (0 books)\n\nNext, we visit Reza and check his connections:\nReza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n\nQueue: Moin (0 books), Pari (0 books), Puja (0 books), Moin (0 books), Pari (0 books)\n\nNow, we visit Moin and check his connections:\nMoin is connected to Pari.\n\nQueue: Pari (0 books), Puja (0 books), Pari (0 books), Pari (0 books)\n\nWe visit Pari and check her connections:\nPari is not connected to any other scholar.\n\nQueue: Puja (0 books), Pari (0 books)\n\nNext, we visit Puja and check her connections:\nPuja is connected to Pam.\n\nQueue: Pari (0 books), Pam (0 books), Pari (0 books)\n\nWe visit Pari again and check her connections:\nPari is not connected to any other scholar.\n\nQueue: Pam (0 books), Pari (0 books)\n\nFinally, we visit Pam and check her connections:\nPam is not connected to any other scholar.\n\nQueue: Pari (0 books)\n\nSince there are no more scholars left in the queue, we stop the BFS.\n\nBased on the BFS, the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books (Max) is: \n\nAmir, Pari, Pam\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari, Pam"
