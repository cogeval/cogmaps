Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node and set the distance from Amir to 0.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Check if the scholar is donating books.\n     - If yes, record the number of books and the scholar's name.\n     - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar.\n     - Set the distance of the connected scholars to the current distance + 1.\n5. Once the queue is empty, we will have the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nApplying the algorithm:\n\n1. Start with Amir and set the distance from Amir to 0.\n2. Enqueue Amir.\n3. Mark Amir as visited.\n4. Amir is not donating books.\n5. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Set the distance of Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to 1.\n7. Dequeue Reza.\n8. Reza is not donating books.\n9. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n10. Set the distance of Moin and Pari to 2.\n11. Dequeue Moin.\n12. Moin is not donating books.\n13. Enqueue Pari.\n14. Set the distance of Pari to 3.\n15. Dequeue Pari.\n16. Pari is not donating books.\n17. Enqueue Puja.\n18. Set the distance of Puja to 4.\n19. Dequeue Puja.\n20. Puja is donating books.\n21. Record the number of books (50) and the scholar's name (Puja).\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja"
