Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n4. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n5. Add Amir to the visited set.\n6. Create a dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each connected scholar.\n7. Set the shortest path from Amir to Amir as an empty list.\n8. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is the person donating the maximum number of books (Max), return the shortest path from Amir to Max.\n   c. Otherwise, iterate through all the scholars connected to the current scholar:\n      i. If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n         - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n         - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n         - Set the shortest path from Amir to the connected scholar as the shortest path from Amir to the current scholar, appended with the connected scholar.\n9. If no path is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to Max is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari, Moin, Reza, Jing, Max"
