Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the starting node and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Remove the first node from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_scholar\".\n   b. If \"current_scholar\" is the person donating the maximum number of books (Max), stop the search and return the path from Amir to Max.\n   c. Otherwise, add \"current_scholar\" to the visited set.\n   d. Find all the scholars connected to \"current_scholar\" who have not been visited yet. Add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n   e. Repeat steps a-d until the queue is empty or Max is found.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Amir to Max is:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
