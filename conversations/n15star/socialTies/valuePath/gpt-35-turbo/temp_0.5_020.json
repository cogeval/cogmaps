Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is donating books. If yes, add them to the queue.\n3. If the queue is empty, there is no path from Amir to any scholar donating books. In this case, the answer is \"No path found.\"\n4. If the queue is not empty, remove the first scholar from the queue and check if they are donating the maximum number of books. If yes, the answer is the path from Amir to this scholar.\n5. If the scholar is not donating the maximum number of books, add their connected scholars (who have not been visited before) to the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the maximum number of books donor is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's go through the process step by step:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nQueue: [Amir]\n\nStep 2: Check if Amir is connected to any scholar donating books.\nAmir is not connected to any scholar donating books.\n\nStep 3: Queue is empty. No path found.\n\nAnswer: No path found."
