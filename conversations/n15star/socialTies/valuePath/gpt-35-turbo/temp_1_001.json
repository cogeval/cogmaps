Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We start from Amir and explore all connected scholars level by level until we reach the person with the maximum number of books. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books and set it to 0.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books and set it to None.\n5. Start a while loop until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has not been visited:\n      i. Add the scholar to the visited set.\n      ii. Check if the scholar is donating books.\n          - If yes, compare the number of books with the current maximum. If it is greater, update the maximum and the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n      iii. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar (who have not been visited yet).\n6. Once the queue is empty, return the path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing the given connections, we will follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
