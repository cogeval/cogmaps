Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Puja is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim, who is donating 50 books (the maximum).\n \nThe shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
