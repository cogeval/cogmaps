Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will continue exploring the scholars connected to the current scholar until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the path length from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books donated.\n5. Initialize a variable to store the name of the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Start a while loop to explore each scholar in the queue:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the name of the scholar.\n   - If the current scholar is the one donating the maximum number of books, stop the loop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar (if they haven't been visited before) and update their path length.\n7. Start from the scholar donating the maximum number of books and backtrack the path by following the path length dictionary until Amir is reached. \n8. Return the list of scholars in the shortest path, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
