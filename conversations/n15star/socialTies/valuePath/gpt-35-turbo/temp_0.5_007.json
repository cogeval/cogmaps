Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections: \n   - Reza's connections: Moin and Pari.\n   - Moin's connections: Pari.\n   - Pari's connections: No further connections.\n   - Puja's connections: Pam.\n4. Check the connections of each of the scholars with connections from step 3:\n   - Pam's connections: No further connections.\n5. Since there are no further connections, we have reached the end of the search.\n6. The scholar who is donating the maximum number of books is Max, who is connected to Sara and Nisha.\n7. The shortest path from Amir to Max is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
