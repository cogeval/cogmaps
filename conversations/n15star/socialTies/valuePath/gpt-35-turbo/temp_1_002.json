Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and traverse the connections until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (50 in this case), we have found the shortest path. Return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark all the enqueued scholars as visited and keep track of the path taken.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar donating the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
