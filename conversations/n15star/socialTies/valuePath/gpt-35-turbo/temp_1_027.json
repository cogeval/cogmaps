Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n3. Create a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n4. Initialize the shortest path dictionary with Amir as the starting point and set its shortest path length as 0.\n5. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n6. Repeat until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, store the scholar's name and break the loop.\n   - Get the neighbors of the current scholar.\n   - For each neighbor:\n     - If the neighbor is not already visited:\n       - Add the neighbor to the shortest path dictionary with its shortest path length as the current scholar's shortest path length + 1.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.\n7.
