Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir into it.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n4. Check if the dequeued scholar is donating books. If yes, store their name and the number of books they are donating.\n5. If the dequeued scholar is not donating books, enqueue all their connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.\n7. Finally, return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir. Mark Amir as visited.\n2. Enqueue Amir.\n3. Dequeue Amir.\n4. Amir is not donating books. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n5. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n6. Dequeue Reza.\n7. Reza is not donating books. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n8. Enqueue Moin and Pari.\n9. Dequeue Moin.\n10. Moin is not donating books. Enqueue Pari.\n11. Enqueue Pari.\n12. Dequeue Pari.\n13. Pari is not donating books.\n14. The queue is empty. The shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books is Amir, Reza, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari"
