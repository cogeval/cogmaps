Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books. If yes, store the scholar's name and the number of books donated.\n   - Check if the scholar has any connections that have not been visited yet. If yes, mark them as visited and enqueue them.\n4. Once the queue is empty, we will have the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
