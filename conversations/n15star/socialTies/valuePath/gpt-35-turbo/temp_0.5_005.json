Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (Max in this case), we have found the shortest path. Return the path from Amir to Max.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and add them to the visited set.\n   - Keep track of the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the person donating the maximum number of books, it means there is no path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the queue and visited set: \n   - Queue: [Amir]\n   - Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. Dequeue Amir from the queue and check his connections:\n   - Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja into the queue and add them to the visited set.\n   - Path: Amir -> Reza, Amir -> Moin, Amir -> Pari, Amir -> Puja\n\n3. Dequeue Reza from the queue and check his connections:\n   - Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n   - Enqueue Moin and Pari into the queue (Puja is already visited).\n   - Path: Amir -> Reza -> Moin, Amir -> Reza -> Pari\n\n4. Dequeue Moin from the queue and check his connections:\n   - Moin is connected to Pari.\n   - Enqueue Pari into the queue (Puja and Pari are already visited).\n   - Path: Amir -> Reza -> Moin -> Pari\n\n5. Dequeue Pari from the queue and check her connections:\n   - Pari is not connected to any unvisited scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\n6. Dequeue Puja from the queue and check her connections:\n   - Puja is connected to Pam (who is donating the maximum number of books).\n   - We have found the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Return the path: Amir -> Puja -> Pam\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam"
