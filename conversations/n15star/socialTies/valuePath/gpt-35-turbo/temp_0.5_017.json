Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty list to store the path.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is donating books.\n   - If yes, add the scholar to the path list and stop the search.\n   - If no, enqueue all the connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n5. Return the path list.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir. (Amir)\n2. Enqueue Amir. Queue: [Amir]\n3. Dequeue Amir. Amir is not donating books. Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.
