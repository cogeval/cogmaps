Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Check if any of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books. If yes, end the search and return the path.\n3. If none of Amir's connections are donating the maximum number of books, add Amir's connections to the queue.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the maximum number of books donor is found.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Amir's connections are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n3. Add Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja to the queue.\n4. Check Reza. Reza's connections are Moin and Pari. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n5. Check Moin. Moin's connection is Pari. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Check Pari. Pari's connections are Moin. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n7. Check Puja. Puja's connections are Pam. None of them are donating the maximum number of books.\n8. The queue is now empty.\n\nSince we have searched all possible paths from Amir, and none of the connections are donating the maximum number of books, we cannot find a path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books."
