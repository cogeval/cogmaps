Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a variable `current_max` to track the maximum number of books donated.\n5. Initialize a variable `donor_max` to track the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n6. Start the breadth-first search:\n   7. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   8. Add the dequeued scholar to the visited list.\n   9. Check if the scholar is donating books:\n      10. If yes, update `current_max` and `donor_max` if the number of books donated is greater than `current_max`.\n   11. Enqueue the connected scholars who are not already visited.\n12. Repeat steps 7 to 11 until the queue is empty.\n13. The scholar at the end of the path to the `donor_max` will be the one donating the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's implement this algorithm and find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
