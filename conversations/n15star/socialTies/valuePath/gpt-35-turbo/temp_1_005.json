Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the starting point.\n2. Initialize an empty queue and add Amir to it.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   2. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   3. Check if the scholar is donating the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to the scholar.\n   4. If not, add all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar to the queue and update the shortest path dictionary.\n6. If no path is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow let's go through the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar donating the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the starting point.\n2. Queue: [Amir]\n3. Visited: {Amir}\n4. Shortest Path: {Amir: [Amir]}\n5. Dequeue Amir.\n6. Amir is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Amir is connected to: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n   - Queue: [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   - Shortest Path: {Amir: [Amir], Reza: [Amir, Reza], Moin: [Amir, Moin], Pari: [Amir, Pari], Puja: [Amir, Puja]}\n7. Dequeue Reza.\n8. Reza is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Reza is connected to: Moin and Pari.\n   - Queue: [Moin, Pari, Moin, Pari]\n   - Shortest Path: {Amir: [Amir], Reza: [Amir, Reza], Moin: [Amir, Moin, Reza], Pari: [Amir, Pari, Reza], Puja: [Amir, Puja]}\n9. Dequeue Moin.\n10. Moin is not donating the maximum number of books.\n    - Moin is connected to: Pari.\n    - Queue: [Pari, Pari, Pari]\n    - Shortest Path: {Amir: [Amir], Reza: [Amir, Reza], Moin: [Amir, Moin, Reza], Pari: [Amir, Pari, Reza, Moin], Puja: [Amir, Puja]}\n11.
