Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar is donating. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Create an empty visited set and add Amir to it.\n3. Create an empty distance dictionary and set the distance of Amir to 0.\n4. Create an empty donation dictionary to keep track of the number of books each scholar is donating.\n5. Create an empty path dictionary to keep track of the path from Amir to each scholar.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar:\n      - If the scholar has not been visited:\n        - Enqueue the scholar.\n        - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n        - Update the distance of the scholar as the distance of the dequeued scholar plus 1.\n        - Update the path of the scholar as the path of the dequeued scholar plus the scholar's name.\n        - If the scholar is donating books, update the donation dictionary with the number of books.\n7. Find the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books from the donation dictionary.\n8. Retrieve the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum donation from the path dictionary.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari"
