Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will continue exploring the connections until we find the person who is donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of Reza: Moin and Pari.\n4. Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n5. Check the connections of Pari: No further connections.\n6. Check the connections of Puja: Pam.\n7. Check the connections of Pam: No further connections.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections from Amir. Now, let's check the connections of Wim, Raj, and Jing as they are connected to Amir's connections.\n\n8. Check the connections of Wim: Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n9. Check the connections of Wei: Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n10. Check the connections of Kim: Pam.\n11. Check the connections of Puja: Pam.\n12. Check the connections of Pam: No further connections.\n\n13. Check the connections of Raj: Nisha, Ian, Sara, and Kim.\n14. Check the connections of Nisha: Ian, Sara, and Max.\n15. Check the connections of Ian: Sara and Max.\n16. Check the connections of Sara: Max.\n17. Check the connections of Max: No further connections.\n\n18. Check the connections of Jing: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max.\n19. Check the connections of Reza: Moin and Pari.\n20. Check the connections of Moin: Pari.\n21. Check the connections of Pari: No further connections.\n22. Check the connections of Max: No further connections.\n\nFrom the above steps, we can see that the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is:\n\nAmir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
