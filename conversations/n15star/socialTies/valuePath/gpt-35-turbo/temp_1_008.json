Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from Amir, we will traverse the connections and calculate the number of books each person is donating. We will keep track of the current maximum number of books and the corresponding person. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n2. Initialize the queue with Amir and a distance of 0.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. Set the current maximum number of books to 0 and the corresponding person to None.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n    - Mark the scholar as visited.\n    - Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum.\n        - If yes, update the current maximum number of books and the corresponding person.\n    - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar, along with their distances from Amir.\n6. Repeat steps 5 until the queue is empty.\n\nNow, let's execute these steps:\n\n1. Queue: [Amir (0)]\n2. Visited: {}\n3. Maximum Books: 0 (None)\n\nIteration 1:\n- Dequeue Amir (0)\n- Mark Amir as visited.\n- Check if Amir is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n- Enqueue Reza (1), Moin (1), Pari (1), and Puja (1).\n\nIteration 2:\n- Dequeue Reza (1)\n- Mark Reza as visited.\n- Check if Reza is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n- Enqueue Moin (2) and Pari (2).\n\nIteration 3:\n- Dequeue Moin (2)\n- Mark Moin as visited.\n- Check if Moin is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n- Enqueue Pari (3).\n\nIteration 4:\n- Dequeue Pari (3)\n- Mark Pari as visited.\n- Check if Pari is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n\nIteration 5:\n- Dequeue Puja (1)\n- Mark Puja as visited.\n- Check if Puja is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n- Enqueue Pam (2).\n\nIteration 6:\n- Dequeue Moin (2)\n- Skip Moin as it is already visited.\n\nIteration 7:\n- Dequeue Pari (3)\n- Skip Pari as it is already visited.\n\nIteration 8:\n- Dequeue Pam (2)\n- Mark Pam as visited.\n- Check if Pam is donating more books than the current maximum (0 > 0).\n  - No, skip the update.\n\nAt this point, the queue is empty, and we have the final maximum number of books and the corresponding person. The shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari"
