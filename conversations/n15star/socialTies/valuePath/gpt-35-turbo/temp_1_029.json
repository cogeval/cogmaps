Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books donated by each person.\n\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books donated.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum:\n     - Update the maximum number of books donated.\n     - Update the shortest path to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n   - For each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n       - Update the number of books donated by the connected scholar.\n       - Update the path from Amir to the connected scholar.\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's follow these steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Max"
