Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is donating the maximum number of books (Max in this case), return the path from Amir to that scholar.\n   - Otherwise, mark the scholar as visited and enqueue all their connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n   - Keep track of the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n5. If no path is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Enqueue Amir into the queue: Queue = [Amir]\n2. Dequeue Amir from the front of the queue.\n   - Amir is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Mark Amir as visited.\n   - Enqueue Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja into the queue: Queue = [Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   - Update the path: Path = [Amir]\n3. Dequeue Reza from the front of the queue.\n   - Reza is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Mark Reza as visited.\n   - Enqueue Moin and Pari into the queue: Queue = [Moin, Pari, Puja]\n   - Update the path: Path = [Amir, Reza]\n4. Dequeue Moin from the front of the queue.\n   - Moin is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Mark Moin as visited.\n   - Enqueue Pari into the queue: Queue = [Pari, Puja]\n   - Update the path: Path = [Amir, Reza, Moin]\n5. Dequeue Pari from the front of the queue.\n   - Pari is not donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Mark Pari as visited.\n   - Enqueue Puja into the queue: Queue = [Puja]\n   - Update the path: Path = [Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari]\n6. Dequeue Puja from the front of the queue.\n   - Puja is donating the maximum number of books.\n   - Return the path: Answer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books is: Amir, Reza, Moin, Pari, Puja."
