Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node and set the distance from Amir to 0.\n2. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n4. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue and set it as the current node.\n   - If the current node is the person donating the maximum number of books (Max), stop the search and return the path from Amir to Max.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, do the following steps:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.\n     - Set the distance from the neighbor to the current node as the distance from Amir to the current node plus 1.\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Remember the previous node for each neighbor to reconstruct the path later.\n6. If the search finishes without finding Max, it means there is no path from Amir to Max.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin, Max"
