Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar in a queue until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to the queue.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books donated.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has been visited before. If yes, skip to the next iteration.\n   c. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   d. Check if the scholar is donating more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar donating them.\n   e. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited before.\n6. Repeat steps 5 until the queue is empty.\n\nNow, let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pari, Moin"
