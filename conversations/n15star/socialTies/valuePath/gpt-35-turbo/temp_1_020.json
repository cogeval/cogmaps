Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Reza is connected to Moin and Pari.\n3. Moin is connected to Pari.\n4. Pari is not connected to anyone else who is donating books.\n\nNext, let's identify the connections from Moin, Pari, and Puja:\n\n1. Moin is connected to Pari.\n2. Pari is not connected to anyone else who is donating books.\n3. Puja is connected to Pam and Wei.\n4. Wei is not connected to anyone else who is donating books.\n5. Pam is connected to Kim.\n6. Kim is not connected to anyone else who is donating books.\n\nSince Kim is donating the maximum number of books and is connected to Pam, Puja, and Wei, we need to find a path from Amir to Puja, then from Puja to Pam, and finally from Pam to Kim.\n\nBased on the connections, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is as follows:\n\nAmir, Puja, Pam, Kim\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
