Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will traverse the connections between the scholars until we reach the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n3. Move to the first connection, Reza.\n4. Check the connections of Reza: Moin and Pari.\n5. Move to the first connection, Moin.\n6. Moin has no further connections. Move back to Reza.\n7. Move to the second connection of Reza, Pari.\n8. Pari has no further connections. Move back to Amir.\n9. Move to the second connection of Amir, Moin.\n10. Moin has no further connections. Move back to Amir.\n11. Move to the third connection of Amir, Pari.\n12. Pari has no further connections. Move back to Amir.\n13. Move to the fourth connection of Amir, Puja.\n14. Check the connections of Puja: Pam, Kim, and Wei.\n15. Move to the first connection, Pam.\n16. Pam has no further connections. Move back to Puja.\n17. Move to the second connection of Puja, Kim.\n18. Check the connections of Kim: Pam.\n19. Kim has no further connections. Move back to Puja.\n20. Move to the third connection of Puja, Wei.\n21. Wei has no further connections. Move back to Puja.\n22. Move back to Amir.\n23. Now, we have explored all possible connections from Amir and their connections, and we have not yet found the person donating the maximum number of books.\n24. Let's move to the second closest connection of Amir, Reza.\n25. Reza has already been explored, so we skip it.\n26. Next, we move to the third closest connection of Amir, Pari.\n27. Pari has already been explored, so we skip it.\n28. Finally, we move to the fourth closest connection of Amir, Puja.\n29. Puja has already been explored, so we skip it.\n30. Since we have explored all the connections and their connections but have not found the person donating the maximum number of books, we conclude that there is no path from Amir to the person donating the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books."
