Find the shortest path to Soheil from each of these students.\n   - Salma is connected to Noah, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha. Anisha is connected to Abdul, Durga, and Ajit. Ajit is connected to Durga and Anisha. Durga is connected to Pierre, Abdul, and Ajit. Abdul is connected to Pierre, Durga, and Ajit. Pierre is connected to Abdul, Durga, and Soheil. So, the path is Vivian -> Salma -> Pierre -> Soheil.\n   - Shanshan is connected to Salma, Vadim, and Noah. The shortest path from here is the same as from Salma.\n   - Vadim is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, and Noah. The shortest path from here is the same as from Salma.\n   - Gongxue is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice. The path is Vivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil.\n4. Compare the paths and choose the one with the most reward: Vivian -> Salma -> Pierre -> Soheil is a 3-step path, whereas Vivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil is a 2-step path. The shorter path yields the most reward.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil"
