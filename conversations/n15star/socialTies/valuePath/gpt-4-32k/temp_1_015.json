Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

These are: Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n\nStep 2: Check if Kim is among these scholars. If not, identify the scholars connected to each of Amir's direct connections.\n\nStep 3: The scholars connected to Reza are Moin and Pari. The scholars connected to Moin are Reza and Pari. The scholars connected to Pari are Amir, Reza, Moin, and Jing. The scholars connected to Puja are Amir, Wim, Wei, and Pam.\n\nStep 4: Check if Kim is among these scholars. If not, identify the scholars connected to each of these connections.\n\nStep 5: The scholars connected to Jing are Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. The scholars connected to Wim are Wei, Kim, Puja, and Pam. The scholars connected to Wei are Wim, Kim, Puja, and Pam.\n\nStep 6: Kim is directly connected to Wim and Wei. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim would go through either Puja to Wim to Kim or Puja to Wei to Kim. Since both paths have the same length, we could choose any of them.\n\nFinal outcome:\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Wim, Kim"
