Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to the person who is donating the maximum number of books, who is Kim, with 50 books.\n\n1. Start at Amir, who is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. None of these scholars is Kim, so look at their connections.\n3. Reza and Moin are connected to Pari, so they won't lead to Kim.\n4. Pari is a dead end, with no other connections listed.\n5. Puja, however, is connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is connected to Kim. \n\nBased on these connections, the shortest path from Amir to Kim (the person donating the maximum number of books) is: Amir -> Puja -> Pam -> Kim.\n\nTherefore, the list of scholars in order would be Amir, Puja, Pam, and Kim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja, Pam, Kim"
