Noah, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Anisha are connected to each other. Solomon, Soheil, Gongxue, and Alice are connected to each other. Abdul, Durga, Ajit, and Anisha are connected to each other. Salma, Shanshan, and Vadim are connected to each other. Soheil is connected to Alice. Durga, Ajit and Anisha are connected to each other. Shanshan is connected to Vadim. Gongxue is connected to Alice. Ajit is connected to Anisha. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 10 for connecting with Soheil. From Vivian what is the connection path that yields the most reward? Please list the student names in order, separated by commas."

Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n\nStep 2: Identify connections from Vivian's connections that could lead to Soheil.\n- Salma is connected to Noah, Shanshan, and Vadim.\n- Shanshan is connected to Noah, Salma, Vadim, and Anisha.\n- Vadim is connected to Noah, Salma, Shanshan, and Anisha.\n- Gongxue is connected to Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n\nStep 3: Identify connections from the second layer of connections that could lead to Soheil.\n- Noah is not connected to Soheil directly.\n- Anisha is connected to Abdul, Durga, and Ajit.\n- Paul is not connected to Soheil directly.\n- Solomon is connected to Soheil.\n- Alice is connected to Soheil.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate connection paths from Vivian to Soheil.\n- Vivian -> Salma -> Noah (No Soheil connection)\n- Vivian -> Salma -> Shanshan -> Anisha -> Abdul, Durga, or Ajit (No Soheil connection)\n- Vivian -> Shanshan -> Anisha -> Abdul, Durga, or Ajit (No Soheil connection)\n- Vivian -> Vadim -> Anisha -> Abdul, Durga, or Ajit (No Soheil connection)\n- Vivian -> Gongxue -> Solomon -> Soheil\n- Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil\n\nStep 5: Choose the connection path that yields the most reward.\nThe connection paths from Vivian to Soheil are:\n- Vivian -> Gongxue -> Solomon -> Soheil (3 connections)\n- Vivian -> Gongxue -> Alice -> Soheil (3 connections)\n\nBoth paths have the same length, so either can be chosen.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Solomon, Soheil"
