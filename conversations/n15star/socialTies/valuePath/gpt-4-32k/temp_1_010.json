Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is directly connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Puja.\n2. Kim is not in this list, so we'll need to look at the connections of these scholars.\n\nChecking each of Amir's connections:\n1. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is not in this list.\n2. Moin is connected to Pari. Kim is not in this list.\n3. Pari has no other connections, and thus, cannot lead us to Kim.\n4.
