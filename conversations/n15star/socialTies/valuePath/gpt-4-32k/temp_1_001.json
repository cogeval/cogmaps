First, we look at the connections Vivian has: Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n2. Next, we check which of these connections lead to Soheil:\n   a. Salma is connected to Shanshan and Vadim, but not Soheil.\n   b. Shanshan is connected to Salma, Vadim, and Noah, but not Soheil.\n   c. Vadim is connected to Salma, Shanshan, and Noah, but not Soheil.\n   d. Gongxue is connected to Vivian, Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, Paul, Solomon, Soheil, and Alice.\n\n3. Gongxue is directly connected to Soheil. This is the shortest connection path from Vivian to Soheil.\n\nThe connection path that yields the most reward from Vivian is: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil.\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil"
