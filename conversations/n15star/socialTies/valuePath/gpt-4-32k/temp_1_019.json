Vivian is connected to Salma, Shanshan, Vadim, and Gongxue.\n\nNow let's see the connections of these students to Soheil:\n1. Salma is connected to Soheil through Noah's group.\n2. Shanshan and Vadim are not directly connected to Soheil.\n3. Gongxue is connected to Soheil through Paul's group and Solomon's group.\n\nSince connecting to Soheil yields the most reward, we choose the shortest path:\nVivian -> Gongxue -> Soheil\n\nAnswer: Vivian, Gongxue, Soheil"
