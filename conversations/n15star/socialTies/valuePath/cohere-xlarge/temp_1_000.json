Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I will not go into the details of regular expression. You can refer to this post.\n\nNow, let's get back to the problem. If you look at the regular expression of the output, you will find that the names are separated by commas.

You will not know how many books he is donating, but at least you know that he is the shortest path. Now, you will sort the remaining names by their length and then by name.
