Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This algorithm works by assigning a node (Amir) as the source node and finding the shortest path to all other nodes. The algorithm starts by assigning the distance from the source node to itself as 0. Then, it selects the node with the largest distance and updates the distance of all its neighboring nodes. This process continues until all nodes have been visited and the shortest path from the source node to each node has been determined.\n\nIn the given scenario, the person donating the most books is Max. We can use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to Max. The algorithm will start by assigning the distance from Amir to itself as 0. Then, it will select the node with the largest distance (Max) and update the distance of all its neighboring nodes. The algorithm will continue until all nodes have been visited and the shortest path from Amir to Max has been determined.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Max can be represented as a list of scholar names, including Amir, in the following order:\n\n1.
