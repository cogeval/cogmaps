Jing is connected to  Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Kim is donating books in which number of pages range from 100 to 200; donating books in which page ranges from 50 to 100 and donating books in which page numbers ranges from 0 to 50. Donating books of the second kind has more points than donating books of the first kind. For this reason, donating books with zero pages has more points than donating books with page numbers being 0 in the first case and more in the second case. Answer: Donating 2 books ranges 100 to 200 will give the most points (50); donating 3 books ranges 0 - 50 will give 25 and donating none or one book will result in 0 points.\nuser: Whenever a character is connected to Puja, it will start with 85 points and will become 0 after the game. Now, what is the shortest sequence of movements that gives the maximum points from Moin to Amir? Here you have to solve the classic travelling salesman problem, which is a well known NP-hard problem.\nuser: We can look at an example. Donating books of the second kind ranges from 0 to 50 book has +/-3 points and donating books of the first kind has +/-2 points. In summary, if we get the books in the order given below, we get the maximum number of extra points (8.5 points):\nPuja\u2192Max (85)\n-Puja\u2192Reza (80)\n-Ian\u2192Reza (75)\nMoin\u2192Sara (75)\n+Wim\u2192Wei (66)\n-Reza\u2192Wim (66)\n+Reza\u2192Amir (65)\nIan\u2192Sara (10)\n-Puja\u2192Sara (14)\nIn the initial phase, we can use the maximum points to get Puja connected to Amir. Then, we can connect Reza to Wim, and get him connected to Wei. After that, we need either the book with zero pages or books with page numbers ranging from 0 to 50. The final step needs to be a single book with page numbers between 100 to 200."
