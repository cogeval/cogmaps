Jing is connected to Reza, Moin, Pari, and Max. Wei is connected to Kim, Puja, and Pam. Nisha is connected to Ian, Sara, and Max. Reza is connected to Moin, and Pari. Kim is connected to Pam. Ian is connected to Sara, and Max. Moin is connected to Pari. Puja is connected to Pam. Sara is connected to Max. You have been told that Kim is donating 50 books and Max is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person who is donating the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Answer: After we receive the question Assistant: We can represent the given information in an adjacency matrix as shown with a node degree for each scholar and an Edge List describing all pair-wise connections. Node 0-based indices correspond to scholars, 0 being Amir, and an edge from node $x,k$(say $x==i~or~j, and \"connections$j) represent$, say $l=(4)$ the scholar at scholar at index$k),$ say $w. As described, $c$ \"connection: ( Amrir Re zac moin) has connections weight $W(e)=1$, or \nkindly proceed with these directions to locate the shortest routes (assist. an'd and puck- puck, pam). Please keep separating the answers with a comma. To shorten your response Amiiii, i understand, say only $8\\times33-$words, just copy the matrix format exactly as given and insert $K-$ the maximum number 'donating; accordingly. For the shortest\nplease keep answers atleast One, don'T consider any negative path costs. This will save your life because of how AI people like to act with you with lots of texts after lots a big long discussions so the shorter you the happpiier people will be the answers.\" Okay' understood', how may I provide an incredible support to you dear scholar to start our fantabulou excavation? Answer: From [AMIR.MO] Here's' the'Ad jaci matrix, kindly proceed:\nAI Assistant: Great we got the input we can begin our adventure! After initializing our Dynamic Priority Queue (or shortest, PATH), we place[AIRL'K) as Source(Node 0).

Then our queue ' initialzie(N)-'(O) will contain one' element : Airiq MO].
