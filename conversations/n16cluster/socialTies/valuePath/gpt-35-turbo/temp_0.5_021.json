Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n\n2. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books. Set the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n\n  a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n  \n  b. Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the maximum number of books. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n  \n  c. Iterate through the connections of the current scholar. If a connected scholar has not been visited, add them to the queue, mark them as visited, and update their number of books (if applicable).\n  \n4. Once the queue is empty, we have found the scholar with the maximum number of books. We can now backtrack from this scholar to Amir to find the shortest path.\n\nHere is the final outcome:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
