Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and explore each of his connections, then move to their connections, and so on until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if any of Amir's connections have more books than the current maximum number of books.\n3. If yes, update the maximum number of books and note down the name of the person.\n4. Explore Amir's connections one by one.\n5. For each connection, check if they have more books than the current maximum number of books.\n6. If yes, update the maximum number of books and note down the name of the person.\n7. Continue exploring the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the maximum number of books and the path taken.\n8. Repeat this process until we have visited all scholars connected to Amir and their connections.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin"
