Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar one by one until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Continue exploring the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated:\n   - For Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n   - For Eva's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Matt.\n   - For Wei's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Kim, Moin.\n   - For Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Kim's connections: Wei, Reza, Nisha, Moin.\n   - For Moin's connections: Kim, Ian, Puja, Sara.\n   - For Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n   - For Puja's connections: Ian, Moin, Kim, Sara, Pari.\n   - For Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - For Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n   - For Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n5. Keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated:\n   - Amir: 0 books.\n   - Wim: 0 books.\n   - Raj: 0 books.\n   - Jing: 0 books.\n   - Reza: 0 books.\n   - Eva: 0 books.\n   - Wei: 0 books.\n   - Nisha: 0 books.\n   - Kim: 0 books.\n   - Moin: 50 books.\n   - Ian: 0 books.\n   - Puja: 0 books.\n   - Sara: 0 books.\n   - Pari: 0 books.\n   - Pam: 0 books.\n   - Matt: 10 books.\n6. The scholar with the maximum number of books is Moin with 50 books.\n7. The shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Moin."
