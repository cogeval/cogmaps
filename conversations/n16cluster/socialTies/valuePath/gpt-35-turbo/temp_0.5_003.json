Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path to each scholar, starting with Amir and a count of 0 books.\n4. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - For each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n       - Update the shortest path to the connected scholar by adding the current scholar to the path and incrementing the book count by the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n6. The shortest path to the scholar with the maximum number of books will be the shortest path stored in the dictionary for that scholar.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given connections, we find that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
