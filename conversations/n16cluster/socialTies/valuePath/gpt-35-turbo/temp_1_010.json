Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and traverse the scholars in a breadth-first manner until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's create a queue to store the scholars to be visited and a dictionary to keep track of the connections and the number of books each person has. We will also initialize a visited set to avoid visiting the same person multiple times.\n\n1. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Create an empty visited set and add Amir to it.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store connections and the number of books for each person.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_books` to 0 and a variable `max_books_person` to an empty string.\n5. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   6. Dequeue a person from the front of the queue and call it `current_person`.\n   7. Check if `current_person` has more books than `max_books`. If yes, update `max_books` with the number of books of `current_person` and update `max_books_person` with `current_person`.\n   8. Iterate over the connections of `current_person` and check if each person is not in the visited set:\n      - If the person is not in the visited set, enqueue the person, add it to the visited set, and update the connection and book count in the dictionary.\n9. Print the scholar names in order, starting from Amir and separated by commas, until reaching the `max_books_person`.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin, Ian"
