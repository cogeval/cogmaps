Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start by initializing a queue with Amir as the starting node and a visited set to keep track of the visited nodes. We will also create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n\n1. Initialize the queue with Amir: queue = [Amir]\n2. Initialize the visited set: visited = set()\n3. Initialize the dictionary to store the number of books: books = {Amir: 0}\n4. Initialize the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books: max_books = 0, max_scholar = None\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue: current_scholar = queue.pop(0)\n   - Add the current scholar to the visited set: visited.add(current_scholar)\n   - Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the current maximum:\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books: max_books = books[current_scholar], max_scholar = current_scholar\n   - Iterate through the scholars connected to the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar is not visited:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue: queue.append(connected_scholar)\n       - Update the number of books the connected scholar has donated: books[connected_scholar] = books[current_scholar] + donated_books[connected_scholar]\n6. Print the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books: Answer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin\n\nNote: The donated_books dictionary should contain the number of books each scholar has donated. In this case, Moin has donated 50 books and Matt has donated 10 books."
