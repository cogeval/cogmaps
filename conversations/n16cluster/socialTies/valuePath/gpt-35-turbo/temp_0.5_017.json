Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Wim (distance 1)\n2. Raj (distance 1)\n3. Jing (distance 1)\n4. Reza (distance 1)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distances from each of these scholars to the scholars they are connected to:\n\n- For Wim:\n  - Amir (distance 1)\n  - Raj (distance 2)\n  - Jing (distance 2)\n  - Eva (distance 2)\n\n- For Raj:\n  - Amir (distance 1)\n  - Wim (distance 2)\n  - Jing (distance 2)\n  - Wei (distance 2)\n\n- For Jing:\n  - Amir (distance 1)\n  - Wim (distance 2)\n  - Raj (distance 2)\n  - Pam (distance 2)\n\n- For Reza:\n  - Amir (distance 1)\n  - Kim (distance 2)\n  - Nisha (distance 2)\n  - Wei (distance 2)\n\nContinuing this process, we calculate the distances for the remaining scholars:\n\n- For Wei:\n  - Nisha (distance 1)\n  - Reza (distance 2)\n  - Kim (distance 2)\n  - Raj (distance 3)\n\n- For Nisha:\n  - Wei (distance 1)\n  - Reza (distance 2)\n  - Kim (distance 2)\n  - Sara (distance 2)\n\n- For Kim:\n  - Wei (distance 2)\n  - Nisha (distance 2)\n  - Reza (distance 1)\n  - Moin (distance 2)\n\n- For Ian:\n  - Moin (distance 2)\n  - Puja (distance 3)\n  - Sara (distance 3)\n  - Matt (distance 3)\n\n- For Moin:\n  - Ian (distance 2)\n  - Puja (distance 2)\n  - Kim (distance 2)\n  - Sara (distance 1)\n\n- For Puja:\n  - Pari (distance 2)\n  - Ian (distance 3)\n  - Sara (distance 2)\n  - Moin (distance 2)\n\n- For Sara:\n  - Ian (distance 3)\n  - Moin (distance 1)\n  - Puja (distance 2)\n  - Nisha (distance 2)\n\n- For Pari:\n  - Pam (distance 1)\n  - Matt (distance 2)\n  - Eva (distance 2)\n  - Puja (distance 2)\n\n- For Pam:\n  - Jing (distance 2)\n  - Pari (distance 1)\n  - Matt (distance 1)\n  - Eva (distance 1)\n\n- For Matt:\n  - Pari (distance 2)\n  - Pam (distance 1)\n  - Eva (distance 1)\n  - Ian (distance 3)\n\n- For Eva:\n  - Pari (distance 2)\n  - Pam (distance 1)\n  - Matt (distance 1)\n  - Wim (distance 2)\n\nBased on the distances, we can see that the scholar with the maximum number of books is Moin, who is at a distance of 2 from Amir.
