Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start by creating a graph representing the connections between the scholars and their respective book donations. Then, we will perform BFS starting from Amir, keeping track of the number of books donated by each scholar. Finally, we will select the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with the scholars as nodes and their connections as edges. Assign the number of books donated by each scholar as a property to the respective node.\n\n2. Initialize an empty queue and an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n3. Enqueue Amir and mark him as visited.\n\n4. Initialize a variable max_books to 0 and a variable max_books_scholar to an empty string.\n\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the number of books donated by the dequeued scholar is greater than max_books, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n\n6. Starting from Amir, reconstruct the shortest path to the scholar with the maximum number of books by following the connections. Store the scholar names in order, including Amir.\n\n7. Output the list of scholars in order, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Matt"
