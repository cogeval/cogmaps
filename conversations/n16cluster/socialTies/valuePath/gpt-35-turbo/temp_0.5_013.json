Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar one by one, keeping track of the shortest path.\n\nStarting from Amir, the connected scholars are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Among these, Wim has the maximum number of books. We will add Wim to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n\nNext, we will explore Wim's connections - Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Among these, Raj has the maximum number of books. We will add Raj to the queue and mark Wim as visited.\n\nContinuing this process, we will explore Raj's connections - Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Among these, Wei has the maximum number of books. We will add Wei to the queue and mark Raj as visited.\n\nNext, we will explore Wei's connections - Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Among these, Nisha has the maximum number of books. We will add Nisha to the queue and mark Wei as visited.\n\nFinally, we will explore Nisha's connections - Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Among these, Sara has the maximum number of books. We will add Sara to the queue and mark Nisha as visited.\n\nSince Sara does not have any connections, we have reached the end of the search. The shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
