Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Let's calculate the number of books donated by each person in the group:\n\nAmir: Unknown\nWim: Unknown\nRaj: Unknown\nJing: Unknown\nReza: Unknown\nWei: Unknown\nNisha: Unknown\nKim: Unknown\nIan: Unknown\nMoin: 50 books\nPuja: Unknown\nSara: Unknown\nPari: Unknown\nPam: Unknown\nMatt: 10 books\nEva: Unknown\n\nNow, we need to determine the connections between each scholar. Based on the provided information, the connections are as follows:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\nRaj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\nNisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\nReza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\nKim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\nIan is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\nMoin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\nPuja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\nSara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\nPam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\nMatt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\nEva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nNow, let's find the person with the maximum number of books. Based on the information given, Moin has donated 50 books, which is the maximum.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Moin, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections to other scholars and keep track of the shortest path.\n\nBased on the provided connections, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is:\nAmir -> Reza -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
