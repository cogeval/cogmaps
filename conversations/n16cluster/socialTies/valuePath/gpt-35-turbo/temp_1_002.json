Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create a queue to store the scholars in the search order and a set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar has the maximum number of books.\n   - If yes, return the list of scholars visited so far, including Amir.\n   - If not, add all the connected scholars of the current scholar to the queue (if they are not already visited) and mark them as visited.\n\nUsing the given connections, we can start the search from Amir and check the number of books donated by each scholar until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin"
