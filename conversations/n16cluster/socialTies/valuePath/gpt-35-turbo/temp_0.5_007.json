Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections: \n   - For Wim: Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Check the connections of each of the scholars from step 3:\n   - For Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n   - For Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n   - For Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n5. Check the connections of each of the scholars from step 4:\n   - For Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n   - For Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - For Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n   - For Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n6. Check the connections of each of the scholars from step 5:\n   - For Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n   - For Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n   - For Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n7. Check the connections of each of the scholars from step 6:\n   - For Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n\nBased on the connections explored, the scholar with the maximum number of books is Moin, who is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
