Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the shortest path to each scholar and update it as we explore the connections.\n\nStarting from Amir, the shortest path to each scholar is as follows:\n\nAmir: 0\nWim: 1\nRaj: 1\nJing: 1\nReza: 1\nEva: 2\nWei: 2\nKim: 3\nMoin: 3\nNisha: 3\nIan: 3\nPuja: 4\nSara: 4\nPari: 4\nPam: 2\nMatt: 3\n\nFrom the shortest paths, we can see that the scholar with the maximum number of books is Puja, who is at a distance of 4 from Amir.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Answer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Puja"
