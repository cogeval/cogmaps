Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will create a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path from Amir to this scholar.\n   c. If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue their connected scholars.\n4. If no scholar with the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1.
