Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the shortest path.\n   - Add all the scholars connected to the current scholar (excluding the ones already visited) to the queue.\n4.
