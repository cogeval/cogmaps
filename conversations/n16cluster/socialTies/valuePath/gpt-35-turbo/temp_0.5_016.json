Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. Let's begin:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the starting point and create an empty queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n- Starting point: Amir\n- Queue: [Amir]\n\nStep 2: Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars and a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n- Visited scholars: {}\n- Books donated: {Amir: 0}\n\nStep 3: While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: [Amir]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n- Dequeued scholar: Amir\n\nStep 5: If the dequeued scholar has not been visited, proceed to step 6. Otherwise, skip to step 8.\n- Amir has not been visited.\n\nStep 6: Mark the dequeued scholar as visited and update the number of books donated by the dequeued scholar.\n- Visited scholars: {Amir}\n- Books donated: {Amir: 0}\n\nStep 7: Enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar who have not been visited.\n- Enqueued scholars: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n\nStep 8: If the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n- Dequeued scholar: Wim\n\nStep 5: Wim has already been visited, so skip to step 8.\n\nStep 8: If the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: [Raj, Jing, Reza]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n- Dequeued scholar: Raj\n\nStep 5: Raj has already been visited, so skip to step 8.\n\nStep 8: If the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: [Jing, Reza]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n- Dequeued scholar: Jing\n\nStep 5: Jing has already been visited, so skip to step 8.\n\nStep 8: If the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: [Reza]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n- Dequeued scholar: Reza\n\nStep 5: Reza has already been visited, so skip to step 8.\n\nStep 8: If the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n- Queue: []\n\nStep 9: The breadth-first search is complete. Now, we need to find the scholar with the maximum number of books donated.\n\nStep 10: Based on the given information, we know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Since Moin has donated the maximum number of books, we can conclude that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAmir, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
