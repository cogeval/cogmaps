Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The weight of each edge will be the number of books donated by the corresponding scholar.\n\nLet's list down the connections and donations:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\nRaj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\nNisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\nReza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\nKim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\nIan is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\nMoin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\nPuja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\nSara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\nPam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\nMatt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\nEva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nMoin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n5. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n7. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that Moin has the maximum number of books (50) and is connected to Ian.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin"
