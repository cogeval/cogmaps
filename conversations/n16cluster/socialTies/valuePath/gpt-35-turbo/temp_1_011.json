Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored. Start by enqueueing Amir.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar. Set Amir's donation count to 0.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   c. Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum donation count. If yes, update the maximum donation count and store the scholar's name.\n   d. Check the connections of the current scholar. Enqueue any unvisited connected scholars and update their donation count by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n5. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, including Amir.\n\nNow, let's implement this algorithm and find the shortest path from Amir:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Moin"
