Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and visit his connections one by one, keeping track of the distance from Amir to each person.\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir as the current person.\nStep 2: Check if Amir has any connections.\n  - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \nStep 3: Assign a distance of 1 to each of Amir's connections and add them to the queue.\n  - Queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nStep 4: Take the first person from the queue (Wim) and check their connections.\n  - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. \nStep 5: Assign a distance of 2 to each of Wim's connections that have not been visited before (Raj, Jing, Eva) and add them to the queue.\n  - Queue: Raj, Jing, Reza, Raj, Jing, Eva\nStep 6: Take the next person from the queue (Raj) and repeat step 5.\n  - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n  - Queue: Jing, Reza, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nStep 7: Repeat step 6 until the queue is empty, visiting each person's connections and assigning distances.\n\nAfter going through all the connections and assigning distances, we can see that the person with the maximum number of books is Nisha. To reach Nisha from Amir, the shortest path would be: Amir, Raj, Wei, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Nisha."
