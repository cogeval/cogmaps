Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, I will explore the connections to each person and keep track of the distance from Amir to each person. Additionally, I will keep track of the number of books each person has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Set Amir as the starting point and initialize an empty queue and an empty dictionary to track the distance and books.\n2. Enqueue Amir and set its distance to 0 and books to 0 in the dictionary.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a person from the queue.\n   b. Check if the person has more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum books and the person with the maximum books.\n   c. Explore the connections of the person and enqueue any unvisited connected person to the queue.\n   d. For each connected person, update the distance and books in the dictionary if the distance is shorter or the person has more books than the previous record.\n4. Once the queue is empty, retrieve the path from Amir to the person with the maximum books by backtracking from the maximum books person to Amir using the recorded distances.\n\nNow let me execute the steps and provide you with the answer."
