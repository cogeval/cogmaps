Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar one by one, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nStarting from Amir, the initial number of books is 0. We will use a queue data structure to perform the breadth-first search. We will enqueue Amir and mark him as visited. Then, we will dequeue the first scholar from the queue and check if they have donated more books than the current maximum number of books. If so, we update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books. \n\nWe repeat this process until we have explored all the connected scholars. Finally, we have the scholar with the maximum number of books. \n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n   - Queue: [Amir]\n   - Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. Initialize variables for the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - MaxBooks: 0\n   - ScholarWithMaxBooks: None\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (current_scholar).\n\n4. Check if the current_scholar has donated more books than the MaxBooks:\n   - If yes, update MaxBooks and ScholarWithMaxBooks.\n   - If no, continue to the next scholar in the queue.\n\n5. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current_scholar who have not been visited yet:\n   - Check the connections of the current_scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar is not in the visited set, enqueue them and mark them as visited.\n     - Update the number of books for each connected scholar.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.\n\n7. The ScholarWithMaxBooks is the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara"
