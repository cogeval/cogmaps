Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar one by one, keeping track of the path length.\n\nStarting from Amir, the scholars connected to Amir are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. We will explore each of them in the following order:\n\n1. Wim: Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Since Eva is not connected to any other scholars, we can ignore her. The remaining connected scholars are Raj and Jing. We will explore them in the next steps.\n\n2. Raj: Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Wei is not connected to any other scholars, so we can ignore him. The remaining connected scholars are Amir, Wim, and Jing. We will explore them in the next steps.\n\n3. Jing: Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Pam is not connected to any other scholars, so we can ignore her. The remaining connected scholars are Amir, Wim, and Raj. We will explore them in the next steps.\n\nNow, let's continue exploring the scholars connected to Wim, Raj, and Jing:\n\n4. Amir: Amir is already visited, so we can ignore him.\n\n5. Wim: Wim is already visited, so we can ignore him.\n\n6. Raj: Raj is already visited, so we can ignore him.\n\n7. Jing: Jing is already visited, so we can ignore him.\n\nSince there are no more connected scholars to explore, we have completed the breadth-first search. The shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: \n\nAmir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Eva, Pari, Matt\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Eva, Pari, Matt"
