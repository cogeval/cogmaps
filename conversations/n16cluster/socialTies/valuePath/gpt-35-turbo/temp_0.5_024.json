Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Moin is donating the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Moin is as follows:\nAmir, Reza, Kim, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
