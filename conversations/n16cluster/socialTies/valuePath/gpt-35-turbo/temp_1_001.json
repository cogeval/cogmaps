Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the number of books each person has donated and return the scholar names in order.\n\nStarting from Amir, the algorithm will look for the shortest path to each connected scholar and calculate the total number of books that can be obtained through that path. The algorithm will continue until it reaches the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars in the order we will explore them.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n3. Initialize the queue with Amir and the number of books he has donated (0).\n4. Initialize the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum number of books. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   c. Enqueue all the connected scholars who haven't been visited yet, along with their respective total number of books donated (adding the number of books donated by the current scholar).\n6. Once the queue is empty, we will have the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. The scholar names will be listed in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Moin"
