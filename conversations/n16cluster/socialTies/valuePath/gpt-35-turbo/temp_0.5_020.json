Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the path length from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n6. Set the path length of Amir as 0.\n7. Set the number of books donated by Amir as 0.\n8. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum number of books.\n     - If yes, update the current maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Explore each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited, enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Update the visited set, path length, and number of books donated for the connected scholar.\n9. Once the queue is empty, we have found the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n10. Return the list of scholars in the shortest path, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin"
