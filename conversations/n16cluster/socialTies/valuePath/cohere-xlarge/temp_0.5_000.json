Peter is connected to Amanda, John, Daisy, and Adam. John is connected to Paul, Daisy, Peter, and Amanda. Daisy is also connected to Amanda, Peter, John, and Maggie. Alisa is connected to Maggie, Jennifer, Adam, and Russell. Maggie is connected to Alisha, Jennifer, Daisy, and Adam. Jennifer is connected to Andrew, Alisha, Adam, and Maggie. Adam is also connected to Alisha, Maggie, Jennifer, and Peter. Andrew is connected to William, Russell, Rose, and Jennifer. William is connected to Sherry, Andrew, Russell, Rose. Russell is connected to Andrew, William, Rose, and Alsiha. Rose is also connected to Andrew, William, Russell, and Bob. Now you are told that Rose can donate $250K while Maggie can donate $500K. Also, if you want to get connected with Amanda, you need to pay $10K to her company. From Paul, what is the path to the person who can donate the most money? Please list the names in order, separated by commas."
