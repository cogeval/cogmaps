Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

At the end, the player that gives the more accurate and consistent answer will be declared the winner. Each friend has a chance of 1 out of n guesses to give the right answer. In each turn, each friend has to guess a letter by clicking on it, so that its length will be reduced (e.g., if the player types \"ba\", it will get 1 right letter correct, and the sentence would be \"ban\"). If the player does not select a right letter, or if the letter that he or she chose does not match any word in the puzzle, then the player will have to guess one more letter. Each letter typed by the player will be displayed in the same color for all friends, except for the one who knows the answer. At the end of the game, the player who has answered the most right questions will win the match.\nWhen you play a game on the platform, you can only view your own statistics: how many points you have won the game and lost, how many moves you have made with the highest score.
