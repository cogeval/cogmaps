Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 3: Check if any of Amir's connections is directly connected to Moin. None of them are.\n\nStep 4: Identify the second-degree connections of Amir (i.e., the connections of Amir's connections) and check if any of them are directly connected to Moin. Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, who is connected to Moin. \n\nStep 5: Formulate the shortest path from Amir to Moin. The shortest path is Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Moin."
