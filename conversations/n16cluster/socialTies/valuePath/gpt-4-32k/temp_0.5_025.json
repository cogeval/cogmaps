Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, it's Moin who is donating 50 books, which is more than Matt's 10 books. \n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. \n\nThe connections of Amir are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n\nNone of them are directly connected to Moin. So, we need to check the connections of Amir's connections. \n\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. None of them are Moin. \n\nRaj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. None of them are Moin. \n\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of them are Moin. \n\nReza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
