Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, the connection paths are as follows: Amir to Wim, Wim to Eva, Eva to Matt, Matt to Ian, and finally, Ian to Moin. This seems to be the shortest path from Amir to Moin. Now let's follow these steps to reach Moin:\n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Move to Wim as he is connected to Amir.\n3. From Wim, move to Eva who is connected to Wim.\n4. From Eva, move to Matt as Matt is connected to Eva.\n5. From Matt, go to Ian as Ian is connected to Matt.\n6. From Ian, finally reach Moin who is connected to Ian.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin."
