Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

None of these scholars are directly connected to Moin, so we need to find their connections. \n3. Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, who is connected to Ian, who is connected to Moin. This path involves 5 steps.\n4. Raj is connected to Wei, who is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin. This path involves 4 steps.\n5. Jing is connected to Pam, who is connected to Pari, who is connected to Puja, who is connected to Moin. This path involves 5 steps.\n6. Reza is connected to Wei, who is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin. This path also involves 4 steps.\n\nSo, the shortest paths from Amir to Moin are through Raj or Reza. We can choose either of these paths as they both involve the same number of steps. For example, we can choose the path through Raj: Amir - Raj - Wei - Kim - Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"
