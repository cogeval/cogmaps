Check if Pam is connected directly to Pari. If so, the shortest path is just Pam and Pari.\n3. If Pam is not directly connected to Pari, we need to explore further.\n4. Look at all the scholars connected to Pam (Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva).\n5. Check if any of these scholars are connected directly to Pari. If so, add Pam, the connected scholar, and Pari to the shortest path.\n6. If none of these scholars are connected directly to Pari, we need to explore further.\n7. For each scholar connected to Pam (Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva), look at all the scholars connected to them.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until we find a connection to Pari or we have explored all possible paths.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at Pam.\n2. Pam is directly connected to Pari, so the shortest path is just Pam and Pari.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Pari"
