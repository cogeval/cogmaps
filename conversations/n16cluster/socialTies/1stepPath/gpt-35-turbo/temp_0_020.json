If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Wim.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Ian).\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are directly connected to Wim. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, followed by the connection, and then Wim.\n5. If not, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Wim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Wim.\n3. Eva's connections are Pari, Pam, Matt, and Ian.\n4. None of Eva's connections are directly connected to Wim.\n5.
