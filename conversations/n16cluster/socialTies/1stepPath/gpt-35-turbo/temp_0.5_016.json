Check if Reza is connected directly to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is just Reza and Amir. The path is Reza, Amir.\n3. If Reza is not directly connected to Amir, check Reza's connections (Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei).\n4. Add Reza's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue (Amir).\n6. Check if this connection is Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Amir.\n7. If Amir is not found, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Amir is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start at Reza.\nStep 2: Reza is not directly connected to Amir.\nStep 3: Reza's connections are Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\nStep 4: Add Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei to the queue: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\nStep 5: Take the first connection from the queue: Amir.\nStep 6: Amir is found. The shortest path is Reza, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir"
