If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Eva.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n4. Add Wim's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if Amir is connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Amir, and Eva.\n6. If not, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Eva) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Eva is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Wim is not connected to Eva.\n3. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Queue: Amir, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n5. Take Amir from the queue.\n6. Amir is connected to Eva.\n   - Shortest path: Wim, Amir, Eva.\n   - Answer: Wim, Amir, Eva."
