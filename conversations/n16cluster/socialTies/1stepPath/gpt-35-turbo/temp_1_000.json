Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the visited scholars. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at Amir.\n2. Explore Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check if Wim is one of the connections. If yes, then the shortest path from Amir to Wim is [Amir, Wim]. If not, proceed to the next step.\n4. Mark Amir as visited and add him to the visited scholars list.\n5. Add Wim to the queue (the next scholar to be explored).\n6. Set Wim's parent as Amir.\n7. Explore Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n8. Check if Amir is one of the connections. Since Amir has already been visited, we can skip it. Proceed to the next connection.\n9. Check if Raj is one of the connections. If yes, then the shortest path from Amir to Wim is [Amir, Raj, Wim]. If not, proceed to the next connection.\n10. Check if Jing is one of the connections. If yes, then the shortest path from Amir to Wim is [Amir, Jing, Wim]. If not, proceed to the next connection.\n11. Check if Eva is one of the connections. If yes, then the shortest path from Amir to Wim is [Amir, Eva, Wim]. If not, proceed to the next step.\n12. Mark Wim as visited and add him to the visited scholars list.\n13. Add Raj, Jing, and Eva to the queue (the next scholars to be explored).\n14. Set their parents as Wim.\n15. Repeat steps 7-14 until Wim is found or the queue becomes empty.\n\nBased on this process, the shortest path from Amir to Wim is: Answer: Amir, Raj, Wim"
