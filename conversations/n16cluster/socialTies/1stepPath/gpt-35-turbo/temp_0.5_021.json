Check if Eva is connected to Pari directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Pari. Answer: Eva, Pari.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari is not directly connected to Eva).\n   - Eva is connected to Pam, Matt, and Wim. We add them to the queue.\n4. Now, check Pam's connections.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. We add Jing and Pari to the queue.\n5. Check Matt's connections.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. We add Ian to the queue.\n6. Check Wim's connections.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. We skip Eva since it's already visited.\n   - Amir and Raj are not connected to Pari. We skip them.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. We skip Amir, Wim, and Raj since they're already visited. We add Pam to the queue.\n7. Check Ian's connections.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara. We skip Moin, Puja, and Kim.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. We add Nisha to the queue.\n8. Check Nisha's connections.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. We skip Wei, Reza, and Kim.\n   - Sara is already visited.\n9. Check Pam's connections again.\n   - Pam is already visited.\n10. Check Pari's connections.\n    - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. We add Puja to the queue.\n11. Check Puja's connections.\n    - Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. We add Moin to the queue.\n12. Check Moin's connections.\n    - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. We skip Ian, Puja, and Kim.\n    - Sara is already visited.\n13. Check Puja's connections again.\n    - Puja is already visited.\n14. Check Matt's connections again.\n    - Matt is already visited.\n15. Check Pari's connections again.\n    - Pari is already visited.\n\nThe shortest path from Eva to Pari is: Eva, Pam, Pari. Answer: Eva, Pam, Pari."
