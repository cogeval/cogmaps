Check if Jing is connected to Raj. If they are connected, we have found the shortest path and can end the search. The path from Jing to Raj would be: Jing, Raj.\n\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Raj, we need to explore their connections. Look at the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n\n4. Since Raj is already in the connections of Jing, we can conclude that the shortest path from Jing to Raj is: Jing, Raj.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj"
