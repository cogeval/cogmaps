If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Matt.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, and Wim.\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, followed by the connection, and then Matt.\n5. If not, check the connections of Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n6. Repeat this process, checking the connections of the connections, until Matt is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Matt.\n3. Eva's connections are Pari, Pam, and Wim.\n4. Pari is not connected to Matt.\n5. Pam is connected to Matt.\n6. The shortest path from Eva to Matt is Eva, Pam, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pam, Matt"
