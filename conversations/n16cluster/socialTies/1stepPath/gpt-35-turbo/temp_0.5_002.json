We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach Jing.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir and mark him as visited.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and call it current_scholar.\n   - If current_scholar is Jing, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, add all unvisited scholars connected to current_scholar to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this step, it means there is no path from Amir to Jing.\n\nLet's go through the algorithm step by step:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir (scholar 1) and mark him as visited.\nVisited: [1]\n\nStep 2: Add Amir (scholar 1) to the queue.\nQueue: [1]\n\nStep 3: While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n\n    - Remove the first scholar from the queue (Amir - scholar 1).\n\n        - Check Amir's connections:\n          - Amir is connected to Wim (scholar 2), Raj (scholar 3), Jing (scholar 4), and Reza (scholar 5).\n          - Wim (scholar 2) is already visited, so skip.\n          - Raj (scholar 3) is already visited, so skip.\n          - Jing (scholar 4) is not visited. Add Jing to the queue and mark him as visited.\n            Visited: [1, 4]\n          - Reza (scholar 5) is already visited, so skip.\n\n    Queue: [4]\n\nStep 3 (continued):\n\n    - Remove the first scholar from the queue (Jing - scholar 4).\n\n        - Check Jing's connections:\n          - Jing is connected to Amir (scholar 1), Wim (scholar 2), Raj (scholar 3), and Pam (scholar 14).\n          - Amir (scholar 1) is already visited, so skip.\n          - Wim (scholar 2) is already visited, so skip.\n          - Raj (scholar 3) is already visited, so skip.\n          - Pam (scholar 14) is already visited, so skip.\n\n    Queue: []\n\nStep 3 (continued):\n\n    - The queue is empty, and we have not found Jing. There is no path from Amir to Jing.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to Jing."
