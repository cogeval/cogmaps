Mark Raj as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue and call it current_scholar.\n   b. If current_scholar is Wim, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to current_scholar that has not been visited yet, do the following:\n      i. Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      ii. Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n      iii. Keep track of the path from Raj to the connected scholar.\n\nApplying the algorithm, we get the following path from Raj to Wim: Raj, Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir, Wim"
