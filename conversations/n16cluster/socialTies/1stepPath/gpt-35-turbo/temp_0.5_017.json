Check if Reza is connected to Wei (scholar number 9). If they are directly connected, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n3. If Reza is not directly connected to Wei, we need to explore the connections of Reza's connections.\n4. Reza is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Kim (scholar number 13), Nisha (scholar number 11), and Wei (scholar number 9).\n5. We will first explore Amir's connections. Amir is connected to Wim (scholar number 2), Raj (scholar number 3), Jing (scholar number 4), and Reza (scholar number 6). Since we have already visited Reza, we can skip it.\n6. Next, we will explore Kim's connections. Kim is connected to Wei (scholar number 9), Nisha (scholar number 11), Reza (scholar number 6), and Moin (scholar number 14). Since Wei is directly connected to Kim, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n7. The shortest path from Reza to Wei is: Reza, Kim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Kim, Wei"
