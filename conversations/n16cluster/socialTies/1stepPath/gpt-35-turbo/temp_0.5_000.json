Take the next scholar from the queue (in this case, Wim).\n7. Check if Wim is connected to Wim. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, Wim.\n8. If not, add Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva) to the queue.\n9. Remove Wim from the queue.\n10. Take the next scholar from the queue (in this case, Raj).\n11.
