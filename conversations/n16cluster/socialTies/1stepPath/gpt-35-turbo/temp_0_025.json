If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Nisha.\n3. If not, check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n4. Since Nisha is not directly connected to Wei, we move to the next level of connections: Nisha's connections.\n5. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Check if any of Nisha's connections are connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Nisha.\n7. If not, move to the next level of connections: Reza, Kim, and Sara's connections.\n8.
