Check if Wim is connected directly to Raj. If so, the shortest path is just Wim and Raj. Return the path [Wim, Raj].\n3. If not, create a queue to keep track of the scholars to be visited. Initialize the queue with Wim.\n4. Create an empty visited list to keep track of the visited scholars.\n5. Create an empty path list to keep track of the current path.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Add the scholar to the visited list.\n   - If the scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Return the current path.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited yet:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the path.\n7. If the loop ends without finding Raj, there is no path from Wim to Raj. Return an empty list.\n\nApplying these steps, we start at Wim and check its connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Since Raj is connected directly to Wim, the shortest path is [Wim, Raj].\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj"
