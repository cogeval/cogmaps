Start with Wim as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited next.\n3. Enqueue Wim into the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 5-7.\n5. Dequeue a node from the queue and assign it to the current node.\n6. If the current node is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n7. If the current node is not Amir, enqueue all the neighbors of the current node that have not been visited yet. Mark each neighbor as visited and set its parent to the current node.\n8. If the queue becomes empty before finding Amir, there is no path from Wim to Amir.\n\nNow let's perform the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from Wim to Amir:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir"
