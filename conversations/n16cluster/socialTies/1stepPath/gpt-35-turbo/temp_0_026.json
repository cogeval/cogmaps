If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Reza.\n3. If not, check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n4. Since Reza is not directly connected to Wei, we need to explore further.\n5. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Reza is directly connected to Nisha, so the shortest path from Wei to Reza is Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Nisha, Reza"
