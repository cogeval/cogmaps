Start with Reza (scholar number 7) as the initial node.\n2. Check if Wei (scholar number 9) is directly connected to Reza. If yes, the path is Reza - Wei. Otherwise, proceed to the next steps.\n3. Check Reza's connections: Amir (1), Kim (8), Nisha (11), and Wei (9).\n4. Create a queue and enqueue the immediate connections of Reza: Amir (1), Kim (8), Nisha (11), and Wei (9).\n5. Dequeue the first node from the queue, which is Amir (1).\n6. Check Amir's connections: Wim (2), Raj (3), Jing (4), and Reza (7).\n7. Enqueue the connections of Amir that are not already visited: Wim (2), Raj (3), Jing (4), and Reza (7).\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Wei is found or the queue is empty.\n9. If Wei is found, the path will be Reza - Amir - Wei. If the queue is empty and Wei is not found, there is no path from Reza to Wei.\n\nFollowing these steps, let's find the shortest path from Reza to Wei:\n\n1. Reza (7)\n2. Amir (1)\n3. Wei (9)\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir, Wei"
