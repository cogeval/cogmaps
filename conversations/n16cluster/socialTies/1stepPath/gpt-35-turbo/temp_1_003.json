We will start with Amir and explore each scholar connected to Amir, then move on to explore each scholar connected to the previously visited scholars until we reach Reza.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Reza:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to the queue.\n\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar to their previous scholar.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n\n    - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    \n    - Check if this scholar is Reza. If yes, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n    \n    - Otherwise, add the scholar to the visited set.\n    \n    - Explore each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n    \n        - If the connected scholar is not in the visited set, enqueue it into the queue.\n        \n        - If the connected scholar is not in the path dictionary, add an entry in the dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the connected scholar as the value.\n        \n5. If Reza is not found, it means there is no path from Amir to Reza.\n\n6. If Reza is found, retrieve the path from the path dictionary by starting from Reza and following the previous scholar entries until reaching Amir. This will give us the shortest path from Amir to Reza.\n\nBased on the given information, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to Reza."
