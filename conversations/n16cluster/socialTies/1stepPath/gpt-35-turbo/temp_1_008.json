Enqueue Raj to the queue and add Raj to the visited set.\n3. Initialize an empty path list.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued scholar is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Add Amir to the path list and break out of the loop.\n   c. Otherwise, add the dequeued scholar to the path list.\n   d. Find all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited yet.\n   e. Enqueue these connected scholars to the queue and add them to the visited set.\n5. Return the path list.\n\nNow let's execute the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir"
