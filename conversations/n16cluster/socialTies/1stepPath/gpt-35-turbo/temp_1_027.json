We will start from Wei and traverse the graph until we reach Kim. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Wei to Kim:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the scholars to visit and a visited set to avoid revisiting the same scholar.\n2. Add Wei to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue (let's call it current_scholar).\n   - Check if the current_scholar is Kim. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, get all the connections of the current_scholar.\n   - For each connected scholar that has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n4. If we have visited all scholars and have not found Kim, then there is no path from Wei to Kim.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can find the shortest path from Wei to Kim.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Raj, Kim"
