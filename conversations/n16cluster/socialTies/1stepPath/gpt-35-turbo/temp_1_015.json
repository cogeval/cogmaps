We'll start by initializing a queue with Jing and a visited set to keep track of the scholars we've already visited. Then, we'll repeatedly dequeue a scholar from the queue and enqueue their connections (if not visited) until we reach Pam. Finally, we'll trace back the path from Pam to Jing using the visited set.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with Jing and the visited set with Jing.\n   - Queue: Jing\n   - Visited: Jing\n\n2. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Jing).\n   - Queue: empty\n   - Visited: Jing\n\n3. Enqueue all unvisited connections of Jing (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam).\n   - Queue: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n\n4. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n   - Queue: Wim, Raj, Pam\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n\n5. Enqueue all unvisited connections of Amir (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n   - Queue: Wim, Raj, Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza\n\n6. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Wim).\n   - Queue: Raj, Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza\n\n7. Enqueue all unvisited connections of Wim (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n   - Queue: Raj, Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza, Eva\n\n8. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Raj).\n   - Queue: Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza, Eva\n\n9. Enqueue all unvisited connections of Raj (Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei).\n   - Queue: Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n   - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza, Eva, Wei\n\n10. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue (Pam).\n    - Queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n    - Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Reza, Eva, Wei\n\n11. Since Pam is the destination, we can stop here.\n\nThe shortest path from Jing to Pam is: Jing, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam"
