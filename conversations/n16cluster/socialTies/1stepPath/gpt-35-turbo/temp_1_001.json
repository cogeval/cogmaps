Create a visited set and add Amir to the set.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the parent of each scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n      i. Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n      ii. Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      iii. Set the parent of the connected scholar as the dequeued scholar in the dictionary.\n5.
