Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars.\n2. Initialize a queue and add Reza to it.\n3. Initialize a visited set and add Reza to it.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path from Reza to each scholar.\n5. Initialize a dictionary to store the previous scholar in the shortest path for each scholar.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n    - If the dequeued scholar is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n    - Otherwise, for each unvisited scholar connected to the dequeued scholar:\n        - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n        - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n        - Update the shortest path and previous scholar dictionaries.\n7. Retrieve the shortest path from the previous scholar dictionary starting from Amir and working backward to Reza.\n8. Return the shortest path as a list of scholar numbers.\n\nNow, let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Reza to Amir.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir"
