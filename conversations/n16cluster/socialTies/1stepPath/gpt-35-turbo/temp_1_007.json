Since Eva is already visited in the connections of Wim, we can skip Eva in the next iterations.\n5. Repeat step 2 and 3 for Amir, Raj, and Jing.\n6. Amir is connected to Wim (already visited), Raj, Jing, and Reza (scholar 5).\n7. Raj is connected to Wim (already visited), Amir (already visited), Jing, and Wei (scholar 8).\n8. Jing is connected to Wim (already visited), Amir (already visited), Raj (already visited), and Pam (scholar 11).\n9. Since Pam is not connected to Eva, we continue the search.\n10. From the connections of Raj, Wei is connected to Nisha (scholar 12), Reza (already visited), Kim (scholar 10), and Raj (already visited).\n11. Since Nisha is not connected to Eva, we continue the search.\n12. From the connections of Jing, Pam is connected to Pari (scholar 13), Matt (scholar 16), Eva (already visited), and Wim (already visited).\n13. Since Eva is already visited, we skip it.\n14. From the connections of Wei, Nisha is connected to Wei (already visited), Reza (already visited), Kim (already visited), and Sara (scholar 7).\n15. Since Sara is connected to Eva, we have found the shortest path from Wim to Eva.\n16. The shortest path is: Wim, Jing, Pam, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Eva"
