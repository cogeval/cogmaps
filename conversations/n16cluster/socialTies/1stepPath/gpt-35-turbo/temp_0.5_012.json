If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Amir.\n3. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the scholar connected to Jing, and Amir.\n4. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Amir. Repeat this process until a connection to Amir is found.\n5. Keep track of the visited scholars to avoid revisiting them.\n6. Once a connection to Amir is found, backtrack the path from Amir to Jing to get the shortest path.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at Jing.\n2. Jing is connected to Amir, so the shortest path is just Jing and Amir.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir"
