Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Add Wei to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Nisha, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, mark the scholar as visited and enqueue all of its connected scholars that have not been visited.\n5. If the search is complete and Nisha has not been found, there is no path from Wei to Nisha.\n\nApplying this algorithm, we get the following steps:\n\n1. Queue: [Wei]\n   Visited: {}\n2. Dequeue Wei.\n3. Add Wei to the Visited set.\n4. Enqueue Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj (Wei's connected scholars).\n   Queue: [Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj]\n   Visited: {Wei}\n5. Dequeue Nisha.\n6. Add Nisha to the Visited set.\n7. Nisha is the destination. Stop the search.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Nisha is Wei, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Nisha"
