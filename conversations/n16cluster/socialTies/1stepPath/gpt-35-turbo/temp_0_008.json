Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Enqueue Raj into the queue and add Raj to the visited set.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the parent of each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Set the parent of the connected scholar as the dequeued scholar in the parent dictionary.\n6. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Raj to Amir.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Amir:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir"
