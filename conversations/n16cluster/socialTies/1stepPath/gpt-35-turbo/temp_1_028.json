Starting from Pam, we will explore each scholar connected to Pam and keep track of the path taken to reach them. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Look at the scholars connected to Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n3. Enqueue Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva, and mark Pam as visited.\n4. Dequeue the first scholar in the queue (Jing).\n5. Check if Jing is the target scholar. If so, the path is complete.\n6. If not, enqueue the scholars connected to Jing (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Reza).\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the target scholar (Jing) is found.\n8. Once the target scholar is found, trace back the path from Jing to Pam.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing"
