If the dequeued scholar is Amir, stop the search and return the path.\n   8. Otherwise, for each unvisited scholar connected to the dequeued scholar, do the following:\n      9. Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n      10. Enqueue the connected scholar.\n      11. Add the connected scholar to the current path.\n12.
