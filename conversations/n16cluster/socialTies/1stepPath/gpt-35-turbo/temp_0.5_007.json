Create a queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the node is Eva, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the node has not been visited:\n     - Mark the node as visited.\n     - Enqueue all the neighbors of the node that have not been visited.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Wim to Eva.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Eva"
