If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Pam.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Since Pam is not directly connected to Jing, we need to explore the connections of Jing's connections.\n5. From Jing's connections, we have Amir, Wim, and Raj.\n6. Check the connections of Amir, Wim, and Raj to see if they are connected to Pam.\n7. Amir is connected to Pam, so the shortest path from Jing to Pam is Jing, Amir, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Pam"
