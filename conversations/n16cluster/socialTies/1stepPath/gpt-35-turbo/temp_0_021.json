Check if Eva is connected to Pari directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Pari.\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Pari, check Eva's connections (Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are directly connected to Pari. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, the directly connected scholar, and Pari.\n5. If none of Eva's connections are directly connected to Pari, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Pari is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Pari.\n3. Eva's connections are Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. None of Eva's connections are directly connected to Pari.\n5. Check the connections of Eva's connections:\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. None of the connections of Eva's connections are directly connected to Pari.\n7. Check the connections of the connections of Eva's connections:\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Matt is already checked.\n   - Eva is already checked.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Puja is already checked.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Kim is already checked.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Raj is already checked.\n8. None of the connections of the connections of Eva's connections are directly connected to Pari.\n9. Continue checking the connections of the connections of the connections of Eva's connections until Pari is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, there is no direct or indirect path from Eva to Pari. Therefore, the shortest path from Eva to Pari does not exist.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from Eva to Pari."
