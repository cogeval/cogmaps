Check if Eva is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Pam.\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Pam, check Eva's connections (Wim, Pari, Matt).\n4. Add Eva's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wim).\n6. Check if Wim is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Wim, and Pam.\n7. If Wim is not directly connected to Pam, add Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Pam is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Pam.\n3. Eva's connections: Wim, Pari, Matt.\n4. Queue: Wim, Pari, Matt.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wim).\n6. Wim is not directly connected to Pam.\n7. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n8. Queue: Pari, Matt, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n9. Take the first scholar from the queue (Pari).\n10.
