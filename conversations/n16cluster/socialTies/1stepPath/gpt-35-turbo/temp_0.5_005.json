Enqueue Wim into the queue and add Wim to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and add them to the visited set.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Wim to Raj.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue: [Wim]\n2. Initialize the visited set: {Wim}\n3. Start the breadth-first search algorithm:\n   - Dequeue Wim, it is not Raj.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (connected to Wim) into the queue: [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\n   - Add Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva to the visited set: {Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva}\n   - Dequeue Amir, it is not Raj.\n   - Enqueue Reza (connected to Amir) into the queue: [Raj, Jing, Eva, Reza]\n   - Add Reza to the visited set: {Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Reza}\n   - Dequeue Raj, it is Raj! We have found the shortest path.\n4. Stop the algorithm.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj"
