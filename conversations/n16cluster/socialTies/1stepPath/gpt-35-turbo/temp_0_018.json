Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n3. Check if Nisha is directly connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Nisha.\n4. If Nisha is not directly connected to Reza, check the connections of Reza's connections.\n5. Reza's connections are Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Among them, Nisha is already checked, so we can skip it.\n6. Check the connections of Amir, Kim, and Wei.\n7. Amir's connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Among them, Nisha is not present.\n8. Kim's connections are Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Among them, Nisha is present. So the shortest path is Reza, Kim, Nisha.\n9. Wei's connections are Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Among them, Nisha is already checked, so we can skip it.\n10. Moin's connections are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Among them, Nisha is not present.\n11. Since we have found the shortest path, we can stop here.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Kim, Nisha"
