Perform BFS starting from Raj to find the shortest path to Wei.\n   - Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n   - Enqueue Raj into the queue.\n   - Add Raj to the visited set.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n     - If the dequeued scholar is Wei, we have found the shortest path. Stop the BFS.\n     - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n     - Add the dequeued scholar to the visited set.\n   - If the BFS completes without finding Wei, there is no path from Raj to Wei.\n\n3.
