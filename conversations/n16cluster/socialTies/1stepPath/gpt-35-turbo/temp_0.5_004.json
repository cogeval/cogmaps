Create a queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create a visited set and add Wim to it.\n4. Create a path dictionary to keep track of the path from each node to its parent node. Set the path for Wim as None.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_node\".\n   - If the current_node is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current_node that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Set the path of the neighbor as the current_node.\n6. If the loop is broken before finding Amir, it means there is no path from Wim to Amir.\n\nNow let's execute these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Add Wim to the visited set.\n4. Set the path of Wim as None.\n5. Begin the loop:\n   - Dequeue Wim.\n   - Check if Wim is Amir. It is not.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (Wim's neighbors).\n   - Add Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva to the visited set.\n   - Set the path of Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva as Wim.\n   - Dequeue Raj.\n   - Check if Raj is Amir. It is not.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei (Raj's neighbors).\n   - Add Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei to the visited set.\n   - Set the path of Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei as Raj.\n   - Dequeue Jing.\n   - Check if Jing is Amir. It is not.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam (Jing's neighbors).\n   - Add Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam to the visited set.\n   - Set the path of Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam as Jing.\n   - Dequeue Eva.\n   - Check if Eva is Amir. It is not.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, Raj, and Jing (Eva's neighbors).\n   - Add Amir, Wim, Raj, and Jing to the visited set.\n   - Set the path of Amir, Wim, Raj, and Jing as Eva.\n   - Dequeue Amir.\n   - Check if Amir is Amir. It is.\n   - Break the loop.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Amir is: Wim, Raj, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Amir"
