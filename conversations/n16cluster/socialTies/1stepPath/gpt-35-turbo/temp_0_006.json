Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Jing, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If the search completes without finding Jing, there is no path from Wim to Jing.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Jing:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Jing"
