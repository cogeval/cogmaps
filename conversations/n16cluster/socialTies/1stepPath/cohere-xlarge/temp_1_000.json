Coding Round - This is a one-on-one coding round with the recruiter where the candidate is expected to be proficient in data structures and algorithms. The basic level PH test (for phones) is used as a filter prior to the interview rounds.\n\n2. Design round - This part is specific to back-end or front-end candidates.
