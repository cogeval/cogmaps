To find the shortest path from Amir to Wim, we can use a technique called breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is a way of traversing a graph where we explore all the nodes at a given depth before moving on to the next depth.\nIn this case, we start at Amir (node 1) and explore all the nodes that are connected to him (nodes 2-8). We mark these nodes as \"visited\" so we don't explore them again. Then we move on to the next depth and explore all the nodes that are connected to the nodes we previously visited (nodes 9-16). We continue this process until we reach Wim (node 8), which is the shortest path from Amir.\nThe regular expression 'Answer: (Amir, Wim)*' indicates that the shortest path from Amir to Wim is a sequence of Amir and Wim, repeated any number of times. This is because we can get from Amir to Wim by following a sequence of edges that all connect nodes that are connected to Amir and Wim.\nFor example, one possible path from Amir to Wim is: Amir, Wim, Amir, Wim, Amir, Wim. This path visits each node exactly once, so it is the shortest path. Does that help clarify things?"
