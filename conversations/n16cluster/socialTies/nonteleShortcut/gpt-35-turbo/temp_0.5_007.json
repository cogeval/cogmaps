Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Add Amir to the queue and the visited set.\n3. Create a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from each person to Amir.\n4. Create a dictionary to keep track of the number of books each person has.\n5. Create a variable to keep track of the person with the maximum number of books.\n6. Create a variable to keep track of the shortest path length.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a person from the queue.\n   - If the person has more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the shortest path length.\n   - If the person is not Amir, add the person to the shortest path dictionary with the shortest path from Amir.\n   - If the person has more books than Amir, break the loop.\n   - For each connected person to the current person:\n     - If the connected person is not in the visited set:\n       - Add the connected person to the queue and the visited set.\n       - Update the shortest path dictionary with the shortest path from Amir to the connected person.\n       - Update the number of books dictionary with the number of books the connected person has.\n8.
