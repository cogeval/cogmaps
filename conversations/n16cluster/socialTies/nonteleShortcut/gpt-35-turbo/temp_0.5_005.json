Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize variables to keep track of the shortest path and the maximum number of books.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books. If so, update the maximum number of books and the shortest path.\n   - Enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and mark them as visited.\n5. Return the shortest path.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari"
