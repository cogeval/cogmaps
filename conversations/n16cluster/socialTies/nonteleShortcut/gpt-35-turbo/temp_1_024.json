Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Dequeue the first person from the queue.\n   \n   b. Check if the dequeued person has the maximum number of books. If yes, return the list of scholars visited so far.\n   \n   c.
