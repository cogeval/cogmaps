Start by adding Amir to the queue and setting the shortest path from Amir to Amir as [Amir].\n4. While the queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n    - Check if the scholar has more books than the maximum number of books encountered so far.\n    - If yes, update the maximum number of books and store the current shortest path as the answer.\n    - Add the unvisited neighbors of the current scholar to the queue, updating their shortest path with the current scholar's path.\n5.
