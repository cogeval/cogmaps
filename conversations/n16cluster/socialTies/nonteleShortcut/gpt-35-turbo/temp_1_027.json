Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Create a queue to store the scholars and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n3. Initialize variables max_books and max_books_person to keep track of the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n\n4. Start a while loop while the queue is not empty.\n\n5. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n\n6. Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current max_books. If so, update max_books and max_books_person.\n\n7. Check the connections of the current scholar. If a connected scholar is not visited, enqueue them into the queue and mark them as visited.\n\n8.
