Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and visit each connected scholar one by one, keeping track of the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to visit and a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize variables max_books and max_books_scholar to keep track of the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books, respectively.\n4. Start a loop to visit each scholar in the queue until the queue is empty.\n5. Inside the loop, remove the first scholar from the queue and check if they have more books than the current maximum (if applicable).\n6. If they do, update max_books and max_books_scholar accordingly.\n7. Otherwise, add all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar to the queue and mark them as visited.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue is empty.\n9. The scholar with the maximum number of books will be the value of max_books_scholar.\n10. To obtain the shortest path, we can use a separate function that backtracks from max_books_scholar to Amir, following the visited set. This function will return the shortest path as a list of scholar names.\n11. Finally, we can concatenate the scholar names with commas to match the required format.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Matt"
