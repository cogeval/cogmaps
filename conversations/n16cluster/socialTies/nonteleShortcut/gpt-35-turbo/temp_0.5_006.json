Wim\n2. Raj\n3. Jing\n4. Reza\n\nNow, we need to calculate the distance from each of these scholars to their connected scholars:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Distance from Wim to Amir: 1 (direct connection)\n   - Distance from Wim to Raj: 2 (Wim -> Amir -> Raj)\n   - Distance from Wim to Jing: 2 (Wim -> Amir -> Jing)\n   - Distance from Wim to Eva: 3 (Wim -> Amir -> Raj -> Eva)\n\n2.
