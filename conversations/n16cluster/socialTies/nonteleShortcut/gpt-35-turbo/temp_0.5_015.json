Start with Amir.\n2. Explore the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Explore the connections of Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Explore the connections of Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Explore the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Explore the connections of Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n7.

From step 14, we know that Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Therefore, Amy is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha as well.\n\nContinuing from step 17, we can explore the connections of Amy: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections starting from Amir, considering both the original connections and Amy's connections.
