If yes, store the scholar's name.\n- Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n- Mark the current scholar as visited.\n\nStep 3: Return the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
