Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each person has donated.\n\n1. Set the initial state: \n- Create an empty queue and add Amir to the queue.\n- Create an empty set to store visited scholars.\n- Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n- Set the maximum_books variable to 0.\n- Set the maximum_books_scholar variable to None.\n\n2. Perform the breadth-first search:\n- While the queue is not empty:\n  - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and mark them as visited.\n  - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum_books:\n    - If yes, update the maximum_books to the number of books donated by the scholar.\n    - Update the maximum_books_scholar to the current scholar.\n  - Explore the connections of the current scholar:\n    - If a connected scholar has not been visited, enqueue them and update the number of books they have donated based on the previous scholar's donation.\n    - If a connected scholar has been visited, continue to the next connected scholar.\n\n3. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n- Starting from Amir, traverse the connections of each scholar until reaching the maximum_books_scholar.\n- Store the scholar names in order, separated by commas.\n\nApplying these steps, we will find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books."
