Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize a variable \"max_books\" to 0 and a variable \"max_books_person\" to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum. If yes, update \"max_books\" and \"max_books_person\" accordingly.\n   c. Check all the connections of the current scholar that have not been visited yet.\n   d. Enqueue each unvisited connected scholar into the queue and add them to the visited set.\n5.
