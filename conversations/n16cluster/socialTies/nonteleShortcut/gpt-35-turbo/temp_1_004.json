Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has the maximum number of books, stop and output the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited connections of the scholar to the queue, and mark them as visited.\n   - Keep track of the path by appending each scholar to a list.\n4. If no scholar with the maximum number of books is found, output that there is no path.\n\nNow let's implement this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Matt"
