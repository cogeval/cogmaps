Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create a graph with all the scholars and their connections as nodes and edges, respectively.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge, representing the distance between scholars.\n3. Set the initial distance from Amir to himself as 0, and all other distances as infinity.\n4. Create an empty set of visited scholars.\n5. Create an empty queue for scholars to be visited.\n6. Add Amir to the queue.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the scholar with the minimum distance from the queue (let's call this scholar \"current\").\n   b. Add \"current\" to the visited set.\n   c. For each neighbor of \"current\" that has not been visited:\n      - Calculate the distance from Amir to this neighbor through \"current\".\n      - If this distance is shorter than the current distance assigned to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance.\n      - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n8.
