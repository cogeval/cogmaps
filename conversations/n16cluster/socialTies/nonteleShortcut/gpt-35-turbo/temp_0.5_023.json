Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Create a variable to keep track of the person with the maximum number of books.\n5. Create a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books.
