Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited.\n   - If the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - Update the number of books donated by each connected scholar by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n7. Return the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
