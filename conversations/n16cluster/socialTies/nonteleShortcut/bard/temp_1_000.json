Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I created a graph with the scholars as nodes and the connections between them as edges.\n2. I labeled each node with the number of books that the scholar has.\n3. I found the shortest path from Amir to the node with the maximum number of books using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\n```\nAmir, Kim, Moin (50 books)\n```\n\nThis is the shortest path because it is the only path that connects Amir to Moin. The other paths are longer because they involve going through other scholars who do not have as many books.\n\nHere is the regular expression that you requested:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words. The last word in the list must not be followed by a comma.\n\nHere is the output of the regular expression applied to the path above:\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Moin\n```\n\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions."
