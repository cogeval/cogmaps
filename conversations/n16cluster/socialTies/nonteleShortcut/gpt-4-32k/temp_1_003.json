Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We were told that Moin is donating 50 books, and Matt is donating 10 books, so Moin is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\n1. First, we see who Amir is connected to, which is Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\n2. Among these, we check if anyone is connected to Moin, but none of them are.\n\n3. Therefore, we go a step further. Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, but Matt is not our target since Moin has more books.\n\n4. Raj is connected to Wei, but Wei is not connected to Moin.\n\n5. Jing is connected to Pam, but Pam is also not connected to Moin.\n\n6. Finally, we check Reza who is connected to Amir, and Reza is also connected to Kim and Nisha.\n\n7. From there, Kim is connected to Moin. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

Now, we know that Amir is married to Amy and Amy is connected to all the scholars who are connected with Sara.\n\n3. From the information provided earlier, Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\n4. Since Amy is connected to all scholars connected with Sara, she is also connected to Moin. \n\n5. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin (the person with the maximum number of books) is now through Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Amy, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin"
