Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva. (No connection to Moin or someone who is connected to Moin)\n2. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. (No connection to Moin or someone who is connected to Moin)\n3. Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam. (No connection to Moin or someone who is connected to Moin)\n4. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei. Kim is directly connected to Moin, making Reza a suitable path.\n\nSo, from Amir to Moin, the shortest path is through Reza to Kim and then to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

From the information given, we know that Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\nBecause Amy is connected to Moin via Sara's connections, the shortest path from Amir (who is now connected to Amy as they are married) to Moin is through Amy.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin"
