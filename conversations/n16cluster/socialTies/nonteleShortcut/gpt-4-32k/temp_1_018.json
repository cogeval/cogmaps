Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So, we'll have to move through the connections to find the shortest path. \n\nStarting from Wim, the shortest connection to Moin is 3 steps: Wim to Eva to Matt to Ian to Moin.\n\nStarting from Raj, the shortest connection to Moin is also 3 steps: Raj to Wei to Kim to Moin.\n\nStarting from Jing, the shortest connection to Moin is 4 steps: Jing to Pam to Pari to Puja to Moin.\n\nStarting from Reza, the shortest connection to Moin is 2 steps: Reza to Kim to Moin.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
