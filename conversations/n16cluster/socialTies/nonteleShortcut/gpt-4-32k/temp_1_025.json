Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So we are looking for the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nStep 1: Start from Amir. According to the connections, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Moin is not in this group, so we need to explore further.\n\nStep 2: None of Amir's direct connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) have a direct connection to Moin. However, Kim is directly connected to Moin and is reachable from Reza, who is connected to Amir.\n\nStep 3: We have found the shortest path: Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."

Now, we need to find the shortest path to Moin considering the new connection - Amy.\n\nStep 1: Start from Amir. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, and now Amy.\n\nStep 2: We know that Amy is connected to all the scholars who are connected with Sara. Looking at Sara's connections, she is linked to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\nStep 3: Since Amy is connected to Moin (through Sara), the shortest path from Amir to Moin now includes Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: Amir -> Amy -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin."
