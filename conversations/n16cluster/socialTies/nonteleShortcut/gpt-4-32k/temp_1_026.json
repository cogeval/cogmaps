Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

It is clear from the task that Moin has 50 books and Matt has 10. So, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\n2. We need to figure out the shortest path from Amir to Moin. The given connections form a kind of network and I will follow this network to reach Moin starting from Amir.\n\n3. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   \n4. Among these scholars, Wim and Jing are connected to scholars who are connected to Moin. Wim is connected to Eva, and Jing is connected to Pam, both of whom are connected to Matt. However, Matt is then connected to Moin. \n\n5. So, the shortest path can be Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Moin or Amir -> Jing -> Pam -> Matt -> Moin. Both paths consist of 4 connections.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Moin"

Remembering from the previous information that Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\n4. Now the shortest path to Moin might have changed since Amy is connected to Moin through Sara.\n\n5.
