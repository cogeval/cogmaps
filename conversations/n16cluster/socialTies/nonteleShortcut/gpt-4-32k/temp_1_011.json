Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Then, I'll have to chart a path from Amir to Moin considering the connections provided.\n\nStarting from Amir, the connections go as follows:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars are Moin, so I will explore their connections.\n\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva, but not Moin.\n   \n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei, but not Moin.\n   \n4. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam, but not Moin.\n   \n5. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Through Kim, we can reach Moin.\n   \n6. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Here, we finally have a direct connection to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir - Reza - Kim - Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
