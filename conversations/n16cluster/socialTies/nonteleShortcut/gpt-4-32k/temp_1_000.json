Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This includes Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 3: Identify if any of Amir's connections directly connects with Moin. Unfortunately, none of them do.\n\nStep 4: Identify the next layer of connections through Amir's connections and find a path to Moin.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the connections, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian -> Moin.\n\nFinal step: Return the scholar names in order, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin"

Hence Amy is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\nStep 3: From the above step, it can be seen that Amy is directly connected to Moin who has the maximum books. \n\nStep 4: This makes the path shorter now as Amy is connected to Moin directly. So the path from Amir to Moin, through Amy is: Amir -> Amy -> Moin.\n\nFinal Step: Return the scholar names in order, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin"
