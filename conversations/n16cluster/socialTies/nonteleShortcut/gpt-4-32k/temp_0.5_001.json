Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

However, Ian and Puja are indirectly connected to Amir through their connections with other scholars.\n\nAmir can reach Ian through Wim and Eva, and he can reach Puja through Jing and Pam. \n\nComparing these paths, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Wim, Eva, and Ian. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Ian, Moin"
