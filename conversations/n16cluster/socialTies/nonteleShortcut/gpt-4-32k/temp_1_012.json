Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here is the process:\n\n- Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n- According to the information, Moin has the most books. So, we need to find a route to Moin.\n- Amir is not directly connected to Moin, so we need to find someone connected to both Amir and Moin. Based on the connections, we see that Raj is connected to Amir. \n- Raj is also connected to Wei. \n- Wei is directly connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) goes through Raj and Wei. \n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order are Amir, Raj, Wei, and Moin."
