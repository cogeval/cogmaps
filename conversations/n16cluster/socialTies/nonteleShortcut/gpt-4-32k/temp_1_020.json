Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Now, trace the connections to find the shortest path to Moin.\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. These scholars have further connections. As the shortest path is asked, check each connection.\n\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. But none of these connects to Moin directly.\n\nRaj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Again, none of these connects to Moin directly.\n\nJing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None connects to Moin directly.\n\nReza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Only Kim connects directly to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path to Moin from Amir is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
