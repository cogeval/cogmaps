No direct connection to Amir.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. No direct connection to Amir.\n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. No direct connection to Amir.\n- Wim is directly connected to Amir, along with Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Eva to Amir is Eva -> Wim -> Amir.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Wim, Amir"
