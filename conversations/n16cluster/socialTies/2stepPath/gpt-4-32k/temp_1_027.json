Since Jing is not directly connected to Eva, we will have to explore the connections of Eva's connections (i.e., step two).\n\n   a. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva. Here, we find Jing connected with Wim. \n\nFrom the exploration, the shortest path from Eva to Jing is through Wim. Thus, Eva \u2192 Wim \u2192 Jing is the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Wim, Jing"
