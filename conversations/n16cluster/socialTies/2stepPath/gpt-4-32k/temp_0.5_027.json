No direct connection to Jing.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Pam is directly connected to Jing.\n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. No direct connection to Jing.\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n\nThird, I will compare the two paths: Eva-Pam-Jing and Eva-Wim-Jing. Both paths are of the same length.\n\nSo, Eva can reach Jing through either Pam or Wim. The paths are Eva, Pam, Jing or Eva, Wim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pam, Jing, Eva, Wim, Jing"
