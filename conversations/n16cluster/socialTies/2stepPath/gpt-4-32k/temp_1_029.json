Let's see the possible paths:\n\n- Eva to Pari, then Pari to Puja, and Puja to Ian: So, the path is Eva-Pari-Puja-Ian.\n- Eva to Pam, but Pam is not directly connected to either Pari, Puja, or Ian, so this path is discarded.\n- Eva to Matt, and Matt directly to Ian: So, the path is Eva-Matt-Ian.\n- Eva to Wim, but Wim is not directly connected to either Pari, Puja, or Ian, so this path is discarded.\n\nBetween the two remaining options, Eva-Matt-Ian is the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Matt, Ian."
