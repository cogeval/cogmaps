If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Raj.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, followed by the connection to Raj.\n5. If not, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n   - For Pari, check her connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - For Pam, check her connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - For Matt, check his connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - For Wim, check his connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. Repeat step 4 for each connection until Raj is found.\n7. If Raj is not found, there is no path from Eva to Raj.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Raj.\n3. Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Pari is not connected to Raj.\n5. Pam is not connected to Raj.\n6. Matt is connected to Ian, but Ian is not connected to Raj.\n7. Wim is connected to Raj. \n\nAnswer: Eva, Wim, Raj"
