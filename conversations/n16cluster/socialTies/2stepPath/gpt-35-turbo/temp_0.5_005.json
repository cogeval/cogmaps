Start with Wim as the current scholar and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue to store the scholars to visit.\n3. Enqueue Wim into the queue.\n4. Create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n5. Create a dictionary to keep track of the previous scholar for each visited scholar.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current scholar.\n   b. If the current scholar is Reza, we have found the shortest path. Break the loop.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited yet, do the following steps:\n      - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n      - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n      - Set the previous scholar of the connected scholar as the current scholar in the dictionary.\n7. If Reza is not found, there is no path from Wim to Reza.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Reza:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Reza"
