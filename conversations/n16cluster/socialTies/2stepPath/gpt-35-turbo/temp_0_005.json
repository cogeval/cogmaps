Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Reza, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If Reza is not found, there is no path from Wim to Reza.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Reza:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Mark Wim as visited.\n4. Set the path dictionary for Wim as empty.\n5. Dequeue Wim.\n6. Wim has the following neighbors: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Enqueue Amir and set Wim as its parent in the path dictionary.\n   - Enqueue Raj and set Wim as its parent in the path dictionary.\n   - Enqueue Jing and set Wim as its parent in the path dictionary.\n   - Enqueue Eva and set Wim as its parent in the path dictionary.\n7. Dequeue Amir.\n8. Amir has the following neighbors: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Reza is found! Stop the search.\n9. Backtrack the path from Reza to Wim using the path dictionary:\n   - Reza's parent is Amir.\n   - Amir's parent is Wim.\n10. The shortest path from Wim to Reza is: Wim, Amir, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Reza"
