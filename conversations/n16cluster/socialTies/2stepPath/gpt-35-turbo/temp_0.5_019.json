Check the connections of Jing: Amir (1), Wim (2), Raj (3), and Pam (14).\n3. Since Matt is not directly connected to Jing, we need to explore further.\n4. From the connections of Jing, we prioritize the scholars who are not yet visited in the following order: Amir (1), Wim (2), Raj (3), and Pam (14).\n5. Move to Amir (1) and check his connections: Wim (2), Raj (3), Jing (4), and Reza (7).\n6. Since Matt is not directly connected to Amir, we continue exploring.\n7. From the connections of Amir, we prioritize the scholars who are not yet visited in the following order: Wim (2), Raj (3), Jing (4), and Reza (7).\n8. Move to Wim (2) and check his connections: Amir (1), Raj (3), Jing (4), and Eva (16).\n9. Since Matt is not directly connected to Wim, we continue exploring.\n10.
