Create a queue to store the scholars to be explored and a list to keep track of visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Wim into the queue and mark Wim as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and Pari has not been found, there is no path from Wim to Pari.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and a list of visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Wim and mark Wim as visited. The queue contains [Wim].\n3. Dequeue Wim from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (connected to Wim) into the queue and mark them as visited. The queue contains [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva].\n4. Dequeue Amir from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Reza (connected to Amir) into the queue and mark it as visited. The queue contains [Raj, Jing, Eva, Reza].\n5. Dequeue Raj from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Jing and Wei (connected to Raj) into the queue and mark them as visited. The queue contains [Jing, Eva, Reza, Jing, Wei].\n6. Dequeue Jing from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, and Pam (connected to Jing) into the queue. The queue contains [Eva, Reza, Jing, Wei, Amir, Wim, Pam].\n7. Dequeue Eva from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Pari (connected to Eva) into the queue. The queue contains [Reza, Jing, Wei, Amir, Wim, Pam, Pari].\n8. Dequeue Reza from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Nisha and Kim (connected to Reza) into the queue. The queue contains [Jing, Wei, Amir, Wim, Pam, Pari, Nisha, Kim].\n9. Dequeue Jing from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n   - Enqueue Moin (connected to Jing) into the queue. The queue contains [Wei, Amir, Wim, Pam, Pari, Nisha, Kim, Moin].\n10. Dequeue Wei from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n    - Enqueue Nisha, Reza, and Kim (connected to Wei) into the queue. The queue contains [Amir, Wim, Pam, Pari, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Nisha, Reza, Kim].\n11. Dequeue Amir from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n    - Enqueue Moin and Sara (connected to Amir) into the queue. The queue contains [Wim, Pam, Pari, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Sara].\n12. Dequeue Wim from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n    - Enqueue Ian (connected to Wim) into the queue. The queue contains [Pam, Pari, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Sara, Ian].\n13. Dequeue Pam from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is not, so continue.\n    - Enqueue Matt and Eva (connected to Pam) into the queue. The queue contains [Pari, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Sara, Ian, Matt, Eva].\n14. Dequeue Pari from the queue and check if it is Pari. It is!
