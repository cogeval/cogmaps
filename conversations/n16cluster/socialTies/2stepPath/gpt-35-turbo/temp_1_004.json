Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\n3. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current scholar.\n\n4. Check if the current scholar is Kim. If it is, the shortest path has been found. Return the path from Amir to Kim.\n\n5. If the current scholar is not Kim, check their connections. Enqueue any unvisited connected scholars and mark them as visited.\n\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Add Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to the queue.\n     Queue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\n     Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza}\n\n   - Continue this process until Kim is found.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Kim:\n\n1.
