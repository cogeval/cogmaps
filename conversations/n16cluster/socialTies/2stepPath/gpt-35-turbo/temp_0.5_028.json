Check if Eva is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Puja. If not, continue to the next step.\n3. Check Eva's connections: Pam, Matt, and Wim. Add them to the queue.\n4. Take the first person from the queue (Pam) and check if Pam is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pam, Puja. If not, continue to the next step.\n5. Check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Add them to the queue.\n6. Continue this process until Puja is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Puja.\n3. Add Pam, Matt, and Wim to the queue: Pam, Matt, Wim.\n4. Take the first person from the queue (Pam).\n5. Pam is not directly connected to Puja.\n6. Add Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva to the queue: Matt, Wim, Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n7. Take the first person from the queue (Matt).\n8. Matt is not directly connected to Puja.\n9.
