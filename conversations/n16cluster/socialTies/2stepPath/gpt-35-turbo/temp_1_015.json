Starting from Jing, we need to maintain a queue of scholars to visit and a visited set to keep track of scholars we have already explored.\n2. Add Jing to the queue and mark Jing as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Reza, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that hasn't been visited yet, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n4. If we finish the search without finding Reza, there is no path from Jing to Reza.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Jing. Add Jing to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   Queue: Jing\n   Visited: Jing\n2. Dequeue Jing. Check its connections.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Amir, Wim, and Raj haven't been visited yet. Add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n   Queue: Amir, Wim, Raj\n   Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj\n3. Dequeue Amir. Check its connections.\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, and Reza. Wim and Raj have already been visited, but Reza hasn't. Add Reza to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   Queue: Wim, Raj, Reza\n   Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Reza\n4. Dequeue Wim. Check its connections.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Amir, Raj, and Jing have already been visited, but Eva hasn't. Add Eva to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   Queue: Raj, Reza, Eva\n   Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Reza, Eva\n5. Dequeue Raj. Check its connections.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Amir, Wim, and Jing have already been visited, but Wei hasn't. Add Wei to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   Queue: Reza, Eva, Wei\n   Visited: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Reza, Eva, Wei\n6. Dequeue Reza. We have found the shortest path from Jing to Reza.\n\nThe shortest path from Jing to Reza is: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Reza"
