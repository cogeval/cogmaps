If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar who is connected to Eva. Repeat this process until you find a connection to Eva.\n5. Continue this process until you find a connection to Eva or you have checked all possible connections.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start at Jing.\n2. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of them is connected to Eva.\n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of them is connected to Eva.\n4. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Eva is connected to Wim. The shortest path is Jing, Wim, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wim, Eva"
