Create a queue and enqueue Reza.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Moin, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Add the connected scholar as the value and the dequeued scholar as the key in the path dictionary.\n6. If the algorithm finishes without finding Moin, there is no path from Reza to Moin.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\nAnswer: Reza, Kim, Moin"
