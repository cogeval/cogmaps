Check if Wim is connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Matt.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n4. Add Wim's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if Amir is connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Amir, and Matt.\n6. If not, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Matt is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at Wim.\n2. Wim is not connected to Matt.\n3. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Queue: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n5. Take Amir from the queue.\n6. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n7. Queue: Raj, Jing, Eva, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n8. Take Raj from the queue.\n9. Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n10. Queue: Jing, Eva, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n11. Take Jing from the queue.\n12. Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n13. Queue: Eva, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n14. Take Eva from the queue.\n15. Eva's connections: Wim, Pam, Matt, and Ian.\n16. Queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam, Wim, Pam, Matt, Ian.\n17. Take Wim from the queue.\n18. Wim is already visited, skip.\n19. Take Raj from the queue.\n20. Raj is already visited, skip.\n21. Take Jing from the queue.\n22. Jing is already visited, skip.\n23. Take Reza from the queue.\n24.
