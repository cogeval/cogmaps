Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Skip Amir, Wim, and Raj since we have already visited them. Check Pam.\n5. Check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Skip Jing since we have already visited her. Check Pari.\n6. Check Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Skip Pam and Matt since we have already visited them. Check Eva.\n7. Check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Skip Pari, Pam, and Matt since we have already visited them. Check Wim.\n8. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Skip Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva since we have already visited them. No new connections.\n9. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.
