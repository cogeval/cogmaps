If yes, the shortest path is just Reza and Wim.\n3. If not, check Reza's connections (Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei).\n4. Add Reza's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if they are connected to Wim. If yes, the shortest path is Reza, Amir, and Wim.\n6. If not, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Eva) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each scholar in the queue until Wim is found or the queue is empty.\n\nApplying this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Reza to Wim:\n\n1. Reza\n2. Amir\n3.
