Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. We will explore these connections next.\n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. We skip Reza as it has already been visited. We add Wim, Raj, and Jing to the queue.\n4. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. We skip Reza as it has already been visited. We add Wei, Nisha, and Moin to the queue.\n5. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. We skip Reza as it has already been visited. We add Wei, Kim, and Sara to the queue.\n6. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. We skip Reza as it has already been visited. We add Nisha and Raj to the queue.\n7. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. We have found the shortest path to Moin.\n8.
