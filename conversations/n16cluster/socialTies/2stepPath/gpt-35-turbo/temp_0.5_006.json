If yes, then the shortest path is just Wim and Wei.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n4. Add Wim's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if they are connected to Wei. If yes, then the shortest path is Wim, Amir, and Wei.\n6. If not, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Wei is found or the queue becomes empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Wim is not connected to Wei.\n3. Wim's connections are Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Queue: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n6. Amir is not connected to Wei.\n7. Amir's connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n8. Queue: Raj, Jing, Eva, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n9. Take the first scholar from the queue (Raj).\n10. Raj is connected to Wei. Answer: Wim, Raj, Wei.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Wei is Wim, Raj, Wei."
