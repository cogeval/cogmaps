If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Eva.\n3. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the intermediate scholar, and Eva.\n4. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Eva. Repeat this step until a connection is found.\n5. Continue this process until Eva is reached.\n\nNow let's go through the connections step by step:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Eva is directly connected to Wim, so the shortest path from Jing to Eva is Jing, Wim, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wim, Eva"
