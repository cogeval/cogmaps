Create a visited set and add Amir to it.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the path from each scholar to its previous scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and call it current_scholar.\n   - If current_scholar is Eva, stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to current_scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Set the connected scholar's previous scholar in the path dictionary to be the current_scholar.\n5. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from Amir to Eva.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Eva:\n\n1. Enqueue Amir and add him to the visited set: Queue = [Amir], Visited = {Amir}.\n2. Dequeue Amir and set him as the current_scholar.\n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Enqueue them and add them to the visited set: Queue = [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza], Visited = {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza}.\n4. Dequeue Wim and set him as the current_scholar.\n5. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Since Eva is the target scholar, stop the search.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Eva is: Amir, Wim, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva"
