Start with Raj as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Nisha. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n   - Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n4. If we have not found the shortest path after visiting all the scholars, it means there is no path from Raj to Nisha.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start with Raj as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Dequeue Raj.\n4. Enqueue Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Dequeue Amir.\n6. Enqueue Reza.\n7. Dequeue Wim.\n8. Enqueue Eva.\n9. Dequeue Jing.\n10. Enqueue Pam.\n11. Dequeue Wei.\n12. Enqueue Nisha.\n13. Dequeue Reza.\n14. Enqueue Kim.\n15. Dequeue Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Nisha"
