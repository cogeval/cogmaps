If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Amir.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add these connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue (Pari).\n6. Check if Pari is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pari, and Amir.\n7. If not, add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, and Eva) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Amir is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Eva to Amir is:\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Ian, Moin, Kim, Reza, Amir"
