Start with Wim as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty list to store the path.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the previous node for each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pam, stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue the scholar.\n     - Set the previous node for the scholar as the current scholar.\n6. If Pam is found, backtrack from Pam to Wim using the previous node dictionary to construct the path.\n7. Reverse the path to get the shortest path from Wim to Pam.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Eva, Pari, Pam"
