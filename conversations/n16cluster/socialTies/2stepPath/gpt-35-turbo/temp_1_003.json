Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Nisha, the search is complete. Return the path from Amir to Nisha.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited.\n   - For each connected scholar, enqueue them into the queue, add them to the visited set, and update their path with the path from the dequeued scholar.\n4. If the search completes without finding Nisha, there is no path from Amir to Nisha.\n\nLet's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to Nisha:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Nisha"
