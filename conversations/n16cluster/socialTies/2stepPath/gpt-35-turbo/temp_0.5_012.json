If yes, the path is Raj, Pam.\n3. If not, check Raj's connections (Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei).\n4. Add Raj's connections to a queue in the order they are mentioned (Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei).\n5. Remove Raj from the queue.\n6. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if they are connected to Pam. If yes, the path is Raj, Amir, Pam.\n7. If not, check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n8. Add Amir's connections to the end of the queue (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n9. Remove Amir from the queue.\n10. Repeat steps 6-9 until Pam is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Raj to Pam.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Pam"
