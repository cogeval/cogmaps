Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from Raj.\n2. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n3. Check if any of the connections (Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei) are Reza. None of them is Reza.\n4. Next, explore the connections of the connections of Raj.\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Skip Amir as we have already visited this scholar.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Skip Wim as we have already visited this scholar.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Skip Jing as we have already visited this scholar.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Check if Wei is Reza. Wei is not Reza.\n5. Continue exploring the connections of the connections of Raj.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Check if Nisha is Reza. Nisha is not Reza.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Reza is found!\n6. The shortest path from Raj to Reza is Raj, Wei, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Reza"
