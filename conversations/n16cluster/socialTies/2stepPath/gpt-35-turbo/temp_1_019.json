Check the connections of Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Since Matt is not connected to Wim, we move on.\n5. Check the connections of Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Since Matt is not connected to Raj, we move on.\n6. Check the connections of Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. We have found Matt in the connections of Pam.\n7.
