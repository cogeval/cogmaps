Create an empty queue and an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Wim into the queue.\n3. Add Wim to the visited set.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Wim to it.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Pam, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Create a new path list by copying the current path list and adding the connected scholar to the end.\n6. If the queue becomes empty and Pam is not found, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow, let's perform the steps and find the shortest path from Wim to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Pam"
