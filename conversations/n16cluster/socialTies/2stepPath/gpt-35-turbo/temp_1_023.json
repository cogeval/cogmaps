Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n3. None of Reza's immediate connections are Sara, so we expand the search to the next level.\n4. Check the connections of Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Amir's connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Sara is not among them.\n   - Kim's connections are Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Sara is not among them.\n   - Nisha's connections are Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. We found Sara!\n5. The shortest path from Reza to Sara is Reza (5), Nisha (11), and Sara (12).\n\nAnswer: Reza, Nisha, Sara"
