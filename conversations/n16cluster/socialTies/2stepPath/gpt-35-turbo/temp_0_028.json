Check if Eva is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Puja.\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Puja, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are directly connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, the direct connection, and Puja.\n5. If none of Eva's connections are directly connected to Puja, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Puja is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Puja.\n3. Eva's connections are Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. None of Eva's connections are directly connected to Puja.\n5. Check the connections of Eva's connections:\n   - Pari is connected to Puja.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. Puja is directly connected to Pari, so the shortest path from Eva to Puja is: Eva, Pam, Pari, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pam, Pari, Puja"
