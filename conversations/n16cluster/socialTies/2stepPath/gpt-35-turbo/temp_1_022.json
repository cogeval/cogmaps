Start with Reza as the starting point.\n2. Create an empty queue to store the scholars we will visit.\n3. Mark Reza as visited and enqueue Reza.\n4. Initialize an empty list to store the path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   2. Check if the dequeued scholar is Jing. If yes, stop the search.\n   3. Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar, mark them as visited, and update their parent to the dequeued scholar.\n6. If Jing is found, backtrack from Jing to Reza using the parent information and add the scholar numbers to the path list.\n7. Reverse the path list to get the shortest path from Reza to Jing.\n8. Finally, list the scholar numbers in order, including Reza, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir, Jing"
