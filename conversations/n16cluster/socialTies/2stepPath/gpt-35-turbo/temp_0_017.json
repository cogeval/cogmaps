If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Wei.\n3. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the directly connected scholar, and Wei.\n4. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Wei. Repeat this step until a connection is found.\n5. Continue this process until a connection is found or all possible paths have been explored.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Wei.\n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, and Reza.\n4. Wim is connected to Wei.\n5. Therefore, the shortest path from Jing to Wei is: Jing, Amir, Wim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Wei"
