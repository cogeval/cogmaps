Check if Eva is connected directly to Raj. If yes, then the shortest path is just Eva and Raj. Answer: Eva, Raj.\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Raj, we need to explore the connections of Eva's immediate connections (Wim, Pam, Matt) and continue the search.\n4. Check if any of Eva's immediate connections are connected directly to Raj. If yes, then the shortest path includes Eva, that immediate connection, and Raj. Answer: Eva, <immediate connection>, Raj.\n5. If none of Eva's immediate connections are directly connected to Raj, we need to continue the search by exploring the connections of Eva's immediate connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until we find a direct connection to Raj or we have exhausted all possible connections.\n\nApplying the steps above:\n\n1. Eva is not directly connected to Raj.\n2. Eva's immediate connections are Wim, Pam, Matt.\n3. Wim is not directly connected to Raj.\n4. Pam is connected directly to Raj. Answer: Eva, Pam, Raj.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Eva to Raj is Eva, Pam, Raj."
