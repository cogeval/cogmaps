Check if Eva is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is [Eva, Puja].\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Puja, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add Eva's connections to a queue and mark Eva as visited.\n5. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n    - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    - Check if the dequeued scholar is Puja. If yes, stop the loop and create a path from Eva to Puja using the visited nodes.\n    - If the dequeued scholar is not Puja, check their connections that have not been visited yet.\n    - Add the unvisited connections to the queue and mark them as visited.\n6. If the loop ends and Puja is not found, there is no path from Eva to Puja.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Eva to Puja:\n\n1. Start at Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Puja, so check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n3. Add Eva's connections to the queue: [Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim].\n4. Mark Eva as visited.\n5. Start the loop:\n    - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue: Pari.\n    - Pari is not Puja, so check Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n    - Add the unvisited connections to the queue: [Pam, Matt, Puja].\n    - Mark Pari as visited.\n    \n    - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue: Pam.\n    - Pam is not Puja, so check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n    - Add the unvisited connections to the queue: [Jing, Matt, Eva].\n    - Mark Pam as visited.\n    \n    - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue: Matt.\n    - Matt is not Puja, so check Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n    - Add the unvisited connections to the queue: [Pari, Ian].\n    - Mark Matt as visited.\n    \n    - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue: Wim.\n    - Wim is not Puja, so check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n    - Add the unvisited connections to the queue: [Amir, Raj, Jing].\n    - Mark Wim as visited.\n    \n    - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue: Puja.\n    - Puja is Puja! Stop the loop and create the path from Eva to Puja: [Eva, Pari, Puja].\n    \n6. The shortest path from Eva to Puja is: Answer: Eva, Pari, Puja."
