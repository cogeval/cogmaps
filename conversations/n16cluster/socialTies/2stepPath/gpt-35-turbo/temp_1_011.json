Raj is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Wim (scholar number 2), Jing (scholar number 4), and Wei (scholar number 9).\n3. Add Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei to the queue.\n4. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Amir (scholar number 1).\n5. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza (scholar number 7).\n6. Check if any of them is Eva. If not, add Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to the queue.\n7. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Wim (scholar number 2).\n8. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (scholar number 16).\n9. Check if any of them is Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Raj, Wim, Eva. Otherwise, add Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva to the queue.\n10. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Jing (scholar number 4).\n11. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam (scholar number 13).\n12. Check if any of them is Eva. If not, add Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam to the queue.\n13. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza (scholar number 7).\n14. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim (scholar number 8), Nisha (scholar number 11), and Wei.\n15. Check if any of them is Eva. If not, add Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei to the queue.\n16. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Eva (scholar number 16).\n17. Eva is the target scholar we are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Raj to Eva is:\nAnswer: Raj, Wim, Eva"
