Mark Raj as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue and call it \"current\".\n   2. If \"current\" is Nisha, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the path.\n   3. Otherwise, add all unvisited scholars connected to \"current\" to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. If we have reached this step, there is no path from Raj to Nisha.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the given network, here is the shortest path from Raj to Nisha:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Nisha"
