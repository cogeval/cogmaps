If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Reza. Answer: Jing, Reza.\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Reza, we need to explore the connections of Jing's connections.\n4. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n5. Check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the connecting scholar, and Reza.\n6. None of the scholars directly connected to Jing are connected to Reza, so we need to explore further.\n7. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Since Reza is one of Amir's connections, the shortest path is Jing, Amir, Reza. Answer: Jing, Amir, Reza.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Jing to Reza is Jing, Amir, Reza."
