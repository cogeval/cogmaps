Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars.\n2. Initialize a queue for BFS and add Eva to it.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize an empty list to keep track of the path from Eva to each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Ian, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - For each scholar connected to the current scholar and not in the visited set:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the path list, which is the path from Eva to the current scholar plus the connected scholar.\n6. If no path is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let me execute these steps to find the shortest path from Eva to Ian.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Ian"
