Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Add Amir to the visited set.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Amir to it.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Wei, return the path list.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar is not in the visited set:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n       - Create a new path list by copying the previous path list and adding the connected scholar to it.\n6. If no path is found, return an empty list.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Wei:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei"
