Start with Raj as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Eva, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n   - Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n   - Add the dequeued scholar to the shortest path list.\n5.
