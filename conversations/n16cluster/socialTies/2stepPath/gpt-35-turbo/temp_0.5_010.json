Starting from Raj, we will explore the connections of each scholar until we reach Reza.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Reza:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Enqueue Raj to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to its previous scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Reza, stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each of the connections of the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following steps:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Add the connection to the path dictionary, with the connected scholar as the key and the dequeued scholar as the value.\n6. If Reza is not found, there is no path from Raj to Reza.\n7. If Reza is found, construct the shortest path by backtracking from Reza to Raj using the path dictionary.\n8. Return the shortest path as a list of scholar numbers, including Raj, separated by commas.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Reza.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir, Reza"
