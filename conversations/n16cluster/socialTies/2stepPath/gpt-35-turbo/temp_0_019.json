If yes, the shortest path is Jing, Matt.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of these scholars are connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the connected scholar, Matt.\n5. If not, check the connections of the scholars connected to Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Matt is found or all connections are exhausted.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Matt.\n3. Check the connections of Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam:\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n4. None of these scholars are directly connected to Matt.\n5. Check the connections of the scholars connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam:\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Eva is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n6. None of these scholars are directly connected to Matt.\n\nBased on the connections, there is no direct path from Jing to Matt. Therefore, there is no shortest path from Jing to Matt.\n\nAnswer: There is no shortest path from Jing to Matt."
