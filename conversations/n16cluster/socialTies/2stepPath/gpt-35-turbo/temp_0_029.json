If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Ian.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add these connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue (Pari).\n6. Check if Pari is connected to Ian. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pari, and Ian.\n7. If not, add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, and Eva) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Ian is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not connected to Ian.\n3. Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Queue: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue: Pari.\n6. Pari is not connected to Ian.\n7. Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, and Eva.\n8. Queue: Pam, Matt, Wim, Pam, Matt, Eva.\n9. Take the first connection from the queue: Pam.\n10. Pam is not connected to Ian.\n11. Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n12. Queue: Matt, Wim, Pam, Matt, Eva, Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n13. Take the first connection from the queue: Matt.\n14.
