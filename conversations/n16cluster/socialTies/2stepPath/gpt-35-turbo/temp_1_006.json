Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Check each connection's connections:\n   - For Amir, check his connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - For Raj, check his connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - For Jing, check his connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - For Eva, check her connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Pari.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each connection until Wei is found.\n5. Once Wei is found, trace back the connections to Wim to determine the shortest path.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Wim to Wei is:\nWim, Raj, Wei\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Wei"
