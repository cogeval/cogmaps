Add Jing to the queue and mark Jing as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue (let's call it current_scholar).\n   b. If current_scholar is Wei, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to current_scholar that is not visited, do the following steps:\n      - Mark the scholar as visited.\n      - Add the scholar to the queue.\n      - Keep track of the path by adding the scholar number to a path list.\n      - Repeat steps a-c until the queue is empty or Wei is found.\n3. If Wei is found, return the path list.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Jing to Wei is:\nJing, Amir, Wim, Wei\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Wei"
