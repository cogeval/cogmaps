Create a queue to keep track of the scholars we will visit next.\n2. Enqueue Jing into the queue.\n3. Create a set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the shortest path from each scholar to Jing.\n5. Create a variable to store the current scholar we are visiting, initialized as Jing.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each of the scholars connected to the current scholar:\n     - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n       - Update the shortest path dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the connected scholar as the value.\n7. If we reach this point, there is no path from Jing to Pari. Return an empty list.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Pari:\n\n1. Enqueue Jing into the queue.\n2. Set Jing as visited.\n3. Initialize the shortest path dictionary with Jing as the key and None as the value.\n4. Start the while loop:\n   - Dequeue the next scholar from the queue, which is Jing.\n   - Since Jing is not Pari, check the scholars connected to Jing:\n     - The scholars connected to Jing are Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n     - Amir has already been visited, so we skip it.\n     - Wim has already been visited, so we skip it.\n     - Raj has already been visited, so we skip it.\n     - Pam has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue Pam into the queue.\n       - Set Pam as visited.\n       - Update the shortest path dictionary with Jing as the key and Pam as the value.\n     - Since we have visited all the connected scholars, the while loop continues with the next scholar in the queue.\n   - Now, the next scholar in the queue is Pam.\n     - Since Pam is not Pari, check the scholars connected to Pam:\n       - The scholars connected to Pam are Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n       - Jing has already been visited, so we skip it.\n       - Pari has not been visited:\n         - Enqueue Pari into the queue.\n         - Set Pari as visited.\n         - Update the shortest path dictionary with Pam as the key and Pari as the value.\n       - Matt has already been visited, so we skip it.\n       - Eva has already been visited, so we skip it.\n       - Since we have visited all the connected scholars, the while loop continues with the next scholar in the queue.\n   - Now, the next scholar in the queue is Pari.\n     - Since Pari is the target scholar, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n\nThe shortest path from Jing to Pari is: Jing, Pam, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Pari"
