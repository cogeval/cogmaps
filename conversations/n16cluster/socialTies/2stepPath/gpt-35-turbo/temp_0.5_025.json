If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Amir.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add these connections to a queue in the order they were mentioned (Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim).\n5. Remove Eva from the queue.\n6. Take the first scholar from the queue (Pari) and check if Pari is connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pari, and Amir.\n7. If not, add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja) to the end of the queue.\n8. Remove Pari from the queue.\n9. Take the next scholar from the queue (Pam) and repeat steps 6-8.\n10. Continue this process until Amir is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Eva to Amir:\n\n1. Start at Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Amir, so we move to step 3.\n3. Eva's connections are Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Let's add them to the queue: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n4. Remove Eva from the queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Pari).\n6. Pari is not directly connected to Amir, so we move to step 7.\n7. Pari's connections are Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Let's add them to the end of the queue: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n8. Remove Pari from the queue.\n9. Take the next scholar from the queue (Pam).\n10. Pam is not directly connected to Amir, so we move to step 7.\n11. Pam's connections are Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Let's add them to the end of the queue: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n12. Remove Pam from the queue.\n13. Take the next scholar from the queue (Matt).\n14. Matt is directly connected to Amir, so the shortest path from Eva to Amir is Eva, Pari, Matt, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Matt, Amir"
