Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n3. Add Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Amir.\n5. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n6. Add Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to the queue if they are not already visited.\n7. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Wim.\n8. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n9. Add Raj, Jing, and Eva to the queue if they are not already visited.\n10. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Raj.\n11. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n12. Add Wei to the queue if it is not already visited.\n13. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Jing.\n14. Jing is already visited, so skip it.\n15. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n16. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n17. Add Kim and Nisha to the queue if they are not already visited.\n18. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Wei.\n19. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n20. Add Nisha and Kim to the queue if they are not already visited.\n21. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Nisha.\n22. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n23. Add Sara to the queue if it is not already visited.\n24. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Kim.\n25. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n26. Add Moin to the queue if it is not already visited.\n27. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Raj.\n28. Raj is already visited, so skip it.\n29. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Moin.\n30. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n31. Add Ian, Puja, and Sara to the queue if they are not already visited.\n32. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Sara.\n33. Check Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n34. Add Puja to the queue if it is not already visited.\n35. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Ian.\n36. Check Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n37. Add Matt to the queue if it is not already visited.\n38. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Puja.\n39. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n40. Add Pari to the queue if it is not already visited.\n41. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Matt.\n42. Check Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n43. Add Pam and Eva to the queue if they are not already visited.\n44. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Eva.\n45. Check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n46. Add Pari to the queue if it is not already visited.\n47. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Pari.\n48. Pari is the destination, so we have found the shortest path from Jing to Pari.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Pari"
