Raj is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Wim (scholar number 2), Jing (scholar number 4), and Wei (scholar number 10). We will mark Raj as visited and enqueue these connections in a queue.\n3. Take the first connection from the queue, which is Amir.\n4. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza, but we don't enqueue Raj because it has already been visited. We mark Amir as visited and enqueue Wim, Jing, and Reza.\n5. Next, we take Wim from the queue.\n6. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva, but we don't enqueue Raj because it has already been visited. We mark Wim as visited and enqueue Amir, Jing, and Eva.\n7. Continue this process, marking scholars as visited and enqueuing their unvisited connections, until we reach Pam.\n\nThe order of scholars visited will give us the shortest path from Raj to Pam. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Raj (3)\n2. Amir (1)\n3. Wim (2)\n4. Eva (14)\n5. Pam (13)\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir, Wim, Eva, Pam"
