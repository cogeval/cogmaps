Wit.ai is a cognitive computing API that enables you to create artificial intelligence by adding an assistant to any of your applications. It understands what the conversation will be, interprets it and sends an appropriate response or action.\nWit.ai has 4 models:\nWit.ai.com contains natural language processing and language generation. It has two functionalities:\nAPI based on LSTM model.\nGUI based on Spark and Tensorflow.\nAPI documentation can be accessed here.\nThe Wit.ai.com service has a maximum execution limitation.\nTo create you first account you need to register here. It is good to start from the Wit.ai.com page and follow their guides for learning how to use the API. You will find the following guides:\nLearn How to Work with Entities and Intentions\nLearn How to Generate Conversations\nLearn How to Extend the NLP System by Adding Custom Languages\nThe LSTM model runs at 21,000 tokens, while the Spark model runs at 36,000 tokens. If you reach max tokens, for example, 20 million tokens in Spark, you will receive the response: \u201cSorry, your request for tokens exceeds the maximum limit. Please reduce your max_tokens parameter to your desired tokens.\u201d If you need to continue with the request or the API is not responding properly, then upgrade the Wit.ai account. Wit.ai has 3 account types, and you need to update it according to your needs.\nWhen you create an application for the LSTM model, you can call it with the following code:\nvar lsp = require(\u2018wit.ai-latest.js\");\nvar api = lsp.createAPI({\nlang: \u2018en\u2019});\nvar dialogue = api.newDialog().lang();\nTo create a conversation in Python using the Spark model, write the following code:\nfrom wit.ai.spark import SparkApi, SparkIntentEndpoint\napi = SparkApi"
