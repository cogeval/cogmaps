The scholars are connected as follows:\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\nRaj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\nNisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\nReza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\nKim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\nIan is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\nMoin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\nPuja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\nSara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\nPam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\nMatt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\nEva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nStep 2: Looking for the connected scholars and the number of books they are donating.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that the following scholars are connected:\nAmir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Kim, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva.\nThe number of books they are donating is as follows:\nAmir: 0 (as he is not donating any books)\nWim: 0 (as he is not donating any books)\nRaj: 50 (as he is donating 50 books)\nJing: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\nReza: 0 (as he is not donating any books)\nNisha: 50 (as she is donating 50 books)\nKim: 10 (as she is donating 10 books)\nIan: 0 (as he is not donating any books)\nPuja: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\nSara: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\nPari: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\nPam: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\nMatt: 10 (as he is donating 10 books)\nEva: 0 (as she is not donating any books)\n\nStep 3: Finding the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that the person with the maximum number of books is Raj, who is donating 50 books. The shortest path to Raj is through Wim, as there is only one connection between them. Therefore, the shortest path to Raj is:\nAmir -> Wim -> Raj\n\nStep 4: Listing the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nThe scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, are:\nAmir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Kim, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva.\n\nAnswer: (Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Kim, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva)"
