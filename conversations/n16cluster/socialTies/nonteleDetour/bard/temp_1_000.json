Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Amir and Reza are no longer connected, we cannot take the path Amir, Amy, Pari.\n2. We can use Wei's instant connection portal to skip ahead to Pari, the scholar with the most books.\n3. However, we cannot take the path Amir, Wei, Pari, because Amir is no longer connected to Reza.\n4. Therefore, we take the path Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei.\n\nThis is the shortest path to Pari, the scholar with the most books, from Amir, given the constraints that Amir and Reza are no longer connected and that Amir cannot take the path Amir, Wei, Pari.\n\nNote that the total number of books that Amir can take is 80, which is the number of books that Wei has."
