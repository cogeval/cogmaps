Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of these scholars: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Continue this process, checking the connections of each scholar until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.
