Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Move to the next level of connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n5. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n7. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n8. Check Eva's connections: Wim, Pari, Pam, and Matt.\n9. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n10.

Check Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n\nNow, we have explored all the connections starting from Amir.
