Therefore, Moin has the maximum number of books. \n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Moin, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to Amir, then explore their connections, and so on, until we reach Moin. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\n1. Starting with Amir, we look at the scholars connected to Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. None of these scholars have the maximum number of books, so we continue to explore their connections.\n3. From Wim, we can go to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. From Raj, we can go to Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n5. From Jing, we can go to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. From Reza, we can go to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n7. From Eva, we can go to Wim, Pam, Matt, and Amir. Matt has the maximum number of books.\n8.
