Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each of his connections and keep track of the number of books each person has donated. We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars' names and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar, starting with Moin (50 books) and Matt (10 books).\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has donated more books than the previous maximum, update the maximum number of books and store the scholar's name.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited connections of the current scholar into the queue.\n   - Mark the current scholar as visited.\n   - Update the number of books donated for each unvisited connection based on the current scholar's donation count.\n5. Once the queue is empty, we will have the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin"
