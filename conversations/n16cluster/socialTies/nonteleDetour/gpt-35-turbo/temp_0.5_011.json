Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books and set it to 0.\n5. Initialize a variable to keep track of the scholar with the maximum number of books and set it to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar into the queue.\n7.
