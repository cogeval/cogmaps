Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Wim: Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4.
