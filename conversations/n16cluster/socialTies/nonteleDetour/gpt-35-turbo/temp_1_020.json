Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore all the connected scholars and their connections until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Set up a queue to keep track of the scholars to be explored.\n2. Add Amir to the queue as the starting point.\n3. Set up a visited set to keep track of the scholars already visited.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set Amir's book count to 0 (since he is not donating any books).\n6. Create an empty string to store the path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n7. Set the maximum book count to 0 (initial value).\n8. While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    b. Check if this scholar has donated more books than the current maximum book count.\n        - If yes, update the maximum book count and store the path to this scholar.\n    c. Check all the connected scholars of the current scholar:\n        - If a connected scholar has not been visited, add them to the queue, mark them as visited, and update their book count.\n    d. Continue this process until all connected scholars have been visited.\n9. Return the path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Moin"
