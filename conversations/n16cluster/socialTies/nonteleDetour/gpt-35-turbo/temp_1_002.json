Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will traverse the graph, starting from Amir and moving to the neighboring scholars until we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of books. Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to visit and a set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n3. Create an empty path list to store the current path.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   \n   - If the scholar has the maximum number of books, return the path list with all the scholars visited so far.\n   \n   - Otherwise, iterate over the connections of the current scholar:\n   \n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited yet, enqueue them into the queue, mark them as visited, and add them to the path list.\n     \n5. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found a scholar with the maximum number of books, return a message indicating that there is no path.\n\nApplying these steps to the given information, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha"
