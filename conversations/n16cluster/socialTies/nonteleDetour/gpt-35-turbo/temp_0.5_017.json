Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start by creating a queue and adding Amir to it. Then, we will iterate through the queue, checking each scholar's connections and adding them to the queue if they haven't been visited before. We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. Finally, we will find the scholar with the maximum number of books and return the path from Amir to that scholar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. Set the path from Amir to Amir as an empty list.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the path to the scholar.\n   - Check each of the scholar's connections:\n     - If a connection has not been visited before:\n       - Add the connection to the queue.\n       - Mark the connection as visited.\n       - Update the number of books donated by the connection.\n       - Update the path from Amir to the connection.\n8. Return the path to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Ian, Moin"
