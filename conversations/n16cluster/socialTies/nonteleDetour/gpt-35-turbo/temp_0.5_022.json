Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books to 0 and a variable max_books_scholar to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has more books donated than max_books, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue their connected scholars.\n5. Return the shortest path from Amir to max_books_scholar.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
