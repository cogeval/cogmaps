Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections and keep track of the number of books they have donated. We will continue exploring until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add him to the visited set.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n4. Start a while loop until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar into the queue and add them to the visited set.\n5. Once the queue is empty, we have found the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n6. Trace back the path from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the visited set.\n7. List the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Ian, Moin"
