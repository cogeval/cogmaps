Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable \"max_books\" to 0 and a variable \"max_books_scholar\" to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is not visited, mark it as visited.\n   - If the scholar has more books than \"max_books\", update \"max_books\" and \"max_books_scholar\" with the current scholar's information.\n   - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar (that are not visited) to the queue.\n5. Repeat step 4 until all connected scholars have been visited.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
