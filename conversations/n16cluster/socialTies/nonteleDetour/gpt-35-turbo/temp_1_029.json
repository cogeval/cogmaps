Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Among Amir's connections, Wim has a direct connection with Eva and Matt, who are both connected to Ian.\n4. Ian is connected to Moin, who is connected to Kim, Nisha, and Reza.\n5. Among Ian's connections, Matt has the maximum number of books (10).\n6.
