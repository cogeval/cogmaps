Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the shortest path. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Continue exploring the connections of each scholar until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n   - For Wim's connections (excluding Amir): Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj's connections (excluding Amir and Wim): Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing's connections (excluding Amir, Wim, and Raj): Pam.\n   - For Reza's connections (excluding Amir): Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n   - For Kim's connections (excluding Reza): Nisha, Moin.\n   - For Nisha's connections (excluding Reza and Kim): Wei, Sara.\n   - For Wei's connections (excluding Reza, Kim, and Nisha): Nisha.\n   - For Moin's connections (excluding Kim): Puja, Sara.\n   - For Puja's connections (excluding Moin): Ian, Sara.\n   - For Sara's connections (excluding Moin and Puja): Nisha.\n   - For Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Pam's connections (excluding Pari): Jing, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Matt's connections (excluding Pari and Pam): Eva, Ian.\n   - For Eva's connections (excluding Pari, Pam, and Matt): Wim.\n5. From the connections explored, we can see that the person with the maximum number of books is Moin.\n6. The shortest path from Amir to Moin, including Amir, is: Answer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin."
