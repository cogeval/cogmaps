Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start with Amir and explore each connected scholar level by level until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nFirst, let's construct a graph based on the given connections:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow let's perform the breadth-first search:\n\nLevel 0: Amir\nLevel 1: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nLevel 2: Eva, Wei, Pam, Kim\nLevel 3: Nisha, Moin, Ian, Sara\nLevel 4: Puja, Matt\n\nWe can see that Puja and Matt are at level 4, which is the farthest level from Amir. However, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books. Since Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books, Moin has the maximum number of books. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Kim, Moin"
