Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the maximum number of books encountered so far and the scholar associated with it. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n2. Initialize variables: max_books = 0, max_books_scholar = None.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue. Let's call this scholar \"current_scholar\".\n   - Check if the current_scholar has more books than max_books. If so, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n   - Iterate through all the scholars connected to the current_scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and update its distance from Amir.\n4. Once the queue is empty, we have found the scholar with the maximum number of books. Return the shortest path from Amir to this scholar.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
