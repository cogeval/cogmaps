Among Moin and Matt, Moin has the maximum number of books (50).\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Moin, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm:\n\nStarting from Amir, the process would be as follows:\n\nAmir (0 books) -> Wim (0 books) -> Raj (0 books) -> Jing (0 books) -> Pam (0 books) -> Pari (0 books) -> Puja (0 books) -> Moin (50 books)\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) would be: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin"
