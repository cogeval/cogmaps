Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Amir -> Raj\n3. Amir -> Jing\n4. Amir -> Reza\n\nLet's explore each path and calculate the number of books at each step:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim:\n   - Wim has no books.\n\n2. Amir -> Raj:\n   - Raj has no books.\n\n3. Amir -> Jing:\n   - Jing has no books.\n\n4. Amir -> Reza:\n   - Reza has no books.\n\nSince all the immediate connections of Amir have no books, we need to explore the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to find someone with books.\n\nFrom Wim, the possible paths are:\n1. Wim -> Amir -> Raj\n2. Wim -> Amir -> Jing\n3. Wim -> Amir -> Reza\n\nFrom Raj, the possible paths are:\n1. Raj -> Amir -> Wim\n2. Raj -> Amir -> Jing\n3.
