Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and traverse the network, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start from Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar. Set Amir's donation count to 0.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n    a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    b. Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum donation count. If yes, update the maximum donation count and store the current scholar as the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n    c. Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n    d. For each unvisited connected scholar, update their donation count by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n    e. Mark the current scholar as visited.\n5. The scholar with the maximum number of books will be the final output.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Ian"
