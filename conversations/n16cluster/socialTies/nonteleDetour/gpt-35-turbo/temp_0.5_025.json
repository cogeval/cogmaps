Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Set Amir as the starting point.\n2. Create an empty queue and add Amir to it.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the connections and number of books.\n4. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - If the scholar has more books than the current maximum, update the maximum.\n     - If the scholar has any connections:\n       - Add the connections to the queue.\n       - Add the connections and their number of books to the dictionary.\n6.
