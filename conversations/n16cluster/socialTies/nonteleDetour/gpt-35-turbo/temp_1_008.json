Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar and visit the scholars in order of their distance.\n\nStarting with Amir, we will visit his immediate connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) and update their distances as 1. Then, we will visit the connections of these scholars and update their distances accordingly.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-6.\n\n3. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n\n4. If the scholar has the maximum number of books among the visited scholars so far, record their name and break the loop.\n\n5. Add the unvisited connections of the scholar to the queue and mark them as visited, along with updating their distances.\n\n6. If the queue is empty and no scholar with books has been found, return \"No scholar with books found\".\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei"
