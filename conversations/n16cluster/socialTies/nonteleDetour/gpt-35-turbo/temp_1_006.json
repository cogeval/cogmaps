Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will traverse the scholars' connections, keeping track of the distance from Amir to each scholar. We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar and initialize all distances to infinity except Amir's distance, which is 0.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has and initialize all counts to 0.\n4. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   2. For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar:\n      1. If the distance from Amir to the connected scholar is greater than the distance from Amir to the dequeued scholar plus 1:\n         1. Update the distance from Amir to the connected scholar with the new distance.\n         2. Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n      2. If the number of books the connected scholar has is greater than the number of books the dequeued scholar has:\n         1. Update the number of books the connected scholar has with the new count.\n6. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n7. Follow the path back from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir by choosing the scholars with decreasing distances from Amir.\n8. List the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nLet's start with the implementation.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
