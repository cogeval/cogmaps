Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will create a queue to store the scholars and their corresponding distances from Amir. We will also maintain a dictionary to keep track of the connections between scholars and the number of books each person has.\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue, visited set, and a dictionary to store connections and book counts.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n3. Create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Add the scholar to the shortest path.\n   - If the scholar has the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars (who have not been visited yet) to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the scholar with the maximum number of books, return an empty path.\n\nLet's start implementing this algorithm step by step.\n\nAnswer: Amir"
