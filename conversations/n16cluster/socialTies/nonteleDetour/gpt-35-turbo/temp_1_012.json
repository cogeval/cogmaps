Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, I will explore each connected scholar and keep track of the distance from Amir. \n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent of each scholar.\n5. Initialize the distance of Amir to 0 and set Amir as his own parent.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   c. Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books.\n   d. If yes, stop the search and backtrack to find the shortest path.\n   e. If no, enqueue all connected but unvisited scholars, update their distance and parent, and add them to the visited set.\n7. Backtrack from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the parent dictionary, and create a list of scholars in order.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt"
