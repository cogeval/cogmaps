Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Update the shortest path dictionary by setting the current scholar's shortest path as the shortest path to the previous scholar plus the current scholar's name.\n     - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n6. Retrieve the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books from the dictionary.\n\nNow, let's execute the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
