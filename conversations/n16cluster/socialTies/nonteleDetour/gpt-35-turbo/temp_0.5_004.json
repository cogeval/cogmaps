Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and traverse the graph, keeping track of the path and the number of books each person has donated.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable \"max_books\" to 0 and a variable \"max_books_person\" to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a person from the queue.\n   - Mark the person as visited.\n   - If the person has donated more books than \"max_books\", update \"max_books\" and \"max_books_person\".\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the person to the queue.\n   - Keep track of the path from Amir to the current person.\n5. Return the path from Amir to \"max_books_person\", including Amir.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given information:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari"
