Start with Amir.\n2. Explore the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Explore the connections of Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Explore the connections of Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Explore the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Explore the connections of Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n7.

Explore the connections of Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n17. Explore the connections of Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections and reached the end of the breadth-first search.\n\nNow, we can see that Matt has the maximum number of books (10). To find the shortest path from Amir to Matt, we can backtrack from Matt to Amir using the connections we have explored. The shortest path would be:\n\nAmir, Eva, Matt\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Amir, Eva, Matt"
