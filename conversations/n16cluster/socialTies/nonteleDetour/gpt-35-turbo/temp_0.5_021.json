We will start from Amir and explore the connections one level at a time until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, we check his connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. From Wim, we check his connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. From Raj, we check his connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. From Jing, we check his connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n5. From Reza, we check his connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n6. From Eva, we check her connections: Wim, Pari, Pam, and Matt.\n7. From Wei, we check his connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n8. From Nisha, we check her connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n9. From Kim, we check his connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n10.

From Pari, we check her connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n15. From Pam, we check her connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n16. From Matt, we check his connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n\nBased on the connections, we can see that Matt has the maximum number of books.
