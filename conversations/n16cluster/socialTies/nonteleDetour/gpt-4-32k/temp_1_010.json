Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

The goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nLooking at the connections given:\n\n1. Start at Amir, who is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Neither Wim, Raj, Jing, nor Reza is directly connected to Moin, so we need to look at their connections. \n3. Wim is connected to Eva but Eva is not connected to Moin, so we discard this path. \n4. Raj is connected to Wei but Wei is not connected to Moin, so we discard this path.\n5. Jing is connected to Pam but Pam is not connected to Moin, so we discard this path.\n6. Reza is connected to Kim and Kim is directly connected to Moin.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
