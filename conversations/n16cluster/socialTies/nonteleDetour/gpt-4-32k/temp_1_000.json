Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

None of these scholars are directly connected to Moin, who has the maximum number of books. \n\nLooking at the connections, Amir can reach Moin in two ways:\n1. Amir \u2192 Wim \u2192 Eva \u2192 Matt \u2192 Ian \u2192 Moin\n2. Amir \u2192 Raj \u2192 Wei \u2192 Kim \u2192 Moin\n\nHowever, even though the first path passes by Matt, who has 10 books, it doesn't make sense to take them because Moin has more (50 books). Therefore, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books starts from Amir and goes through Raj, Wei, and Kim, finally reaching Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"
