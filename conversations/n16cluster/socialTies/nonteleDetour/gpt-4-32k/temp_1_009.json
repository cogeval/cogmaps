Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. From the above, both Wim and Reza are not directly connected to Moin. Thus, they will not be considered in the shortest path.\n3. Raj is directly connected to Wei, but Wei is not directly connected to Moin. So this path won't be considered.\n4. Jing is directly connected to Pam.\n5. Pam is directly connected to Pari.\n6. Pari is directly connected to Puja.\n7. Puja is directly connected to Moin.\n\nBy following the trail of scholars, I found the shortest path from Amir to Moin. Each step in this path involves directly moving from one scholar to another.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin"
