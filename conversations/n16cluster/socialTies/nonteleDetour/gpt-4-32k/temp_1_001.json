Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

The ones with books are Moin who has 50 books and Matt with 10. Moin has more books, so he will be our end target. \n\nStarting from Amir, let's find the shortest path to Moin:\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\nLooking at the connections of these scholars:\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva, but none of them are Moin.\n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei, but none of them are Moin.\n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam, but none of them are Moin.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is further connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."

None of them are directly connected to Moin. \n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. None of them are directly connected to Moin.\n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.
