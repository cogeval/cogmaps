Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Between them, Moin donated the most books (50 books), so the goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nNow, the connections given in the problem are like a graph, so we need to look for the shortest path between Amir and Moin. \n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. However, none of these individuals are directly connected to Moin.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Moin seems to be through Raj and Wei. So the path is:\n\nAmir -> Raj -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin\n\nWe don't need to include Matt because we are only interested in the scholar with the most books. Therefore, the scholar names in order, including Amir, are Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"
