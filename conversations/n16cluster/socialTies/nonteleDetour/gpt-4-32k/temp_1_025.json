Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

From these connections, Wim can further connect us to Eva, Raj can connect us to Wei, and Reza can connect us to Kim. \n\nKim, in turn, is connected to Moin, who has the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin would be:\n\n1. Amir to Reza\n2. Reza to Kim\n3. Kim to Moin\n\nThis route does not require passing through any additional scholars and is therefore the most efficient. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
