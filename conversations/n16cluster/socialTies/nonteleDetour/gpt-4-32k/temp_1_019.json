Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Reza's connections lead back to the same group except for Wei, who leads to another group (Wei, Nisha, Kim, Raj) which doesn't include Moin or Matt. It means we need to select a route from either Wim, Raj or Jing. \n\nUpon inspecting the connections, Raj has a connection to Wei. Wei does not lead to Moin or Matt, so we need to skip this path. Wim's connections lead to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Eva has a connection with Matt, but Matt has lesser books than Moin, so this path will be excluded as well.\n\nThat leaves Jing, who has a connection with Pam. Pam is connected with Pari and Pari is connected to Puja. Puja finally leads us to Moin, who has the maximum books. So, the shortest path from Amir to Moin will be:\n\nAmir -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Puja -> Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin"

We already know from the previous path exploration that Raj's and Wim's paths do not lead to Moin, who has the maximum number of books. Therefore, we again have to go through Jing. \n\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. From Pam, the path goes through Pari, then Puja, and finally reaches Moin, the person with the maximum number of books. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, after the disagreement between Amir and Reza, will be:\n\nAmir -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Puja -> Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin"
