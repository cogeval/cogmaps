Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

This path includes 6 scholars.\n\nPath to Matt: Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt. This path includes 4 scholars.\n\nSince Moin has the maximum number of books (50 books), we have to find the shortest path to Moin. However, the shortest path is to Matt who has fewer books. So, we need to find an alternative path to Moin.\n\nAlternative path to Moin: Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin. This path includes 4 scholars, which is the same length as the path to Matt but leads to the scholar with more books.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the most books (Moin) is Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
