Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

None of them are Moin, so look at their connections.\n\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. None of these are Moin, so continue looking.\n\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Here is the connection to Moin from Kim.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person (Moin) with the maximum number of books is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."

None of them are Moin, so look at their connections.\n\nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of these are Moin, so continue looking.\n\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Here is the connection to Moin from Kim.\n\nBut there's a problem - there's no direct connection between Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, and Jing) to either Kim or Wei.\n\nEva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Here is the connection to Wim from Eva, who is also directly connected to Amir. \n\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. So we have found a connection from Amir to Moin, but it's more roundabout.\n\nThe path, therefore, from Amir to the person (Moin) with the maximum number of books considering the disconnect with Reza is through Wim, Eva, Pari, Puja, and then finally Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari, Puja, Moin."
