Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Sara:\n\n1. Start from Amir.\n2. Go to Raj (Amir -> Raj).\n3. From Raj, go to Wei (Amir -> Raj -> Wei).\n4. From Wei, go to Nisha (Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha).\n5. From Nisha, go to Sara (Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara).\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is Amir, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
