None of these scholars are directly connected to Nisha, so we need to find the shortest path through them. \n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n7. Among these, only Wei and Reza are connected to Nisha. \n8. Since Raj is directly connected to Wim and Wei, and Wei is directly connected to Nisha, the shortest path from Wim to Nisha is through Raj and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
