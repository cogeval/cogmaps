Nisha is connected to Sara but not Pam, Reza is connected to Amir but not Pam, Kim is connected to Moin but not Pam, and Raj is connected to Amir and Wim but not Pam. \n\nAmir, however, is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Pam, which means Raj and Amir form a link from Wei to Pam.\n\nSo the shortest path from Wei to Pam is: Wei - Raj - Amir - Jing - Pam.\n\nThus, the order of the scholars would be: Wei, Raj, Amir, Jing, Pam. \n\nAnswer: Wei, Raj, Amir, Jing, Pam"
