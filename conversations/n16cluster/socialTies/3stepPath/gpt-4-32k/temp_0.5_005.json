The scholars connected to Wim are Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n2. Check each of these scholars' connections to see if Kim is among them. Kim is not directly connected to any of them.\n3. Move to the second level of connections. For Amir, the second level of connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. For Raj, the second level of connections are Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. For Jing, the second level of connections are Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. For Eva, the second level of connections are Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Check each of these scholars' connections to see if Kim is among them. Kim is directly connected to Wei and Reza.\n5. Since Wei and Reza are connected to Raj and Amir respectively, and Raj and Amir are connected to Wim, the shortest path from Wim to Kim can be either Wim-Raj-Wei-Kim or Wim-Amir-Reza-Kim.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Wei, Kim"
