None of these scholars is Sara, so I must examine the next degree of connections.\n\nFrom Wim, we can reach Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (already considered).\n\nFrom Pari, we can reach Puja, Pam, Matt, and Eva (already considered).\n\nFrom Pam, we can reach Jing, Pari (already considered), Matt (already considered), and Eva (already considered).\n\nFrom Matt, we can reach Pari (already considered), Pam (already considered), Eva (already considered), and Ian.\n\nFrom the second degree of connections, only Puja and Ian lead to new connections. \n\nPuja connects to Pari (already considered), Ian (already considered), Sara, and Moin. \n\nIan connects to Moin, Puja (already considered), Sara (already considered), and Matt (already considered).\n\nFrom here, we can see that the shortest path from Eva to Sara is through Pari and Puja. Eva connects to Pari, who connects to Puja, who connects to Sara.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path of scholars from Eva to Sara is: Eva, Pari, Puja, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Puja, Sara"
