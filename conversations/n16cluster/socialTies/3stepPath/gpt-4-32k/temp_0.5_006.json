From Wim, we can reach Puja through several paths:\n   - Wim -> Eva -> Pari -> Puja\n   - Wim -> Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Puja\n   - Wim -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara -> Puja\n   - Wim -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Puja\n\nBy counting the steps, it is clear that the shortest path from Wim to Puja is through Eva and Pari. So the scholar numbers in order are: Wim, Eva, Pari, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Eva, Pari, Puja."
