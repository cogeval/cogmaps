Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.

Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n4. Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n5. Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n6. Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n7. Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n8. Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n9. Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n10. Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n\nStarting from Wim, we need to find the shortest path to Kim.\n\nLooking at Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva), we see that both Amir and Raj are directly connected to someone who is connected to Kim (Amir -> Reza -> Kim, Raj -> Wei -> Kim). Let's choose the path through Amir since it seems to be the shortest: Wim -> Amir -> Reza -> Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Kim is Wim, Amir, Reza, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Reza, Kim"
