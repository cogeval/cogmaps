These are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nThe task is to find the shortest path from Amir to Sara. \n\nFirst, examine the connections of Amir's direct connections:\n\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. No connection to Sara.\n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. No direct connection to Sara, but Wei is connected to Nisha who is in turn connected to Sara.\n- Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. No connection to Sara.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Nisha is connected to Sara.\n\nThis suggests two possible paths: Amir-Raj-Wei-Nisha-Sara or Amir-Reza-Nisha-Sara.\n\nSince both paths have the same length, either one can be considered the shortest path from Amir to Sara. We choose one arbitrarily.\n\nFinally, provide the names in order of the chosen shortest path from Amir to Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Nisha, Sara"
