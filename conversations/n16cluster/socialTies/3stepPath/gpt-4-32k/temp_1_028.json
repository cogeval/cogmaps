We have Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\nStep 3: Check if any of these connected scholars are directly connected to Reza. We know that Jing and Eva are not connected to Reza from the given list.\nStep 4: Review connections for Pari. Pari is not connected to Reza.\nStep 5: Review connections for Matt. Matt is not connected to Reza.\nStep 6: Since none of Pam's connections lead directly to Reza, we need to go one step further.\nStep 7: Next, look at the second level of connections - the scholars who are connected to Pam's connections. These include the connections of Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\nStep 8: Upon reviewing the connections, we find that Amir (connected to Jing) is connected to Reza. \nStep 9: So the shortest path from Pam to Reza is Pam --> Jing --> Amir --> Reza.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Amir, Reza"
