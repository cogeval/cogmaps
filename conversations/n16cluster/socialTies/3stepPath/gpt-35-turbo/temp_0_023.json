If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Sara.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are connected to Sara. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, followed by the connection to Sara.\n5. If not, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n   - For Pari, check Pam, Matt, and Puja.\n   - For Pam, check Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - For Matt, check Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - For Wim, check Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. Repeat step 4 for each connection until Sara is found.\n7. If Sara is not found, there is no path from Eva to Sara.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Puja, Sara"
