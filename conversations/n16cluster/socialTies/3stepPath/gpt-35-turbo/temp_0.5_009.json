Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited.\n3. Add Raj to the queue.\n4. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n5. Add Raj to the visited set.\n6. Create a path dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Raj to each node.\n7. Set the path for Raj as an empty list.\n8. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Matt, stop the search and return the path from Raj to Matt.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Update the path dictionary by appending the neighbor to the path of the dequeued node.\n9. If Matt is not found, return an empty list.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Raj to Matt:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Ian, Matt"
