We will keep track of the order in which we visit the scholars.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n2. Add Jing to the queue and mark Jing as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue (current scholar).\n   b. If the current scholar is Nisha, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited:\n      - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Jing to Nisha.\n\nNow let's execute the algorithm and find the shortest path from Jing to Nisha:\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
