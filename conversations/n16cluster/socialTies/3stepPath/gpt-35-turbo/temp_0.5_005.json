Check if Wim is connected to Kim directly. If yes, then the shortest path is just Wim and Kim. Answer: Wim, Kim.\n3. If Wim is not directly connected to Kim, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n4. Add Wim's connections to a queue (in the order they appear in the question): Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n5. Remove Wim from the queue.\n6. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if they are connected to Kim directly. If yes, then the shortest path is Wim, Amir, Kim. Answer: Wim, Amir, Kim.\n7. If Amir is not directly connected to Kim, add Amir's connections to the end of the queue (Wim, Raj, Jing, Eva).\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until either Kim is found or the queue is empty.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we will find that the shortest path from Wim to Kim is: Wim, Amir, Reza, Kim. Answer: Wim, Amir, Reza, Kim."
