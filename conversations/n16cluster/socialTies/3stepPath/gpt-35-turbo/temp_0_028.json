If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Reza.\n3. If not, check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n4. Check if any of these connections are directly connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, followed by the connection to Reza.\n5. If not, check the connections of Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Reza is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n2. None of these connections are directly connected to Reza.\n3. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. None of these connections are directly connected to Reza.\n5.
