Add Wim to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-6.\n4. Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n5. Check if the dequeued node is Ian. If it is, stop the search and output the path.\n6. If the dequeued node is not Ian, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited. Repeat step 3.\n7. If the queue becomes empty and Ian is not found, there is no path from Wim to Ian.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Wim to Ian:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Ian"
