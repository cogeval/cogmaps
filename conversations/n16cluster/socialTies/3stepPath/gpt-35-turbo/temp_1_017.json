Starting with Reza, we will explore the connections of each scholar one by one, until we reach Pam. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Reza to Pam:\n\n1. Start with Reza (scholar number 6).\n2. Reza is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Kim (scholar number 12), Nisha (scholar number 11), and Wei (scholar number 9).\n3. Amir is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n4. Kim is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n5. Nisha is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n6. Wei is connected to Raj (scholar number 3), Nisha (scholar number 11), Reza (scholar number 6), and Kim (scholar number 12).\n7. Raj is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n8. Nisha is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n9. Reza is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n10. Kim is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n11. Raj is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Wim (scholar number 2), Jing (scholar number 4), and Wei (scholar number 9).\n12. Amir is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n13. Wim is not Pam, so we move to the next connection.\n14. Jing is connected to Amir (scholar number 1), Wim (scholar number 2), Raj (scholar number 3), and Pam (scholar number 14).\n15. Pam is found! \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Reza to Pam is: Reza, Wei, Raj, Jing, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Wei, Raj, Jing, Pam"
