We start at Raj and explore each of Raj's connections one by one, keeping track of the path. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at Raj.\n2. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. We add these scholars to a queue and mark Raj as visited.\n3. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Amir.\n4. Amir is not connected to Matt, so we add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n5. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Wim.\n6. Wim is connected to Matt, so we have found the shortest path. The path from Raj to Matt is: Raj, Amir, Wim, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir, Wim, Matt"
