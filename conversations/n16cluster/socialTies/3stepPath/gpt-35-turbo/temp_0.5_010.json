If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   c. If not, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n   d. Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n4. Repeat steps 3a-3d until either Sara is found or the queue becomes empty.\n\nUsing the given connections, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with Raj.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Dequeue Raj.\n4.
