Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Moin, we have found the shortest path. Add it to the shortest path list.\n   - Otherwise, mark the dequeued node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n6. Finally, return the shortest path list.\n\nApplying this algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
