We will start from Wei and explore the connections of each scholar until we reach Puja.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Wei to the queue and mark Wei as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   2. If the dequeued scholar is Puja, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   3. Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Wei to Puja.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given connections:\n\nAnswer: Wei, Raj, Puja"
