If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Wei.\n3. If Eva is not connected to Wei, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add Eva's connections to the queue in the order they were mentioned (Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim).\n5. Remove Eva from the queue.\n6. Take the next scholar from the queue (Pari) and check if Pari is connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pari, Wei. If not, add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja) to the end of the queue.\n7. Remove Pari from the queue.\n8. Take the next scholar from the queue (Pam) and follow the same process.\n9. Repeat steps 6-8 until Wei is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Eva to Wei is:\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Puja, Ian, Moin, Kim, Wei"
