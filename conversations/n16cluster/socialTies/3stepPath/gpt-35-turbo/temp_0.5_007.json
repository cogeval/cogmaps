We will start at Wim and explore each scholar connected to Wim, then move on to their connections until we reach Ian.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from Wim, we explore the scholars directly connected to Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n\n2. Among these scholars, none of them is Ian, so we move on to the next level of connections.\n\n3. From Amir, we explore his connections: Reza. \n\n4. From Raj, we explore his connections: Wei.\n\n5. From Jing, we explore her connections: Pam.\n\n6. From Eva, we explore her connections: Pari.\n\n7. Among these new connections, none of them is Ian, so we move on to the next level of connections.\n\n8. From Reza, we explore his connections: Kim.\n\n9. From Wei, we explore his connections: Nisha.\n\n10. From Pam, we explore her connections: Sara.\n\n11. From Pari, we explore her connections: Matt.\n\n12. Among these new connections, we find Ian connected to Matt.\n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path from Wim to Ian is:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin, Ian"
