Check each connection's connections, excluding those that have already been visited. \n   - For Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - For Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - For Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each new connection until Puja is found or all connections have been visited.\n5. If Puja is found, return the path from Reza to Puja.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Reza to Puja: \n\nReza, Amir, Wim, Eva, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir, Wim, Eva, Puja."
