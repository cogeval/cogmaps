Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the list of scholars visited.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found Pari, there is no path from Raj to Pari.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Raj.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Mark Raj as visited.\n4. Dequeue Raj. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Enqueue Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Dequeue Amir. Amir is not Pari. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Enqueue Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n6. Dequeue Wim. Wim is not Pari. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Enqueue Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n7. Dequeue Jing. Jing is not Pari. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Enqueue Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n8. Dequeue Wei. Wei is not Pari. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Enqueue Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n9. Dequeue Reza. Reza is not Pari. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Enqueue Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n10. Dequeue Pam. Pam is not Pari. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Enqueue Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n11. Dequeue Nisha. Nisha is not Pari. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Enqueue Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n12. Dequeue Kim. Kim is not Pari. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Enqueue Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n13. Dequeue Matt. Matt is not Pari. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Enqueue Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n14. Dequeue Eva. Eva is not Pari. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Enqueue Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n15. Dequeue Moin. Moin is not Pari. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Enqueue Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n16. Dequeue Ian. Ian is not Pari. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.
