Starting from Jing, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the shortest path to Puja. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Jing to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Puja, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each connected scholar that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Keep track of the path from Jing to the connected scholar.\n4. If the search ends without finding Puja, there is no path from Jing to Puja.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Puja:\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Puja"
