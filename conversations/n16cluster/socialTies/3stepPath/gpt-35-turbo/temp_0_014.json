Check if Jing is connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, Puja.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of these scholars are connected to Puja directly. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the connecting scholar, Puja.\n5. If not, check the connections of the connecting scholars: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Puja is found or all connections are exhausted.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Jing.\n2. Jing is not directly connected to Puja.\n3. Check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Raj is connected to Puja directly. So the shortest path is Jing, Raj, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Puja"
