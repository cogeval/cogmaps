Start with Pam as the initial node.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Pam.\n3. Create a visited set to keep track of visited nodes and add Pam to the set.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the distance from each node to Pam. Set the distance from Pam to 0.\n5. Create a dictionary to store the previous node for each node. Set the previous node for Pam to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n    - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n        - Enqueue the neighbor.\n        - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n        - Set the distance of the neighbor to the distance of the dequeued node + 1.\n        - Set the previous node of the neighbor to the dequeued node.\n        - If the neighbor is Reza, stop the search.\n7. If Reza is found, construct the shortest path by following the previous nodes from Reza to Pam.\n8. Return the scholar numbers in order, including Pam, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Amir, Reza"
