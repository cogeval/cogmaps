Check if Pam is connected to Wei directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Wei.\n3. If not, check Pam's connections (Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva).\n4. Add Pam's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Jing).\n6. Check if Jing is connected to Wei directly. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, Jing, and Wei.\n7. If not, add Jing's connections (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Wei is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Pam is not directly connected to Wei.\n3. Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n4. Queue: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Jing).\n6. Jing is not directly connected to Wei.\n7. Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n8. Queue: Pari, Matt, Eva, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n9. Take the first scholar from the queue (Pari).\n10.
