Enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n4. Create an empty path dictionary to store the shortest path from Wim to each scholar.\n5. Set the path of Wim as [Wim].\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the queue and call it current_scholar.\n    - If the current_scholar is Nisha, break out of the loop.\n    - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current_scholar, do the following:\n        - If the scholar has not been visited, enqueue the scholar, mark it as visited, and update the path of the scholar as the path of the current_scholar followed by the scholar itself.\n7. The shortest path from Wim to Nisha can be obtained by accessing the path[Nisha].\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
