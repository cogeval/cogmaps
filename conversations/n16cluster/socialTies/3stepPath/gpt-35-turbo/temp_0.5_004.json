Starting from Wim, we will explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach Nisha.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from Wim to Nisha:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Add these connections to the queue: [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva].\n4. Take the first connection from the queue: Amir.\n5. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n6. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Raj, Jing, Reza].\n7. Take the next connection from the queue: Raj.\n8. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n9. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Jing, Wei].\n10. Take the next connection from the queue: Jing.\n11. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n12. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Raj, Pam].\n13. Take the next connection from the queue: Raj.\n14. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n15. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Jing, Wei].\n16. Take the next connection from the queue: Jing.\n17. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n18. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Raj, Pam].\n19. Take the next connection from the queue: Raj.\n20. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n21. Since Wim is already visited, skip it. Add the other connections to the queue: [Jing, Wei].\n22. Take the next connection from the queue: Wei.\n23. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n24. Nisha is found! The shortest path from Wim to Nisha is: Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
