Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Add Amir's connections to a queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Mark Amir as visited.\n5. Remove Amir from the queue.\n6. Take the next scholar from the queue: Wim.\n7. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n8. Since Amir is already visited, skip Amir.\n9. Add Wim's unvisited connections to the queue: Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n10. Mark Wim as visited.\n11. Remove Wim from the queue.\n12. Take the next scholar from the queue: Raj.\n13. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n14. Since Amir and Wim are already visited, skip them.\n15. Add Raj's unvisited connections to the queue: Jing and Wei.\n16. Mark Raj as visited.\n17. Remove Raj from the queue.\n18. Take the next scholar from the queue: Jing.\n19. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n20.
