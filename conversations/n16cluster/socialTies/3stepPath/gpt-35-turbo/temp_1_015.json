Starting from Jing, we will explore the connections of each scholar one by one until we reach Ian. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with Jing's scholar number (assume Jing's scholar number is 1).\nQueue: [1]\nVisited: [1]\n\n2. Dequeue the first scholar number from the queue (1) and check its connections.\nConnections of 1: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\nSince none of the connections are Ian, we enqueue them if they are not visited yet.\nQueue: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\nVisited: [1]\n\n3. Dequeue the next scholar number from the queue (Amir) and check its connections.\nConnections of Amir: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\nSince none of the connections are Ian, we enqueue them if they are not visited yet.\nQueue: [Wim, Raj, Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\nVisited: [1, Amir]\n\n4. Dequeue the next scholar number from the queue (Wim) and check its connections.\nConnections of Wim: [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\nSince none of the connections are Ian, we enqueue them if they are not visited yet.\nQueue: [Raj, Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\nVisited: [1, Amir, Wim]\n\n5. Dequeue the next scholar number from the queue (Raj) and check its connections.\nConnections of Raj: [Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei]\nSince none of the connections are Ian, we enqueue them if they are not visited yet.\nQueue: [Pam, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei]\nVisited: [1, Amir, Wim, Raj]\n\n6. Dequeue the next scholar number from the queue (Pam) and check its connections.\nConnections of Pam: [Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva]\nSince none of the connections are Ian, we enqueue them if they are not visited yet.\nQueue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva]\nVisited: [1, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\n\n7.
