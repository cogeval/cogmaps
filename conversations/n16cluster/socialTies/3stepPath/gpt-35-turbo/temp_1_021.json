Check if Eva is connected to Wei. If yes, we're done.\n3. If not, explore the connections of Eva's immediate neighbors: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. Among these neighbors, check if any of them is connected to Wei. If yes, add Wei to the path and we're done.\n5. If none of the immediate neighbors are connected to Wei, expand the search by exploring the connections of the neighbors' neighbors.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until Wei is found or all connections have been explored.\n\nLet's start the search:\n\n1. Eva is not directly connected to Wei, so we move to her immediate neighbors: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n2. None of them is connected to Wei, so we need to explore further.\n3. Among the neighbors' neighbors, we have the following connections:\n   - Pari's neighbors: Puja, Ian, and Sara.\n   - Pam's neighbors: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva (already visited).\n   - Matt's neighbors: Pari, Pam, Eva (already visited), and Ian.\n   - Wim's neighbors: Amir, Raj, Jing (already visited), and Eva (already visited).\n4. Among these connections, we have Puja, Ian, and Sara, who are connected to Wei.\n5. Since Puja is directly connected to Wei, we add Wei to the path and we're done.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Eva to Wei is:\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Puja, Wei"
