If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Ian.\n3. If not, check if Jing is connected to any other scholar who is directly connected to Ian. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the intermediate scholar, and Ian.\n4. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar who is directly connected to Ian. Repeat this step until Jing is connected to a scholar who is directly connected to Ian or there are no more connections to explore.\n5. Once we find the shortest path, list the scholar numbers in order, including Jing, separated by commas.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Ian:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Ian.\n3. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Raj is connected to Wei. Reza is connected to Kim. Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Ian.\n4. The shortest path from Jing to Ian is Jing, Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin, Ian.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin, Ian"
