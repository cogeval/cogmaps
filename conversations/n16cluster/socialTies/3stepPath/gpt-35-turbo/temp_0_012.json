Check if Jing is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Nisha.\n3. If not, check all the scholars connected to Jing (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam).\n4. Add these scholars to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if Amir is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, Amir, and Nisha.\n6. If not, add all the scholars connected to Amir (Wim, Raj, and Reza) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Nisha is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Jing.\n2. Jing is not connected to Nisha.\n3. Scholars connected to Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Queue: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n6. Amir is connected to Nisha.\n   - Shortest path: Jing, Amir, Nisha.\n   - Final outcome: Answer: Jing, Amir, Nisha."
