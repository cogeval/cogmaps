Enqueue Wei into the queue and add Wei to the visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar, let's call it current_scholar.\n   b. If current_scholar is Eva, we have found the shortest path. Return the list of scholars visited in the order they were visited.\n   c.
