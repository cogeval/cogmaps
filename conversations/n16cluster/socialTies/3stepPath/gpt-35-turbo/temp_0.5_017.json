Start with Reza as the initial node.\n2. Initialize an empty queue and add Reza to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Pam, stop the search and backtrack to find the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Set the parent of the neighbor as the dequeued node in the parent dictionary.\n6. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from Reza to Pam.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Reza to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Reza, Amir, Wim, Eva, Pam"
