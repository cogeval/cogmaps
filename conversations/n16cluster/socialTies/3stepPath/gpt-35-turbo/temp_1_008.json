Create a queue to store the scholars to visit.\n3. Enqueue Raj into the queue.\n4. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n5. Add Raj to the visited set.\n6. Create a parent dictionary to keep track of the parent scholar for each visited scholar.\n7. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Break out of the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each of the scholars connected to the current scholar that have not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Add the connected scholar as the child of the current scholar in the parent dictionary.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n8. If we have not found a path to Pari after visiting all reachable scholars, it means there is no path from Raj to Pari.\n\nNow let's go through the steps and find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Raj.\n2. Enqueue Raj.\n3. Visit Raj.\n4. Dequeue Raj.\n5. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Add Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei to the visited set.\n7. Add Raj as the parent of Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n8. Enqueue Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nContinue the steps until we find Pari or there are no more scholars to visit.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Pari"
