Create an empty queue and enqueue Wei.\n3. Create an empty list to store the path.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Pam, we have found the shortest path. Add Pam to the path and break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the path.\n5. After the loop ends, the path will contain the shortest path from Wei to Pam.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Wei to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Wei, Raj, Amir, Reza, Nisha, Sara, Pari, Pam"
