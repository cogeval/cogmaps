If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Reza.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Check if any of Eva's connections are connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, followed by the connection to Reza.\n5. If not, check the connections of Eva's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Reza is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Eva.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Reza.\n3. Eva's connections are Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4. None of Eva's connections are directly connected to Reza.\n5. Check the connections of Eva's connections:\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. None of the connections of Eva's connections are directly connected to Reza.\n7. Check the connections of the connections of Eva's connections:\n   - Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n8.
