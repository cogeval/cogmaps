Explore all the scholars connected to Wei (Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj).\n3. Explore all the scholars connected to these scholars and keep track of the path taken.\n4. Repeat step 3 until Puja is found or all the scholars have been explored.\n5. If Puja is found, return the shortest path from Wei to Puja.\n\nNow, let's go through the process step by step:\n\nStep 1: Start from Wei.\nAnswer: Wei\n\nStep 2: Explore all the scholars connected to Wei (Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj).\nAnswer: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n\nStep 3: Explore all the scholars connected to these scholars and keep track of the path taken.\n   - From Nisha, we can explore Wei (already visited), Reza (already visited), Kim, and Sara.\n   - From Reza, we can explore Amir, Kim (already visited), Nisha (already visited), and Wei (already visited).\n   - From Kim, we can explore Wei (already visited), Nisha (already visited), Reza (already visited), and Moin.\n   - From Raj, we can explore Amir (already visited), Wim (already visited), Jing, and Wei (already visited).\n\nStep 3 continued: \n   - From Sara, we can explore Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha (already visited).\n   - From Moin, we can explore Ian, Puja, Kim (already visited), and Sara (already visited).\n   - From Jing, we can explore Amir (already visited), Wim (already visited), Raj (already visited), and Pam.\n   - From Pam, we can explore Jing (already visited), Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n\nStep 3 continued:\n   - From Pari, we can explore Pam (already visited), Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - From Matt, we can explore Pari (already visited), Pam (already visited), Eva, and Ian (already visited).\n   - From Eva, we can explore Pari (already visited), Pam (already visited), Matt (already visited), and Wim (already visited).\n\nStep 3 continued:\n   - From Ian, we can explore Moin (already visited), Puja, Kim (already visited), and Sara (already visited).\n\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 until Puja is found or all the scholars have been explored.
