Starting from Eva, we will explore each scholar connected to Eva and continue exploring their connections until we reach Sara.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Eva to Sara:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Add Eva to the queue and mark her as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Sara, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If the search completes without finding Sara, there is no path from Eva to Sara.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given group of scholars:\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Sara"
