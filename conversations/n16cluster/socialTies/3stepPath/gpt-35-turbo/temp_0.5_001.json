Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections one by one until we reach Matt.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir (Scholar 1).\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim (Scholar 2), Raj (Scholar 3), Jing (Scholar 4), and Reza (Scholar 5).\n3. Add Amir's connections to a queue in the order they are checked: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wim) and check their connections.\n5. Wim's connections are: Amir (Scholar 1), Raj (Scholar 3), Jing (Scholar 4), and Eva (Scholar 6).\n6. Since we have already visited Amir, Raj, and Jing, we add Eva to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each scholar in the queue until we reach Matt (Scholar 15).\n8. The shortest path from Amir to Matt is: Amir (1), Wim (2), Raj (3), Wei (11), Nisha (12), Sara (14), Matt (15).\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Matt"
