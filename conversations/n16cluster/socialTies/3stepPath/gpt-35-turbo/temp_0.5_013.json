Starting from Jing, we will explore each scholar connected to Jing and keep track of the visited scholars. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be visited and a visited set to keep track of visited scholars.\n   - Queue: [Jing]\n   - Visited: {Jing}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\n3. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n\n4. Check if the dequeued scholar is Kim. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search. Otherwise, continue to step 5.\n\n5. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited yet.\n   - For Jing, the connected scholars are [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam].\n   - Enqueue: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\n   - Visited: {Jing, Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam}\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until either the queue is empty or Kim is found.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Kim:\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Reza, Kim"
