Start at Eva.\n2. Check if Eva is connected to Sara. If they are connected, the shortest path is just Eva and Sara.\n   Answer: Eva, Sara\n\n3. If Eva is not directly connected to Sara, we need to explore her connections.\n4. From Eva, explore each of her connections and add them to a queue.\n   Answer: Eva, Pari, Matt, Wim\n\n5. Since Sara is not found yet, continue exploring the connections of the scholars in the queue.\n   - From Pari, add Pam to the queue.\n   - From Matt, add Ian to the queue.\n   - From Wim, add Raj to the queue.\n   Answer: Eva, Pari, Matt, Wim, Pam, Ian, Raj\n\n6.
