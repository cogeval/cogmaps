If so, the shortest path is just Eva and Reza.\n3. Otherwise, visit each of Eva's directly connected scholars (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim) in alphabetical order.\n4. If any of these scholars are directly connected to Reza, then the shortest path is Eva, followed by the scholar connected to Reza, and then Reza.\n5. If none of these scholars are directly connected to Reza, repeat steps 3 and 4 for their directly connected scholars until Reza is found.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from Eva to Reza is:\nEva, Wim, Amir, Reza\n\nAnswer: Eva, Wim, Amir, Reza"
