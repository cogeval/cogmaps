If yes, the shortest path is just Eva and Wei.\n3. If not, check Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim).\n4. Add these connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue (Pari).\n6. Check if Pari is connected to Wei. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Pari, and Wei.\n7. If not, add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, and Eva) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Wei is found or the queue is empty.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Eva to Wei is:\n\nAnswer: Eva, Pari, Wei"
