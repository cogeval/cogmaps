The core of the problem can be expressed as: who are the socialites that you must invite first such that every other socialite can be invited by any combination of friends in the shortest possible path? To solve this, generate a new graph with a unique identifier for every pair of socialites (as nodes) that indicates if you must or must not have that friend to invite every single other friend. Once that is mapped run the shortest path problem for that graph (Dijkstra's algorithm applies here). Each attendee in the first set is evident. To get the next best set, give the first set as input to the shortest path problem with that new graph and stop when the shortest path hits the last node - at that point, that set of vertices can be removed from the graph.\n\nNOTE: I solved this challenge with the A* search algorithm for"
