Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We need 4 pairs here for each pair, it is equivalent to connect a scholars with a pair. Hence we need 3 connections to have 9 scholars.\nThere are 3 connections and we have 9 scholars, hence one pair is missed as the count and the description differ. We need 5 pairs instead of 4. Hence we need 2 more connections (i.e. pairs). We have 7 possible pairs. That is 8 scholars.\nAnswer was perfect, just need additional validation\nthere are four densely connected clusters and we get 5 scholars but what's with the \"with a minimum of 2 scholars\"\nanswer was very fine. Thanks\nThe key point here is that to have a densely-connected cluster, that is pair must consist of exactly 2, in this case each of the pairs Wim-Jing, Jing-Reza, Nisha-Pam, Sara-Pam, and Matt-Eva are used at least once thus the pair itself cannot have more than 2 scholars. Thus, to have a densely-connected cluster, each pair in the group will consist of two scholars.\nThe best part is the clarification given by \"there are x clusters\" in the answer which helped most, but after that I understood the problem better with your explaination and cleared this in minutes.
