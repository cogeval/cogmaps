To determine the number of densely-connected clusters, we need to look at each scholar and see if they are connected to themselves.\nStep 1: Let's start by looking at Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars are also connected to Amir, so he is not part of a densely-connected cluster.\nStep 2: Next, let's look at Wim. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Again, none of these scholars are also connected to Wim, so he is not part of a densely-connected cluster.\nStep 3: Moving on to Raj, we see that he is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Only Jing is also connected to Raj, so he is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 4: Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Reza. All of these scholars are also connected to Jing, so she is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nStep 5: Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. None of these scholars are also connected to Wei, so he is not part of a densely-connected cluster.\nStep 6: Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Raj. All of these scholars are also connected to Nisha, so she is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 7: Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. All of these scholars are also connected to Reza, so he is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nStep 8: Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. All of these scholars are also connected to Kim, so she is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 9: Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Only Matt is also connected to Ian, so he is not part of a densely-connected cluster.\nStep 10: Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. All of these scholars are also connected to Moin, so he is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nStep 11: Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. All of these scholars are also connected to Puja, so she is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 12: Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. All of these scholars are also connected to Sara, so she is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nStep 13: Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. All of these scholars are also connected to Pari, so she is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 14: Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. All of these scholars are also connected to Pam, so she is part of one densely-connected cluster.\nStep 15: Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. All of these scholars are also connected to Matt, so he is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nStep 16: Finally, Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. All of these scholars are also connected to Eva, so she is part of two densely-connected clusters.\nBased on the number of densely-connected clusters, the answer is: there are 9 densely-connected clusters."
