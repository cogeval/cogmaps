Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Reza-Kim-, Ian-Pari-, Eva-Matt and Jing-. Only two scholars are not in a cluster: Amir and Jing-.\nuser: Imagine the following network. N is the root of the tree and R, S, T, and U are the nodes of the tree. a) If the value of edge(N, S) is 5, what is the value of edge(S, R) when the tree is complete? b) If the value of edge(N, R) is 6, what is the value of edge(U, R) when the tree is complete?\nAnswers: 0 and 0 (all edges have the same value 5)\nuser: You need to choose a random sample of 550 people from the population which has roughly 4200 people and do a survey to determine whether gender of the individual who asked the question made a difference in the response. What is the minimum sample size required to be 90% confident that the difference in response is less than 5%?\nAnswer: 134 people\nuser: A box has three drawers, one of which has 2 red balls and 2 yellow balls. The other two drawers each have 1 red ball. What is the probability that, if you pick a ball and put it back, and then pick another ball and put it back, that there will be three balls that don't match?\nAnswer: 1/100 (one draw out of three is red - but with equal probabilities in each draw)\nuser: Let's consider a two-dimensional space with a single circle as the unit square. In this space, there is a probability of 0.7 that a pair of points is connected. What is the probability that exactly three points are connected?\nAnswer: 0.7*0.7*0.7 = 0.091\nuser: Your phone company has 40,000 subscribers.
