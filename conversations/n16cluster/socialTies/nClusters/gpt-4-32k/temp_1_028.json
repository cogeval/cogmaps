Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Since Reza, Matt and Wim are part of multiple clusters, these clusters can be combined, forming larger clusters.\n\nStep 2: Combine the clusters based on common members.\nWe end up with two big clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim \n\nCluster 2: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt, Pari, Pam, Eva, Wim\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
