Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

The connection can be one-way (Amir to Wim) or two-way (Amir to Wim and Wim to Amir). \n\nLet's start by grouping scholars:\n\n1. The first cluster contains Amir, Wim, Raj, and Jing. Reza is also connected to Amir but not to Wim, Raj, or Jing, so Reza is not part of this cluster. \n\n2. The second cluster contains Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Kim. While Reza is connected to Amir, the Amir cluster does not connect to Reza's other connections (Wei, Nisha, and Kim), so Reza is not part of the first cluster.\n\n3. The third cluster contains Ian, Moin, Puja, and Sara. \n\n4. The fourth cluster contains Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva. Even though Pam and Eva are connected to scholars from the first cluster (Jing and Wim, respectively), the rest of their connections form a separate group.\n\nAfter mapping out all the connections, we can see that there are four densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
