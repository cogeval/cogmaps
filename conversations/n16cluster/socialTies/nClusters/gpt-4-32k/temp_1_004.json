Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

But since Reza and Kim are part of this group and they are also part of cluster 1, this can still be considered as a densely connected cluster.\n\nCluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara - These scholars are all connected.\n\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva - These scholars are all connected.\n\nNote that some scholars are part of more than one cluster, which is allowable because each cluster is densely connected. Therefore we can see there are 4 densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
