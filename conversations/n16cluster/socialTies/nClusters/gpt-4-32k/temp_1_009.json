Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n5. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n6. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n8. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n9. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n10. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n11. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n12. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n13. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n14. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n15. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n16. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nAfter categorizing, we can see these clusters form:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Kim, Reza, Moin, Sara\nCluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nCluster 5: Pari, Pam, Eva, Wim\n\nNote that scholars can belong to more than one cluster, but within each cluster, everyone is connected to everyone else.\n\nAfter checking the number of scholars in each cluster and ensuring they meet the criteria of having a minimum of two scholars and everyone is connected to everyone else, we can conclude that there are 5 densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
