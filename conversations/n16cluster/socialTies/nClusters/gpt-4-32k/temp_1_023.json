Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva but Eva is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Eva. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei but Wei is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Wei. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam but Pam is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Pam. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei but Kim, Nisha and Wei are not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin.\nWei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj but Raj is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara but Sara is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei but Amir is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Amir. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara but Ian, Puja and Sara are not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Ian, Puja and Sara.\n\nCluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara.\nIan is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt but Matt is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara but Kim is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Kim. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin but Pari is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Pari. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha but Nisha is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Nisha.\n\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva.\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja but Puja is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva but Jing is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Jing. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian but Ian is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Ian. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim but Wim is not connected to all in the cluster so we cannot include Wim.\n\nTo sum up, there are 4 densely-connected clusters of scholars in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
