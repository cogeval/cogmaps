However, since Reza is already mentioned in the first group and has connections with the same, this group can actually be considered as part of the first group, leading to an expanded group of Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, and Kim.\n4. Ian, Moin, Puja, and Sara form the third tightly connected group.\n5. Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva form the fourth group. \n\nSo, we have a total of four densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
