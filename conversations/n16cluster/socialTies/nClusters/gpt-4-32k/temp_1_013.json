Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

They're all connected to each other. Reza is also connected to Amir, but not with Wim, Raj, and Jing, so it doesn't form a cluster with them. This is our first densely-connected cluster.\n\n2. The second cluster consists of Wei, Nisha, and Reza. They're all connected to each other. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, and Reza but not within themselves, so it doesn't form a cluster with them.\n\n3. The third cluster consists of Ian, Moin, Puja, and Sara. They're all connected to each other.\n\n4. The fourth and last cluster consists of Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva. They're all connected to each other.\n\nTherefore, there are four densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
