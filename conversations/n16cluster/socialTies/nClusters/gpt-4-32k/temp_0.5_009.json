Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Kim form another densely-connected cluster.\n3. Ian, Moin, Puja, and Sara form a densely-connected cluster.\n4. Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva form a densely-connected cluster.\n\nHowever, there are some scholars who are part of more than one cluster: Reza is part of both the first and second clusters, and Sara is part of both the third and fourth clusters. This means that we have overlapping clusters, and we need to decide whether to count these as separate clusters or as one larger cluster.\n\nGiven the definition of a densely-connected cluster as a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars, it seems more accurate to count overlapping clusters as separate clusters. This is because each cluster is a group of scholars who are all connected to each other, regardless of connections to scholars outside the cluster.\n\nTherefore, we have four densely-connected clusters of scholars in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
