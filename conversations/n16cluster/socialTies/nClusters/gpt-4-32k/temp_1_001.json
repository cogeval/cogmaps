Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n- All of these scholars are connected to each other. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Similarly, Wim, Raj and Jing are also connected to each other and Amir. Reza is connected to Amir but not to Wim, Raj, or Jing. But since we are told that a densely-connected cluster requires only a minimum of 2 scholars, Reza being connected to Amir keeps him in this cluster.\n\n2. Cluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Kim.\n- Wei, Nisha, Kim are interconnected. Wei is connected to Raj too but since Raj is not directly connected to Nisha or Kim, Wei, Nisha, Kim make a separate cluster.\n\n3. Cluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara.\n- These scholars are connected to each other in a similar way to Cluster 1. Ian connects with Moin, Puja, and Sara. Moin is also connected with Kim but since Kim is not directly connected to Ian, Puja, or Sara, Moin, Ian, Puja, and Sara form a separate cluster.\n\n4. Cluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva.\n- These scholars are interconnected like the first cluster. \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
