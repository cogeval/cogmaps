We can draw an image or a graph to visualize it better.\n\n- Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing and Reza form a densely-connected cluster. They all have mutual connections.\n- Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Kim form another densely-connected cluster. They are also all mutually connected. Reza is present in both clusters, therefore they become a single cluster.\n- Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara form another densely-connected cluster. They are all connected to each other.\n- Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva are another densely-connected cluster. They also all have mutual connections.\n\nCounting these, we can see that there are four clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
