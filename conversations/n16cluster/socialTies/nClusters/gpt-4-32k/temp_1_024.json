Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

The first cluster can be identified around Amir as he is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Wim, Raj, and Jing are also interconnected as they are connected to each other and Amir. Therefore, the first cluster is {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing}. Reza does not connect back to Wim or Raj or Jing, so he is not part of this cluster.\n\n2. Reza connects to Wei, Nisha and Kim. Wei, Nisha, and Kim are also interconnected, forming the second cluster {Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim}.\n\n3. Ian connects to Moin, Puja, and Sara. Similarly, Moin, Puja, and Sara are connected to each other and to Ian, so they form the third cluster {Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara}.\n\n4. Finally, Pari, Pam, Matt, and Eva form the fourth cluster {Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva} as they are all connected to each other.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
