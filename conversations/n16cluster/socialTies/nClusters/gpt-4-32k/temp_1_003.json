Let's see if we can combine some of these clusters because they are connected:\n\nNew Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Eva, Pari, Pam, Matt.\nNew Cluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj, Sara, Moin, Puja, Ian.\n\nThis step eliminated the overlap and created two densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
