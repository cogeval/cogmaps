Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

One potential cluster could be Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza, as they are all connected to each other.\n3. However, since Wei and Nisha are also connected to some members of this group, they could potentially form a larger cluster along with Kim and Moin, who are also connected to some of these scholars. \n4. Another potential cluster could be Ian, Puja, Sara, and Matt who are also connected to each other.\n5. Pari, Pam, Eva could form another cluster as they are connected to each other and the other clusters, but they form a distinct group.  \n6. After examining all the connections, it can be concluded that there are 3 clusters: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, and Moin; Ian, Puja, Sara, and Matt; Pari, Pam, and Eva. \n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
