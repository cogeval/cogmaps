This cluster is formed because each scholar is connected to at least two others within the group.\n\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj. This cluster is formed because each scholar is connected to at least two others within the group.\n\nCluster 3: Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara. This cluster is formed because each scholar is connected to at least two others within the group.\n\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva. This cluster is formed because each scholar is connected to at least two others within the group.\n\nTherefore, there are four densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
