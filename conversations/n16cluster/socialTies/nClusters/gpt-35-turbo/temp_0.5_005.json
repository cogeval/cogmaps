Identify the connected components in the graph:\n   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each unvisited node.\n   - For each search, mark all visited nodes as part of the same connected component.\n   - Repeat the search for any remaining unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited.\n\n3.
