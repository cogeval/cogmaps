Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between scholars. Each scholar will be a node, and the connections between them will be represented by edges.\n\n2. Based on the given connections, we can construct the following graph:\n\n   - Amir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n   - Wim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n   - Raj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n   - Jing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n   - Wei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n   - Nisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n   - Reza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n   - Kim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n   - Ian -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n   - Moin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n   - Puja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n   - Sara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n   - Pari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n   - Pam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n   - Matt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n   - Eva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\n3. Now, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to identify the connected components in the graph.\n\n4. Starting from an unvisited scholar, we perform a DFS or BFS to explore all the connected scholars. Each time we complete a traversal, we increment the count of clusters.\n\n5. We repeat step 4 until all scholars are visited.\n\n6. Based on the given connections, we can see that the connected clusters are as follows:\n\n   - Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Sara, Moin, Puja, Ian, Matt, Eva\n   - Cluster 2: Pari, Pam\n\n7. Therefore, the final outcome is:\n\n   Answer: there are 2 clusters"
