We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\nLet's visualize the connections:\n\nAmir - Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim - Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj - Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing - Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei - Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha - Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza - Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim - Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan - Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin - Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja - Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara - Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari - Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam - Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt - Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva - Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can identify the densely-connected clusters by traversing the graph. We will start with each scholar and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to identify all the connected scholars.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir:\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n   \n   We have traversed all the connected scholars starting from Amir.\n   \n2. Continue with Wei:\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj are already visited scholars.\n   \n   We have traversed all the connected scholars starting from Wei.\n   \n3. Continue with Moin:\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara are already visited scholars.\n   \n   We have traversed all the connected scholars starting from Moin.\n   \n4. Continue with Pari:\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja are already visited scholars.\n   \n   We have traversed all the connected scholars starting from Pari.\n   \n5. No more unvisited scholars left.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
