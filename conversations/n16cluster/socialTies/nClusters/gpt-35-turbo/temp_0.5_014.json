Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4.

Each time we encounter a new scholar, we mark them as visited and continue the traversal until there are no more unvisited scholars connected to the current one. This will give us one cluster.\n\nWe repeat this process for all the scholars, ensuring that we only consider unvisited scholars. Each time we start a new traversal, we have found a new cluster.\n\nLet's perform a DFS starting from each unvisited scholar and count the number of clusters:\n\nStarting from Amir:\n- Amir -> Wim -> Eva\n- Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara\n- Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing\n\nStarting from Jing:\n- Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Eva -> Wim -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Matt\n\nStarting from Ian:\n- Ian -> Moin -> Kim -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing\n- Ian -> Puja -> Matt -> Eva -> Wim -> Amir -> Raj\n\nStarting from Eva:\n- Eva -> Wim -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing\n\nStarting from Pari:\n- Pari -> Pam -> Jing -> Amir -> Wim -> Eva\n- Pari -> Puja -> Ian -> Moin -> Kim -> Wei -> Nisha -> Reza -> Sara -> Matt\n\nStarting from Matt:\n- Matt -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing -> Amir -> Wim -> Eva\n- Matt -> Ian -> Moin -> Kim -> Wei -> Nisha -> Reza -> Sara -> Puja\n\nStarting from Sara:\n- Sara -> Nisha -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing\n\nStarting from Kim:\n- Kim -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara -> Ian -> Moin -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing\n\nStarting from Reza:\n- Reza -> Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Pari ->"
