We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\nHere is a step-by-step approach to finding the densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Create a graph with 16 nodes representing the scholars.\n2. Add edges to the graph based on the connections between scholars described in the information provided.\n3. Identify all the connected components in the graph.\n4. Count the number of connected components that have at least 2 scholars.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with 16 nodes representing the scholars:\n   - Nodes: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva.\n\n2. Add edges to the graph based on the connections between scholars described in the information provided:\n   - Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n   - Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n   - Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n   - Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n   - Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n   - Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n   - Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n   - Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n   - Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n\n3. Identify all the connected components in the graph:\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find connected components.\n   - Starting from each unvisited node, perform a DFS to visit all reachable nodes.\n   - Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Repeat the DFS until all nodes have been visited.\n\n4. Count the number of connected components that have at least 2 scholars:\n   - After performing the DFS, count the number of connected components that have at least 2 nodes.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
