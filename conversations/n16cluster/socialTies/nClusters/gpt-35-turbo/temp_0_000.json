We can represent each person as a node and their connections as edges between the nodes. Then, we can use the concept of connected components to find the densely-connected clusters.\n\nAfter representing the connections in a graph, we can see that there are 5 densely-connected clusters:\n- Paul, Bob, Nick, Sherry\n- Amanda, Peter, John, Daisy\n- Maggie, Alisha, Jennifer, Adam\n- Andrew, William, Russell, Rose\n- Alisa\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
