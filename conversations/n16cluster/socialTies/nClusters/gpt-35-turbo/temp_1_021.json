A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We will create an adjacency list to keep track of the connections.\n\nFirst, let's initialize an empty adjacency list:\n\nAmir: []\nWim: []\nRaj: []\nJing: []\nWei: []\nNisha: []\nReza: []\nKim: []\nIan: []\nMoin: []\nPuja: []\nSara: []\nPari: []\nPam: []\nMatt: []\nEva: []\n\nNext, we will populate the adjacency list based on the given connections:\n\nAmir: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\nWim: [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\nRaj: [Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei]\nJing: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\nWei: [Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj]\nNisha: [Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara]\nReza: [Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei]\nKim: [Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin]\nIan: [Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt]\nMoin: [Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara]\nPuja: [Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin]\nSara: [Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha]\nPari: [Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja]\nPam: [Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva]\nMatt: [Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian]\nEva: [Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim]\n\nNow we will perform a depth-first search (DFS) to identify the connected components.\n\nCreate an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\nInitialize a variable to count the number of clusters.\n\nFor each node in the adjacency list:\n- If the node has not been visited, perform DFS starting from that node.\n- In the DFS, mark the current node as visited and iterate through its neighbors:\n  - If a neighbor has not been visited, recursively perform DFS starting from that neighbor.\n\nAfter performing the DFS for all nodes, the count of clusters will be the answer.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
