Each scholar can be represented as a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars can be represented as edges between the nodes.\n\nLet's go step by step to find the clusters:\n\n1. Start with the first scholar, Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\n2. Now, let's find the clusters:\n   - Starting with Amir, we have the following connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Eva, Wei, Kim, Nisha, Sara, Moin, Ian, Puja, Pari, Pam, Matt.\n   - From this list, we can see that all scholars are connected to each other, forming a single densely-connected cluster.\n\nAnswer: there is 1 cluster."
