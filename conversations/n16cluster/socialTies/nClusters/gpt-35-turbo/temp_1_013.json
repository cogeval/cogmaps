Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can represent each scholar as a node and their connections as edges between nodes.\n\nLet's start by representing the given connections in a graph:\n\nAmir -> [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\nWim -> [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\nRaj -> [Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei]\nJing -> [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\nWei -> [Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj]\nNisha -> [Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara]\nReza -> [Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei]\nKim -> [Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin]\nIan -> [Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt]\nMoin -> [Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara]\nPuja -> [Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin]\nSara -> [Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha]\nPari -> [Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja]\nPam -> [Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva]\nMatt -> [Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian]\nEva -> [Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim]\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected clusters using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We will start with each scholar as a source node and perform DFS to find all the connected scholars. Each time we complete a DFS, we count it as a separate cluster.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. Initialize a variable `cluster_count` to keep track of the number of clusters.\n3. Iterate through each scholar:\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Perform a DFS starting from that scholar, marking all visited nodes.\n     - Increment `cluster_count` by 1.\n4. The final value of `cluster_count` represents the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
