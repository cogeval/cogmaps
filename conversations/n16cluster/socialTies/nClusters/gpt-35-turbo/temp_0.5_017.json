Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar represents a node, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nWe can start by creating an adjacency list or matrix to represent the connections between scholars. Let's create an adjacency list based on the given information:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the connected components. We will start with Amir and explore all the connected scholars. Then, we will move on to the next unvisited scholar and repeat the process until all scholars are visited.\n\nBy performing a DFS or BFS on the given graph, we can find the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara\nCluster 2: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
