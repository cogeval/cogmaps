Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between scholars will be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph representation of the connections:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNext, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to identify the connected components. We will start from each unvisited scholar and explore all the connected scholars using DFS. Each time we finish exploring a connected component, we increment the count of clusters by 1.\n\nLet's perform the DFS algorithm to find the number of densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Initialize the count of clusters to 0.\n2. Initialize a set of visited scholars to an empty set.\n3. For each scholar in the group:\n   a. If the scholar has not been visited:\n      i. Increment the count of clusters by 1.\n      ii. Perform DFS starting from the current scholar, marking all visited scholars.\n4. The final count of clusters is the answer.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
