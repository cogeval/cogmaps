We can represent each scholar as a node and their connections as edges between the nodes. \n\nLet's create a graph representation of this group of scholars:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can identify the densely-connected clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on the graph. \n\nStarting with the first node, we can perform a DFS or BFS to traverse all the connected nodes. Once we have traversed all the connected nodes, we can mark them as visited and move on to the next unvisited node. We repeat this process until all nodes have been visited.\n\nAfter performing the DFS or BFS algorithm, we can count the number of times we performed the traversal. Each traversal represents a densely-connected cluster.\n\nLet's perform a DFS algorithm to find the number of densely-connected clusters:\n\nDFS Algorithm:\n1. Initialize a variable \"clusterCount\" to 0.\n2. Initialize a set \"visited\" to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. For each unvisited node in the graph:\n   a. Perform a DFS traversal starting from that node.\n   b. Increment \"clusterCount\" by 1.\n4. Return the \"clusterCount\".\n\nLet's implement the DFS algorithm:\n\nDFS(StartNode):\n1. Create an empty stack \"stack\" and push the StartNode onto it.\n2. Create an empty set \"visited\" to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. While the stack is not empty:\n   a. Pop a node \"currentNode\" from the stack.\n   b. If \"currentNode\" has not been visited:\n      i. Add \"currentNode\" to the \"visited\" set.\n      ii. For each neighbor \"neighbor\" of \"currentNode\":\n          - Push \"neighbor\" onto the stack if it has not been visited.\n4. Return the \"visited\" set.\n\nNow let's perform the DFS algorithm on the graph:\n\n1. Initialize \"clusterCount\" to 0.\n2. Initialize an empty set \"visited\" to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. For each node in the graph:\n   a. If the node has not been visited:\n      i. Perform a DFS traversal starting from that node.\n      ii. Increment \"clusterCount\" by 1.\n4. Return \"clusterCount\".\n\nPerforming the DFS algorithm on the graph, we find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this group of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
