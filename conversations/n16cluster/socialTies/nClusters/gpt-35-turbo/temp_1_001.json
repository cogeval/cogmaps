A cluster is considered densely-connected if there are at least two scholars connected to each other within the cluster.\n\nFrom the connections, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim\nCluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva\n\nAnswer: There are 4 clusters."
