Each scholar represents a vertex, and the connections between scholars represent edges in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency list representation of the graph:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph to find the connected components. We will start with the first scholar and explore all connected scholars using DFS. Once we have explored all scholars in a connected component, we move on to the next unvisited scholar and repeat the process. The number of connected components will give us the number of densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nLet's perform the DFS:\n\nDFS(Amir):\n- Mark Amir as visited\n- Explore Wim\n  - Mark Wim as visited\n  - Explore Raj\n    - Mark Raj as visited\n    - Explore Jing\n      - Mark Jing as visited\n      - Explore Pam\n        - Mark Pam as visited\n        - No more unvisited neighbors\n      - No more unvisited neighbors\n    - Explore Wei\n      - Mark Wei as visited\n      - Explore Nisha\n        - Mark Nisha as visited\n        - Explore Sara\n          - Mark Sara as visited\n          - No more unvisited neighbors\n        - No more unvisited neighbors\n      - Explore Reza\n        - Mark Reza as visited\n        - No more unvisited neighbors\n      - Explore Kim\n        - Mark Kim as visited\n        - Explore Moin\n          - Mark Moin as visited\n          - No more unvisited neighbors\n        - No more unvisited neighbors\n      - No more unvisited neighbors\n    - No more unvisited neighbors\n  - Explore Eva\n    - Mark Eva as visited\n    - No more unvisited neighbors\n  - No more unvisited neighbors\n- No more unvisited neighbors\n\nDFS(Ian):\n- Mark Ian as visited\n- Explore Moin\n  - Moin is already visited\n  - No more unvisited neighbors\n- Explore Puja\n  - Mark Puja as visited\n  - Explore Pari\n    - Mark Pari as visited\n    - Explore Pam\n      - Pam is already visited\n      - No more unvisited neighbors\n    - Explore Matt\n      - Mark Matt as visited\n      - No more unvisited neighbors\n    - Explore Eva\n      - Eva is already visited\n      - No more unvisited neighbors\n    - No more unvisited neighbors\n  - Explore Sara\n    - Sara is already visited\n    - No more unvisited neighbors\n  - Explore Moin\n    - Moin is already visited\n    - No more unvisited neighbors\n  - No more unvisited neighbors\n- No more unvisited neighbors\n\nAfter performing the DFS, we have visited all scholars and identified the following densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin\nCluster 3: Ian, Puja, Pari, Matt, Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
