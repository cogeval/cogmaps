Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency matrix to represent the connections between scholars:\n\n```\nAmir:  Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim:   Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj:   Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing:  Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei:   Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza:  Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim:   Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan:   Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin:  Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja:  Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara:  Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari:  Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam:   Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt:  Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva:   Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n```\n\nNow, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to find the connected components. We start with an unvisited scholar and perform DFS to explore all connected scholars. Each time we finish exploring a connected component, we increment the cluster count.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Start with an empty set of visited scholars and a cluster count of 0.\n2. Iterate through each scholar in the group.\n3. For each unvisited scholar, perform a DFS to find all connected scholars.\n4. Increment the cluster count by 1.\n5. Mark all visited scholars as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all scholars have been visited.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the final outcome is:\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
