First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between scholars. Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between scholars will be represented as edges between nodes.\n\n2. Next, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) traversal to identify the connected components in the graph. For each traversal, we start from a scholar and explore all the connected scholars. We mark each visited scholar to avoid visiting them again.\n\n3. Count the number of connected components found during the traversal. A connected component is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves.\n\n4. Finally, return the number of densely-connected clusters found.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given group of scholars:\n\n1. Create a graph representation based on the connections between scholars:\n   - Amir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n   - Wim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n   - Raj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n   - Jing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n   - Wei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n   - Nisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n   - Reza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n   - Kim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n   - Ian -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n   - Moin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n   - Puja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n   - Sara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n   - Pari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n   - Pam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n   - Matt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n   - Eva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\n2. Perform a DFS or BFS traversal starting from each scholar to find the connected components:\n   - Starting from Amir: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva\n   - Starting from Wim: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva\n   - Starting from Raj: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara\n   - Starting from Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin\n   - Starting from Wei: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin\n   - Starting from Nisha: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Sara\n   - Starting from Reza: Amir, Reza, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n   - Starting from Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin\n   - Starting from Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Ian, Matt, Eva\n   - Starting from Moin: Ian, Moin, Puja, Kim, Sara\n   - Starting from Puja: Pari, Ian, Puja, Sara, Moin, Kim\n   - Starting from Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Nisha\n   - Starting from Pari: Pari, Pam, Jing, Matt, Eva\n   - Starting from Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva, Pam\n   - Starting from Matt: Ian, Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva\n   - Starting from Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva, Wim\n\n3.
