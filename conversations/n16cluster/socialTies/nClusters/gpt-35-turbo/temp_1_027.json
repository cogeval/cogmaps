Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar will represent a node, and the connections between scholars will represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's represent the connections between scholars in a graph:\n\n- Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n- Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n- Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n- Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n- Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n- Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n- Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n- Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n- Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n- Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n- Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n- Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n- Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n- Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n- Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n- Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can identify the clusters by finding the connected components in this graph.\n\nStart with an empty list of clusters.\nFor each scholar in the group:\n- If the scholar is not already assigned to a cluster, create a new cluster and add the scholar to it.\n- Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n- For each connected scholar found during the DFS, add it to the current cluster and mark it as visited.\n- Repeat the above steps for all unvisited scholars in the group.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with an empty list of clusters.\n2. Select the first unvisited scholar, Amir.\n3. Create a new cluster and add Amir to it.\n4. Perform a DFS starting from Amir:\n    - Visit Wim, add it to the cluster.\n    - Visit Raj, add it to the cluster.\n    - Visit Jing, add it to the cluster.\n    - Visit Reza, add it to the cluster.\n5. Mark Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza as visited.\n6. Add the cluster containing Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to the list of clusters.\n7. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Wei, and repeat steps 3-6.\n8. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Nisha, and repeat steps 3-6.\n9. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Kim, and repeat steps 3-6.\n10. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Ian, and repeat steps 3-6.\n11. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Moin, and repeat steps 3-6.\n12. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Puja, and repeat steps 3-6.\n13. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Sara, and repeat steps 3-6.\n14. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Pari, and repeat steps 3-6.\n15. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Pam, and repeat steps 3-6.\n16. Continue to the next unvisited scholar, Matt, and repeat steps 3-6.\n17. Finally, continue to the last unvisited scholar, Eva, and repeat steps 3-6.\n\nAfter completing these steps, we will have a list of all the clusters. We can count the number of clusters to get the final answer.\n\nAnswer: there are 7 clusters."
