Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We can represent the scholars as nodes and their connections as edges in a graph.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n- Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n- Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n- Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n- Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n- Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n- Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n- Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n- Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\n2. Identify the densely-connected clusters using graph traversal algorithms:\n\nWe can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to traverse the graph and identify the clusters.\n\nStarting with Amir, we can perform a DFS or BFS to find all the scholars connected to Amir. This will give us the first densely-connected cluster: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Eva, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara, Pari, Pam, Matt.\n\nNext, we can continue the traversal from any remaining unvisited scholar and find another densely-connected cluster: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Nisha, Kim.\n\nSince there are no remaining unvisited scholars, we have found all the densely-connected clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: There are 2 clusters."
