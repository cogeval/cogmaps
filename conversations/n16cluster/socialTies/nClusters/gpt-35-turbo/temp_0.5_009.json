Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nWe can start by creating an adjacency list to represent the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each scholar to find the connected components.\n\nStarting from each scholar, we can mark the visited scholars and add them to a cluster. If a scholar is already visited, we skip it. We repeat this process for all scholars until we have visited all scholars.\n\nAfter performing the DFS or BFS for all scholars, we will have a list of clusters. We can count the clusters that have a minimum of 2 scholars to find the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nLet's perform the DFS to find the clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
