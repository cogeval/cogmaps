A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

First, we need to represent the scholars and their connections as a graph. Each scholar will be a vertex, and the connections between scholars will be represented by edges.\n\n2. We can start by initializing an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n\n3. For each scholar in the group, if they haven't been visited already, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the scholars connected to them. We can use a recursive approach to implement DFS.\n\n4. During the DFS, we will mark each visited scholar as visited and add them to the set of visited scholars.\n\n5. After completing the DFS for a particular scholar, we will have found all the scholars in the connected component they belong to.\n\n6. We can repeat steps 3 to 5 for all scholars in the group, ensuring that we only perform DFS for scholars who haven't been visited already.\n\n7. The number of completed DFS calls will give us the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: there are [7] clusters."
