First, we can represent the scholars and their connections as a graph where each scholar is a node and each connection is an edge between two nodes.\n2. Then, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find all the connected components.\n3. A connected component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other by one or more paths.\n4. To identify densely-connected clusters, we can count the number of nodes in each connected component and only consider those with at least two nodes.\n\nUsing this approach, we can identify 4 densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza\n\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Kim, Reza, and Moin\n\nCluster 3: Ian, Puja, Sara, and Matt\n\nCluster 4: Pam, Pari, and Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
