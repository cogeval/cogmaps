Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."
