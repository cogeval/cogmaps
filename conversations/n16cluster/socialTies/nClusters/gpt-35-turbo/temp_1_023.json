            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected clusters of scholars in this group, we can use the concept of connected components. We will iterate through each scholar and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the scholars connected to them. If we encounter a scholar that has already been visited, we will skip that iteration. After performing DFS for all scholars, we will count the number of iterations to determine the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n2. Initialize a variable `cluster_count` to 0 to count the number of clusters.\n3. Iterate through each scholar in the group:\n   1. If the scholar is already visited, skip to the next iteration.\n   2. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the current scholar:\n      1. Create an empty stack to store scholars to visit.\n      2. Push the current scholar onto the stack.\n      3. While the stack is not empty:\n         1. Pop a scholar from the stack.\n         2. Mark the scholar as visited by adding them to the visited set.\n         3. Iterate through each scholar connected to the current scholar:\n            1. If the connected scholar is not visited, push them onto the stack.\n   3. Increment `cluster_count` by 1.\n4. The value of `cluster_count` represents the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
