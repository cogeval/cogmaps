Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir - Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n2. Wim - Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n3. Raj - Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n4. Jing - Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n5. Wei - Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n6. Nisha - Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n7. Reza - Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n8. Kim - Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n9. Ian - Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n10. Moin - Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n11. Puja - Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n12. Sara - Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n13. Pari - Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n14. Pam - Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n15. Matt - Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n16. Eva - Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can identify the connected components in this graph using depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithms.\n\nStarting with Amir as the first scholar, we can traverse the graph to find the connected components. We can keep track of visited scholars to avoid revisiting them.\n\nBy performing the traversal, we can identify the following clusters:\n\n1. Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n2. Wei, Nisha, Kim\n3. Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n4. Pari, Pam, Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
