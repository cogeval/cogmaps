Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\nBased on the given information, we can construct the following graph:\n\nAmir - Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim - Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj - Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing - Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei - Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha - Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza - Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim - Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan - Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin - Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja - Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara - Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari - Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam - Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt - Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva - Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can identify the densely-connected clusters by finding the connected components in this graph. A connected component is a subgraph where every node is connected to every other node in the subgraph.\n\nBy analyzing the graph, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nCluster 2: Wei, Nisha, Kim, Reza\nCluster 3: Ian, Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nCluster 4: Pari, Pam, Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
