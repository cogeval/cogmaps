Each scholar can be considered as a node in the graph, and their connections can be represented as edges between the nodes.\n\nFirst, let's list down all the connections:\n\n- Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n- Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n- Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n- Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n- Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n- Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n- Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n- Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n- Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n- Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n- Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n- Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n- Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n- Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n- Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n- Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected clusters by traversing the graph.\n\n1. Start with Amir:\n   - Amir -> Wim -> Raj -> Jing -> Amir (forming a cycle)\n\n2. Next, move to Reza:\n   - Reza -> Amir -> Wim -> Reza (forming a cycle)\n   - Reza -> Nisha -> Wei -> Raj -> Jing -> Pam -> Eva -> Wim -> Reza (forming a cycle)\n   - Reza -> Kim -> Wei -> Reza (forming a cycle)\n\n3. Then, proceed with Moin:\n   - Moin -> Ian -> Moin (forming a cycle)\n   - Moin -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara -> Moin (forming a cycle)\n\n4. Lastly, consider Ian:\n   - Ian -> Moin -> Ian (forming a cycle)\n   - Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Eva -> Wim -> Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian (forming a cycle)\n   - Ian -> Sara -> Nisha -> Wei -> Raj -> Jing -> Pam -> Matt -> Pari -> Ian (forming a cycle)\n\nBased on the above analysis, we have identified four densely-connected clusters:\n- Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing\n- Reza, Nisha, Wei, Kim\n- Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara\n- Matt, Pari, Pam, Eva\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
