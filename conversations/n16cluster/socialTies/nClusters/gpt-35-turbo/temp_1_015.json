            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected clusters of scholars in this group, we can use the concept of connected components in a graph. Each scholar will represent a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars will represent edges.\n\nFirst, we need to create an adjacency matrix to represent the connections between scholars. The matrix will be a 16x16 matrix, where each cell will be a 1 if there is a connection between the corresponding scholars and 0 otherwise.\n\nNext, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on the graph to find the connected components. Starting from each scholar, we will explore all their connections recursively, marking the visited scholars as we go.\n\nAfter performing DFS on all scholars, the number of connected components will be the number of densely-connected clusters in the group.\n\nLet's calculate the number of clusters step by step:\n\n1. Create an adjacency matrix:\n   - Initialize a 16x16 matrix with all cells set to 0.\n   - Based on the given connections, set the corresponding cells to 1.\n\n2. Perform a depth-first search:\n   - Initialize a list of visited scholars.\n   - For each scholar, if the scholar has not been visited, perform a DFS starting from that scholar:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Explore all the connections of the scholar recursively.\n   - Count the number of DFS performed. This will be the number of clusters.\n\n3. Return the number of clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 9 clusters."
