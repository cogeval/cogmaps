Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency matrix to represent the connections between scholars:\n\n```\n        Amir Wim Raj Jing Wei Nisha Reza Kim Ian Moin Puja Sara Pari Pam Matt Eva\nAmir     0   1   1   1   0     0    1   0   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nWim      1   0   1   1   0     0    0   0   0    0    0    0    0   0    1   1\nRaj      1   1   0   1   1     0    0   0   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nJing     1   1   1   0   0     0    0   0   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nWei      0   0   1   0   0     1    1   1   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nNisha    0   0   0   0   1     0    1   1   0    0    1    0    0   0    0   0\nReza     1   0   0   0   1     1    0   1   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nKim      0   0   1   0   1     1    1   0   0    0    0    0    0   0    0   0\nIan      0   0   0   0   0     0    0   0   0    1    1    1    0   0    0   0\nMoin     0   0   0   0   0     0    0   1   1    0    1    1    0   0    0   0\nPuja     0   0   0   0   0     0    0   0   1    1    0    1    0   0    0   0\nSara     0   0   0   0   0     1    0   0   1    1    0    0    0   0    0   0\nPari     0   0   0   0   0     0    0   0   0    1    0    0    1   1    1   1\nPam      0   0   0   1   0     0    0   0   0    0    0    0    1   0    1   1\nMatt     0   0   0   0   0     0    0   0   1    0    0    0    1   1    0   1\nEva      0   1   0   0   0     0    0   0   0    0    0    0    1   1    1   0\n```\n\nNext, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to identify the connected components in the graph. Each time we encounter a new node during the search, we can increment a counter to keep track of the number of clusters.\n\nPerforming a DFS or BFS on this graph, we find that there are 3 densely-connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
