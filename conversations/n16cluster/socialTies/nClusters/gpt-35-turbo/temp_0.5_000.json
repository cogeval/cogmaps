A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the subset. \n\nFirst, we can represent the connections between the socialites as a graph. Each socialite can be represented as a vertex, and the connections between them can be represented as edges. \n\nUsing this graph, we can identify the following cliques: \n\n- Paul, Bob, Nick, Sherry \n- Amanda, Daisy, John, Peter \n- Maggie, Adam, Alisha, Jennifer \n- Andrew, Russell, William, Rose \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
