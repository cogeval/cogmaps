Each scholar can be represented as a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars can be represented as edges.\n\nLet's start by representing the connections between scholars in the form of a graph:\n\n- Amir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n- Wim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n- Raj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n- Jing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n- Wei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n- Nisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n- Reza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n- Kim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n- Ian -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n- Moin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n- Puja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n- Sara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n- Pari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n- Pam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n- Matt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n- Eva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each scholar and count the number of connected components.\n\nStarting from each scholar, we can mark them as visited and explore their connections recursively. If a connection is already visited, we skip it to avoid cycles. Once we have explored all the connections for a scholar, we increment the count of clusters by 1.\n\nLet's perform this process step by step:\n\n1. Start with Amir: Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara -> Kim -> Reza -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Pam -> Jing -> Matt.
