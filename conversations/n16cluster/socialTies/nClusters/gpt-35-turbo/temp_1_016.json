Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. How many densely-connected clusters of scholars are there in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between them will be represented as edges.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\nAmir -- Wim -- Raj -- Jing -- Pam -- Pari -- Matt -- Ian -- Puja -- Moin -- Kim -- Nisha -- Reza -- Eva -- Sara -- Wei\n\nNow, we can start identifying the densely-connected clusters in this graph. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph and find all the clusters.\n\nStarting from a node, we will perform a DFS traversal to find all the connected nodes. If we encounter a node that has already been visited, we will stop the DFS traversal for that particular branch. We will continue this process until we have visited all the nodes in the graph.\n\nLet's perform the DFS traversal:\n\nStarting from Amir:\n- Amir -> Wim -> Raj -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Eva (Cycle completes at Eva)\n\nStarting from Nisha:\n- Nisha -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Sara (Cycle completes at Sara)\n\nStarting from Reza:\n- Reza -> Wei -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Ian -> Puja -> Sara (Cycle completes at Sara)\n\nWe have found three clusters:\n\n1. Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, Eva (Cycle completes at Eva)\n2. Cluster 2: Nisha, Wei, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara (Cycle completes at Sara)\n3. Cluster 3: Reza, Wei, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara (Cycle completes at Sara)\n\nAnswer: There are 3 clusters."
