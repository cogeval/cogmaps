Start with Ian as the initial node and create an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Ian into the queue.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, mark the dequeued node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors into the queue.\n5.
