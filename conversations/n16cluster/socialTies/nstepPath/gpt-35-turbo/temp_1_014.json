Start with Pam as the initial node and create an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Pam into the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Nisha, the shortest path has been found. Stop the algorithm and output the path.\n   - Otherwise, add the dequeued scholar to the visited set.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited before.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Nisha has not been found, there is no path from Pam to Nisha.\n\nLet's now apply the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from Pam to Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha"
