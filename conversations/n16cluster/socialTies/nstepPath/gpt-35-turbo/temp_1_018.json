Initialize a queue to store the scholars and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Enqueue Kim (scholar number 8) to the queue and mark Kim as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   2. If the dequeued scholar is Eva (scholar number 15), we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the list of visited scholars.\n   3. Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars (neighbors) of the dequeued scholar who have not been visited yet, and mark them as visited.\n4.
