If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Moin.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Check if any of these scholars are connected to Moin. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, followed by the scholar connected to Moin.\n5. If not, check the connections of the scholars connected to Jing (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Moin is found.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Jing to Moin is:\n\nJing, Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
