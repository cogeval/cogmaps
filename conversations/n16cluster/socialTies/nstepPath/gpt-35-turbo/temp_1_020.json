We will create a queue to keep track of the scholars we need to visit next and a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited. We will start with Sara and add her to the queue and visited set.\n\n1. Initialize the queue and visited set.\n   - Queue: [Sara]\n   - Visited: {Sara}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n\n3. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n\n4. Check if the dequeued scholar is Wim. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Return the list of scholars visited in order.\n\n5. If the dequeued scholar is not Wim, check their connections. Add any unvisited connected scholars to the queue and visited set.\n\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until Wim is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Sara to Wim.\n\nAnswer: Sara, Ian, Wim"
