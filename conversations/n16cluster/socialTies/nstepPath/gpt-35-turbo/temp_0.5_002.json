Create a queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty list to store the path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the node is Sara, we have found the shortest path. Add Sara to the path list and break the loop.\n   - If the node has not been visited:\n     - Mark the node as visited.\n     - Add the node to the path list.\n     - Enqueue all the neighbors of the node that have not been visited.\n6. Finally, the path list will contain the shortest path from Wim to Sara.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given information:\n\n1. Start with Wim as the initial node.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Mark Wim as visited.\n4. Add Wim to the path list.\n5. Enqueue Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva (Wim's neighbors).\n6. Dequeue Amir.\n   - Mark Amir as visited.\n   - Add Amir to the path list.\n   - Enqueue Raj, Jing, and Reza (Amir's neighbors).\n7. Dequeue Raj.\n   - Mark Raj as visited.\n   - Add Raj to the path list.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei (Raj's neighbors).\n8. Dequeue Jing.\n   - Mark Jing as visited.\n   - Add Jing to the path list.\n   - Enqueue Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam (Jing's neighbors).\n9. Dequeue Eva.\n   - Mark Eva as visited.\n   - Add Eva to the path list.\n   - Enqueue Wim (Eva's neighbor).\n10. Dequeue Reza.\n    - Mark Reza as visited.\n    - Add Reza to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei (Reza's neighbors).\n11. Dequeue Pam.\n    - Mark Pam as visited.\n    - Add Pam to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva (Pam's neighbors).\n12. Dequeue Wei.\n    - Mark Wei as visited.\n    - Add Wei to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj (Wei's neighbors).\n13. Dequeue Nisha.\n    - Mark Nisha as visited.\n    - Add Nisha to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara (Nisha's neighbors).\n14. Dequeue Kim.\n    - Mark Kim as visited.\n    - Add Kim to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin (Kim's neighbors).\n15. Dequeue Ian.\n    - Mark Ian as visited.\n    - Add Ian to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt (Ian's neighbors).\n16. Dequeue Moin.\n    - Mark Moin as visited.\n    - Add Moin to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara (Moin's neighbors).\n17. Dequeue Puja.\n    - Mark Puja as visited.\n    - Add Puja to the path list.\n    - Enqueue Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin (Puja's neighbors).\n18. Dequeue Sara.\n    - Mark Sara as visited.\n    - Add Sara to the path list.\n    - Break the loop.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Sara is: Wim, Eva, Pam, Pari, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Eva, Pam, Pari, Sara."
