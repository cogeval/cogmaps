Starting with Nisha, we check if Nisha is connected to Pam. If yes, then the shortest path is just Nisha and Pam.\n\n2. If Nisha is not directly connected to Pam, we need to explore Nisha's connections. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n\n3. Since Wei is not connected to Pam, we exclude Wei from our search.\n\n4. We add Reza, Kim, and Sara to the search list. The current search list is Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n\n5.
