We'll also create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars and a dictionary to store the paths from Reza to each scholar. We'll initialize the dictionary with Reza as the starting point.\n\n1. Initialize a queue, visited set, and path dictionary.\n    - Queue: [Reza]\n    - Visited set: {Reza}\n    - Path dictionary: {Reza: [Reza]}\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, continue the following steps:\n    - Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n        - Queue: []\n        - Current scholar: Reza\n\n    - If the current scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path.\n        - Path: [Reza, Pari]\n        - Exit the loop.\n\n    - For each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n        - Connected scholars: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n        - Updated queue: [Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei]\n        - Updated visited set: {Reza, Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei}\n\n    - Update the path dictionary with the current scholar as the key and the path from Reza to the current scholar as the value.\n        - Updated path dictionary: {Reza: [Reza], Amir: [Reza, Amir], Kim: [Reza, Kim], Nisha: [Reza, Nisha], Wei: [Reza, Wei]}\n\n3.
