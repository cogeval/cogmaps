We start at Wei and traverse the graph until we reach Matt.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at Wei.\n2. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n3. Add Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Nisha.\n5. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n7. Add Reza, Kim, and Sara to the queue.\n8. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n9. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n10. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n11. Add Amir, Kim, and Nisha to the queue.\n12. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Kim.\n13. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n14. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n15. Add Nisha, Reza, and Moin to the queue.\n16. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Nisha.\n17. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n18. Add Reza and Moin to the queue.\n19. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n20. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n21. Since Wei is already visited, we skip it.\n22. Add Amir, Kim, and Nisha to the queue.\n23. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Amir.\n24. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n25. Since Matt is not in Amir's connections, we skip it.\n26. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Kim.\n27. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n28. Since Matt is not in Kim's connections, we skip it.\n29. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Nisha.\n30. Since Matt is not in Nisha's connections, we skip it.\n31. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Raj.\n32. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n33. Since Matt is not in Raj's connections, we skip it.\n34. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Reza.\n35. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n36. Since Matt is not in Reza's connections, we skip it.\n37. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Moin.\n38. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n39. Since Matt is not in Moin's connections, we skip it.\n40. The queue is empty, and we have not found Matt yet.\n41. We have checked all reachable scholars from Wei, and Matt is not found.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Wei to Matt in the given group of scholars."
