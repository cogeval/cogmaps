Check if Moin is connected to Wim directly. If so, the shortest path is just Moin and Wim.\n3. If not, check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n4. Check Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara. We have already visited Moin, so we can skip it.\n5. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. We have already visited Moin, so we can skip it.\n6. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. We have already visited Moin, so we can skip it.\n7. Check Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. We have already visited Moin, so we can skip it.\n8. No new connections are found, so we backtrack to the previous step.\n9. Backtracking to Puja, we check Puja's remaining connections: Pari, Ian, and Sara. We have already visited Ian and Sara, so we can skip them.\n10. Check Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. We have already visited Puja, so we can skip it.\n11. Check Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. We have already visited Ian, so we can skip it.\n12. Check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. We have reached Wim, so the shortest path from Moin to Wim is Moin, Puja, Pari, Eva, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Puja, Pari, Eva, Wim"
