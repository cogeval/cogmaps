Start with Amir as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Puja. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and Puja is not found, there is no path from Amir to Puja.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Puja"
