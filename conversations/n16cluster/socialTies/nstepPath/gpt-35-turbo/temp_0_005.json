Create an empty queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Ian, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If Ian is not found, there is no path from Raj to Ian.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Ian:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Ian"
