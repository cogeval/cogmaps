Check if Jing is connected to Kim. If yes, the path is Pam, Jing, Kim.\n7. If not, check Jing's connections (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam). Since Pam is already in the path, we skip it to avoid loops.\n8. Add Amir, Wim, and Raj to the queue.\n9. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n10. Check if Amir is connected to Kim. If yes, the path is Pam, Jing, Amir, Kim.\n11. If not, check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza). Since Jing is already in the path, we skip it to avoid loops.\n12. Add Wim and Raj to the queue.\n13.
