If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Nisha.\n3. If not, check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n4. Check if any of Pam's connections are directly connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, followed by the connection to Nisha.\n5. If not, check the connections of Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n6. Repeat this process until Nisha is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's find the shortest path from Pam to Nisha:\n\n1. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n2. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Nisha is not directly connected to Jing.\n3. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Nisha is not directly connected to Pari.\n4. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Nisha is not directly connected to Matt.\n5. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Nisha is not directly connected to Eva.\n6. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Nisha is directly connected to Puja.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pam to Nisha is: Pam, Puja, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Puja, Nisha"
