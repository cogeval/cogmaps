Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Jing, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from Moin to Jing.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Moin to Jing:\n\nAnswer: 11, 9, 4, 3"
