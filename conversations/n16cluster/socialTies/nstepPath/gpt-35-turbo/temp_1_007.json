Check if Jing is directly connected to Moin. If yes, then the shortest path is just Jing and Moin. \n   Answer: Jing, Moin.\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Moin, check Jing's connections:\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n4. Continue with each connection of Jing one by one:\n   - From Jing to Amir: Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n     - Since Amir is directly connected to Moin through Moin's connection with Kim, the shortest path is: \n       Answer: Jing, Amir, Moin.\n   - From Jing to Wim: Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n     - Since Wim is directly connected to Moin through Moin's connection with Kim, the shortest path is: \n       Answer: Jing, Wim, Moin.\n   - From Jing to Raj: Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n     - Since Raj is directly connected to Moin through Moin's connection with Kim, the shortest path is: \n       Answer: Jing, Raj, Moin.\n   - From Jing to Pam: Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n     - Since Pam is directly connected to Moin through Moin's connection with Ian, the shortest path is: \n       Answer: Jing, Pam, Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Jing to Moin is: Jing, Raj, Moin.\n"
