If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Eva.\n3. If not, check if Kim is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Kim, the scholar connected to Kim, and Eva.\n4. If not, check if Kim is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Eva. Repeat this step until a connection is found.\n5. If no connection is found, there is no path from Kim to Eva.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Eva.\n3. Wei is connected to Eva, so the shortest path from Kim to Eva is Kim, Wei, and Eva.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Wei, Eva"
