If yes, the shortest path is Sara, Jing.\n3. If not, check Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n4. Check if any of Sara's connections are connected to Jing. If yes, the shortest path is Sara, the connection, Jing.\n5. If not, check the connections of Sara's connections: Ian's connections are Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Moin's connections are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja's connections are Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Nisha's connections are Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Repeat step 4 for each connection and their connections until Jing is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Sara to Jing is:\n\nSara, Ian, Moin, Kim, Jing\n\nAnswer: Sara, Ian, Moin, Kim, Jing"
