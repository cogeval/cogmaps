If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Pam.\n3. If not, check Kim's connections (Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin).\n4. Check if any of Kim's connections are directly connected to Pam. If yes, the shortest path is Kim, followed by the connection to Pam.\n5. If not, check the connections of Kim's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Pam is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n2. None of Kim's connections are directly connected to Pam.\n3. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n4. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n5. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n6. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n8.
