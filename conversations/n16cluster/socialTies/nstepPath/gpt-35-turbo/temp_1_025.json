Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n3. Check if any of them are Amir. Since Amir is not one of the connections from Ian, we need to explore further.\n4. Ian is directly connected to Moin, so add Moin to the queue.\n5. Remove Ian from the queue.\n6. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Check if any of them are Amir. Amir is not one of Moin's connections, so continue.\n8. Moin is directly connected to Kim, so add Kim to the queue.\n9. Moin is directly connected to Puja, so add Puja to the queue.\n10. Moin is directly connected to Sara, so add Sara to the queue.\n11. Remove Moin from the queue.\n12. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n13. Check if any of them are Amir. Amir is not one of Kim's connections, so continue.\n14. Kim is directly connected to Wei, so add Wei to the queue.\n15. Kim is directly connected to Nisha, so add Nisha to the queue.\n16. Kim is directly connected to Reza, so add Reza to the queue.\n17. Kim is directly connected to Moin, but Moin is already in the queue, so skip.\n18. Remove Kim from the queue.\n19. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n20. Check if any of them are Amir. Amir is not one of Puja's connections, so continue.\n21. Puja is directly connected to Ian, but Ian is already in the queue, so skip.\n22. Puja is directly connected to Sara, but Sara is already in the queue, so skip.\n23. Puja is directly connected to Moin, but Moin is already in the queue, so skip.\n24. Remove Puja from the queue.\n25. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n26. Check if any of them are Amir. Amir is not one of Sara's connections, so continue.\n27. Sara is directly connected to Ian, but Ian is already in the queue, so skip.\n28. Sara is directly connected to Moin, but Moin is already in the queue, so skip.\n29. Sara is directly connected to Puja, but Puja is already in the queue, so skip.\n30. Sara is directly connected to Nisha, so add Nisha to the queue.\n31. Remove Sara from the queue.\n32. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n33. Check if any of them are Amir. Amir is not one of Nisha's connections, so continue.\n34. Nisha is directly connected to Wei, but Wei is already in the queue, so skip.\n35. Nisha is directly connected to Reza, but Reza is already in the queue, so skip.\n36. Nisha is directly connected to Kim, but Kim is already in the queue, so skip.\n37. Remove Nisha from the queue.\n38. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Finally, Amir is found!\n39. The shortest path from Ian to Amir is: Ian, Moin, Kim, Reza, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Ian, Moin, Kim, Reza, Amir"
