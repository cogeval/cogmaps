Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n2. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Since Raj is already connected to Nisha, we skip this connection.\n3. Reza is connected to Nisha, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Since Nisha and Wei are already connected, we skip these connections.\n4. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Since Nisha and Reza are already connected, we skip these connections.\n5. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Since Nisha is already connected, we skip this connection.\n6. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Since Kim and Sara are already connected, we skip these connections.\n7. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Since Sara and Moin are already connected, we skip these connections.\n8. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Since Eva is already connected, we have found the shortest path.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Nisha to Eva is: Nisha, Puja, Pari, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Puja, Pari, Eva."
