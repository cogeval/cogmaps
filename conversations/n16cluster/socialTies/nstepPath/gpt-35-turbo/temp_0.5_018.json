If yes, the shortest path is just Kim and Eva.\n3. If not, check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n4. Check if any of Kim's connections are connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Kim, followed by the connection that leads to Eva, and then Eva.\n5. If not, check the connections of Kim's connections:\n   - For Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - For Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Repeat step 4 for each of these connections until Eva is found.\n7. If Eva is not found, continue expanding the connections until all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's find the shortest path from Kim to Eva:\n\nKim -> Wei -> Raj -> Eva\n\nAnswer: Kim, Wei, Raj, Eva"
