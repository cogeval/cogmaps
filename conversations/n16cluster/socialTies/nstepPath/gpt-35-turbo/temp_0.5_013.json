Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n3. Add Wei and its connections to the queue: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue: Wei.\n5. Check if Wei is Matt. If yes, we have found the shortest path. If not, continue to the next step.\n6. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n7. Add Wei's connections that are not already in the queue to the end of the queue: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until Matt is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Wei to Matt:\n\nQueue: Wei\nVisited: (empty)\n\n1. Take the first scholar from the queue: Wei.\n   Queue: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n   Visited: Wei\n\n2.
