Start with Raj as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Puja. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found Puja, it means there is no path from Raj to Puja.\n\nApplying these steps to the given information:\n\nStarting with Raj, the scholars connected to Raj are Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. We will enqueue these scholars in the order mentioned.\n\nNext, we dequeue Amir and check if it is Puja. Since it is not, we enqueue the scholars connected to Amir, which are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n\nWe continue this process, enqueueing and dequeuing scholars until we find Puja or the queue becomes empty.\n\nLet's start with the implementation.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Amir, Puja"
