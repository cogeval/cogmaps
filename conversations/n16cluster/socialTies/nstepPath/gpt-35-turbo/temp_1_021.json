Start with Sara and enqueue her as the initial node in the BFS queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the front node from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued node is Jing, we have found the shortest path. Stop the search.\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all the neighbors of the dequeued node that haven't been visited yet.\n3. If we reach this step, it means there is no path from Sara to Jing.\n\nNow, let's go through these steps and find the shortest path from Sara to Jing:\n\nAnswer: Sara, Nisha, Wei, Raj, Jing"
