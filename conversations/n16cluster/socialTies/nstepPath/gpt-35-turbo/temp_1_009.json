Start with Reza (scholar number 9) as the initial node.\n2. Check Reza's connections: Amir (1), Kim (10), Nisha (11), and Wei (8).\n3. From the connections of Reza, we ignore Amir as he is already visited, and we add Kim, Nisha, and Wei to the queue.\n4. Next, we dequeue Wei (scholar number 8) and check his connections: Nisha (11), Reza (9), Kim (10), and Raj (4). We ignore Nisha as she is already visited and add Raj to the queue.\n5. Continuing this process, we dequeue Raj (scholar number 4) and check his connections: Amir (1), Wim (2), Jing (3), and Wei (8). We ignore Amir, Wim, and Jing as they are already visited.\n6. Then, we dequeue Kim (scholar number 10) and check his connections: Wei (8), Nisha (11), Reza (9), and Moin (7). We ignore Wei, Nisha, and Reza as they are already visited. We add Moin to the queue.\n7. Now, we dequeue Moin (scholar number 7) and check his connections: Ian (13), Puja (14), Kim (10), and Sara (12). We ignore Ian, Puja, and Kim as they are already visited. We add Sara to the queue.\n8. Continuing this process, we dequeue Sara (scholar number 12) and check her connections: Ian (13), Moin (7), Puja (14), and Nisha (11). We ignore Ian, Moin, and Puja as they are already visited.\n9. Finally, we dequeue Nisha (scholar number 11) and check her connections: Wei (8), Reza (9), Kim (10), and Sara (12). We ignore Wei, Reza, and Kim as they are already visited.\n10. Now, we dequeue Eva (scholar number 15) and check her connections: Pari (16), Pam (6), Matt (17), and Wim (2). We find Matt (scholar number 17), which is our target.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Kim, Moin, Sara, Matt"
