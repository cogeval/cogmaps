Add Ian to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Raj, the shortest path has been found. Return the list of scholars visited in order.\n   - Otherwise, for each of the scholar's connections that have not been visited yet, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty without finding Raj, there is no path from Ian to Raj.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Ian to Raj:\n\n1. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Add Ian to the queue and mark him as visited.\n2. Remove Ian from the queue.\n3. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Add Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Remove Moin from the queue.\n5. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Add Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara to the queue, but since Ian and Sara have already been visited, they are not added again.\n6. Remove Puja from the queue.\n7. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Add Pari to the queue and mark her as visited.\n8. Remove Kim from the queue.\n9. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Add Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin to the queue, but since Moin has already been visited, he is not added again.\n10. Remove Sara from the queue.\n11. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Since Ian and Moin have already been visited, they are not added again.\n12. Remove Reza from the queue.\n13. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Since Nisha and Wei have already been visited, they are not added again.\n14. Remove Pari from the queue.\n15. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Since Matt and Eva have already been visited, they are not added again.\n16. Remove Nisha from the queue.\n17. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Since Wei and Reza have already been visited, they are not added again.\n18. Remove Pam from the queue.\n19. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Since Pari and Matt have already been visited, they are not added again.\n20. Remove Eva from the queue.\n21. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Since Pari, Pam, and Matt have already been visited, they are not added again.\n22. Remove Wim from the queue.\n23. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Since Amir, Jing, and Eva have already been visited, they are not added again.\n24. Remove Raj from the queue. The shortest path from Ian to Raj has been found.\n\nAnswer: Ian, Moin, Puja, Raj"
