If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Kim.\n3. If not, check Pam's connections (Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva).\n4. Add Pam's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Jing) and check if Jing is connected to Kim. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, Jing, and Kim.\n6. If not, add Jing's connections (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Kim is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Pam is not connected to Kim.\n3. Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n4. Queue: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Jing).\n6.
