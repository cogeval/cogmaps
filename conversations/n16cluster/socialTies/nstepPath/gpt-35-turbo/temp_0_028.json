Create an empty queue and enqueue Matt.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Wei, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Add the neighbor to the path dictionary with the dequeued node as its value.\n6. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from Matt to Wei.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Matt to Wei:\n\nAnswer: Matt, Ian, Moin, Wei"
