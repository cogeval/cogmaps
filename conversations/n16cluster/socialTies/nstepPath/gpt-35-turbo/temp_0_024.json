Create an empty queue and enqueue Ian.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Raj, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If the search completes without finding Raj, there is no path from Ian to Raj.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Ian to Raj:\n\n1. Start with Ian as the initial node.\n2. Enqueue Ian.\n3. Mark Ian as visited.\n4. Set the path from Ian as empty.\n5. Dequeue Ian.\n6. Ian has four neighbors: Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Enqueue Moin.\n   - Enqueue Puja.\n   - Enqueue Kim.\n   - Enqueue Sara.\n   - Set Ian as the parent of Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara in the path dictionary.\n7. Dequeue Moin.\n8. Moin has four neighbors: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Since Ian is already visited, skip Ian.\n   - Enqueue Puja.\n   - Enqueue Kim.\n   - Enqueue Sara.\n   - Set Moin as the parent of Puja, Kim, and Sara in the path dictionary.\n9. Dequeue Puja.\n10. Puja has four neighbors: Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n    - Since Ian is already visited, skip Ian.\n    - Enqueue Pari.\n    - Since Sara is already visited, skip Sara.\n    - Set Puja as the parent of Pari and Moin in the path dictionary.\n11. Dequeue Kim.\n12. Kim has four neighbors: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n    - Enqueue Wei.\n    - Enqueue Nisha.\n    - Enqueue Reza.\n    - Since Moin is already visited, skip Moin.\n    - Set Kim as the parent of Wei, Nisha, and Reza in the path dictionary.\n13. Dequeue Sara.\n14. Sara has four neighbors: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n    - Since Ian is already visited, skip Ian.\n    - Since Moin is already visited, skip Moin.\n    - Since Puja is already visited, skip Puja.\n    - Since Nisha is already visited, skip Nisha.\n15. Dequeue Wei.\n16. Wei has four neighbors: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n    - Since Nisha is already visited, skip Nisha.\n    - Since Reza is already visited, skip Reza.\n    - Since Kim is already visited, skip Kim.\n    - Enqueue Raj.\n    - Set Wei as the parent of Raj in the path dictionary.\n17. Raj is found! Stop the search and backtrack the path.\n18. The path from Ian to Raj is: Ian -> Kim -> Wei -> Raj.\n\nAnswer: Ian, Kim, Wei, Raj"
