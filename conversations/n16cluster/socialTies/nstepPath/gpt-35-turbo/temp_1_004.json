Dequeue the first scholar from the queue, which is Raj.\n3. Check if the dequeued scholar is Puja. If yes, the shortest path is found. If not, continue to the next step.\n4. Enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar, excluding those that have already been visited or are already in the queue.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or Puja is found.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Enqueue Raj. Queue: [Raj]\n2. Dequeue Raj. Queue: []\n3. Raj is not Puja.\n4.
