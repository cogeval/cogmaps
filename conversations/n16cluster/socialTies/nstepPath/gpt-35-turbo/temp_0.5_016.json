If yes, the shortest path is just Nisha and Eva. If not, proceed to the next step.\n3. Create a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n4. Enqueue Nisha into the queue.\n5. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars that have been visited.\n6. Add Nisha to the visited set.\n7. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is the path from Nisha to the dequeued scholar, followed by Eva. If not, proceed to the next step.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited yet.\n   - Add the connected scholars to the visited set.\n8. If the queue becomes empty and Eva is not found, there is no path from Nisha to Eva.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Nisha to Eva:\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Wei, Raj, Jing, Eva"
