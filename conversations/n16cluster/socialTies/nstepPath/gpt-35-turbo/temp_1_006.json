Starting from Jing, create an empty queue and add Jing to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each scholar to their previous scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   5. Dequeue the next scholar from the queue.\n   6. If the scholar is Sara, stop the search and reconstruct the path.\n   7. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n      8. Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      9. Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     10. Update the path dictionary to store the previous scholar for the connected scholar.\n11. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from Jing to Sara.\n\nNow let's go through the steps and find the shortest path from Jing to Sara.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Eva, Sara"
