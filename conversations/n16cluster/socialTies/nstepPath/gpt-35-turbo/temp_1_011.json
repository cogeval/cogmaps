Check if Eva is connected to Kim directly. If yes, the shortest path is Eva, Kim.\n3. If Eva is not connected to Kim directly, check the immediate connections of Eva.\n   - Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n4.

If none of the immediate connections of Eva are connected to Kim, we need to explore further connections.\n   - Matt is connected to Ian.\n     - Ian is connected to Moin.\n       - Moin is connected to Kim.\n         - The shortest path from Eva to Kim is Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin, Kim"
