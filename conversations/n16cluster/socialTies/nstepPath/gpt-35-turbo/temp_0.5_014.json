If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Nisha.\n3. If not, check Pam's connections and add them to a queue.\n4. Take the first connection from the queue and check if it is Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, the connection, and Nisha.\n5. If not, add the connection's connections to the end of the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Nisha is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n3. Add Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva to the queue.\n4. Take Jing from the queue.\n5. Jing is not Nisha.\n6. Add Jing's connections (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam) to the end of the queue.\n7. Take Pari from the queue.\n8. Pari is not Nisha.\n9. Add Pari's connections (Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja) to the end of the queue.\n10. Take Matt from the queue.\n11. Matt is not Nisha.\n12. Add Matt's connections (Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian) to the end of the queue.\n13. Take Eva from the queue.\n14. Eva is not Nisha.\n15. Add Eva's connections (Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim) to the end of the queue.\n16. Take Amir from the queue.\n17. Amir is not Nisha.\n18. Add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the end of the queue.\n19. Take Wim from the queue.\n20. Wim is not Nisha.\n21.
