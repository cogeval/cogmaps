Move to the next level and check their connections: Ian's connections are Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n5. Among Ian's connections, Moin is already visited, so we skip it.\n6. Puja is not connected to Wim, so we move on to Kim.\n7. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Among them, Moin is already visited, so we skip it.\n8. Wei is not connected to Wim, so we move on to Nisha.\n9. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Among them, Sara is already visited, so we skip it.\n10. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Among them, Kim and Nisha are already visited, so we skip them.\n11. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.
