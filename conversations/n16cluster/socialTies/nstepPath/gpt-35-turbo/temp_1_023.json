Add Moin to the queue.\n3. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars that have already been visited.\n4. Add Moin to the visited set.\n5. Create a path dictionary to store the shortest path from Moin to each scholar.\n6. Set the path for Moin as an empty list.\n7. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Pop a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the popped scholar is Jing. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the popped scholar that has not been visited yet, do the following steps:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Set the path for the connected scholar as the path for the popped scholar plus the connected scholar.\n8.
