If yes, the shortest path is just Puja and Amir.\n3. If not, check Puja's connections (Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin).\n4. Check if any of Puja's connections are directly connected to Amir. If yes, the shortest path is Puja, the direct connection, and Amir.\n5. If not, check the connections of Puja's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Amir is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Puja.\n2. Puja is not directly connected to Amir.\n3. Puja's connections are Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n4. Check if any of Puja's connections are directly connected to Amir. None of them are.\n5. Check the connections of Puja's connections:\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja (already checked).\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara (already checked).\n\n6. Check the connections of Ian and Sara:\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara (already checked).\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   \n7. Check the connections of Kim and Nisha:\n   - Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin (already checked).\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara (already checked).\n\n8. Check the connections of Wei and Reza:\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei (already checked).\n\n9. Check the connections of Raj:\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei (already checked).\n\n10. Check the connections of Amir:\n    - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza (already checked).\n\nSince Amir has been found, the shortest path from Puja to Amir is: Puja, Ian, Sara, Nisha, Wei, Raj, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Ian, Sara, Nisha, Wei, Raj, Amir"
