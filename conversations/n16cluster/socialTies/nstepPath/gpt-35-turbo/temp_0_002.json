Check if Wim is connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Sara.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n4. Add Wim's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir) and check if Amir is connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Amir, and Sara.\n6. If not, add Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Sara is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Wim is not connected to Sara directly.\n3. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Queue: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Amir).\n6. Amir is not connected to Sara directly.\n7. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n8. Queue: Raj, Jing, Eva, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza.\n9. Take the first scholar from the queue (Raj).\n10.
