Initialize a dictionary to store the distance from the starting point for each scholar.\n4. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited with a distance of 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 6-9.\n6. Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n7. Check if the removed scholar is Ian. If yes, stop the search and retrieve the shortest path.\n8.
