If yes, the shortest path is just Nisha and Eva.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections (Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara).\n4. Add Nisha's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wei).\n6. Check if Wei is connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Wei, and Eva.\n7. If not, add Wei's connections (Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Sara) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Eva is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Nisha.\n2. Nisha is not connected to Eva.\n3. Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n4. Queue: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n5. Take Wei from the queue.\n6. Wei is not connected to Eva.\n7. Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n8. Queue: Reza, Kim, Sara, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n9. Take Reza from the queue.\n10. Reza is not connected to Eva.\n11. Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n12. Queue: Kim, Sara, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Sara, Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n13. Take Kim from the queue.\n14. Kim is not connected to Eva.\n15.
