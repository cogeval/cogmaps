Add Raj to the queue and mark Raj as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Ian, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar (excluding those already visited) and mark them as visited.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Raj to Ian.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with Raj: Queue = [Raj]\n2. Mark Raj as visited: Visited = {Raj}\n3. Dequeue Raj from the queue.\n4. Raj is not Ian, so enqueue the scholars connected to Raj (excluding visited scholars): Queue = [Wim, Jing, Wei]\n5. Mark Wim, Jing, and Wei as visited: Visited = {Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei}\n6. Dequeue Wim from the queue.\n7. Wim is not Ian, so enqueue the scholars connected to Wim (excluding visited scholars): Queue = [Jing, Wei, Amir, Raj]\n8. Mark Amir as visited: Visited = {Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir}\n9. Dequeue Jing from the queue.\n10. Jing is not Ian, so enqueue the scholars connected to Jing (excluding visited scholars): Queue = [Wei, Amir, Raj, Wim, Amir]\n11. Mark Amir as visited (already visited): Visited = {Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir}\n12. Dequeue Wei from the queue.\n13. Wei is not Ian, so enqueue the scholars connected to Wei (excluding visited scholars): Queue = [Amir, Raj, Wim, Amir, Nisha]\n14. Mark Nisha as visited: Visited = {Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir, Nisha}\n15. Dequeue Amir from the queue.\n16. Amir is not Ian, so enqueue the scholars connected to Amir (excluding visited scholars): Queue = [Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza]\n17. Mark Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, and Reza as visited: Visited = {Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Amir, Nisha, Reza}\n18. Dequeue Raj from the queue.\n19. Raj is Ian, so the shortest path from Raj to Ian is [Raj].\n\nAnswer: Raj"
