Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the shortest path.\n5. Set the shortest path from Moin to Moin as [Moin].\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Jing, stop the search and return the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Update the shortest path dictionary by setting the shortest path from the connected scholar to the dequeued scholar plus the connected scholar itself.\n7.
