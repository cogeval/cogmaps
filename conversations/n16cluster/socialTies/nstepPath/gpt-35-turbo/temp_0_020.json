If yes, the shortest path is Sara, the connected scholar, Wim.\n5. If not, check the connections of Sara's connections: Ian's connections are Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Moin's connections are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja's connections are Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Nisha's connections are Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Repeat step 4 for each connection of Sara's connections until Wim is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Sara to Wim is:\n\nSara, Ian, Moin, Kim, Wei, Wim\n\nAnswer: Sara, Ian, Moin, Kim, Wei, Wim"
