If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Sara.\n3. If not, check all the scholars connected to Jing (Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam).\n4. If any of these scholars are connected to Sara, add them to the path and the shortest path is Jing, the scholar, and Sara.\n5. If none of these scholars are connected to Sara, check all the scholars connected to the scholars connected to Jing (excluding Jing itself).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Sara is found or all possible paths have been explored.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Sara:\n\nStarting from Jing, the scholars connected to Jing are Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of them are directly connected to Sara, so we need to continue exploring.\n\nThe scholars connected to Amir are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of them are connected to Sara.\n\nThe scholars connected to Wim are Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Eva is connected to Sara, so the shortest path from Jing to Sara is Jing, Wim, Eva, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wim, Eva, Sara"
