Mark Nisha as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and call it current_scholar.\n   - If current_scholar is Pam, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to current_scholar that has not been visited yet, do the following:\n     - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Update the path from Nisha to the connected scholar by adding the connected scholar to the path of current_scholar.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Nisha to Pam.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given group of scholars:\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Wei, Raj, Jing, Pam"
