While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 3-5.\n3. Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current scholar.\n4. Check if the current scholar is Wei. If yes, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n5. If the current scholar is not Wei, add all the scholars connected to the current scholar (excluding those already visited) to the queue.\n6. If the queue becomes empty and Wei is not found, it means there is no path from Matt to Wei.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Matt to Wei:\n\nAnswer: Matt, Ian, Moin, Wei"
