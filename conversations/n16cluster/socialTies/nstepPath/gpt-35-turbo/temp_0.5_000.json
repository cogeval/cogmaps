Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Add Amir and his connections to the queue: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza].\n4. Remove Amir from the queue.\n5. Check the next person in the queue, which is Wim.\n6. Wim's connections are: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n7. Add Wim and his connections to the queue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva].\n8. Remove Wim from the queue.\n9. Continue this process until we find Puja or the queue becomes empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to Puja: Amir, Wim, Eva, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Puja"
