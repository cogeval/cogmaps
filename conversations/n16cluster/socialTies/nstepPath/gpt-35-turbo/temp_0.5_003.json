Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Wim what is the shortest path to Moin? Starting from Wim, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Wim, separated by commas."

Check if Wim is connected to Moin. If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Moin.\n3. If not, check Wim's connections (Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva).\n4. Add these connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first connection from the queue and check if it is Moin. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, the connection, and Moin.\n6. If not, add the connection's connections (excluding Wim and the connections already in the queue) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Moin is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start at Wim.\n2. Wim is not connected to Moin.\n3. Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Add Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva to the queue.\n5. Take Amir from the queue.\n6. Amir is not Moin.\n7. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n8. Add Raj and Jing to the queue (excluding Wim and Amir).\n9. Take Raj from the queue.\n10. Raj is not Moin.\n11. Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n12. Add Jing and Wei to the queue (excluding Wim, Amir, and Raj).\n13. Take Jing from the queue.\n14. Jing is not Moin.\n15. Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n16. Add Pam to the queue (excluding Wim, Amir, Raj, and Jing).\n17. Take Pam from the queue.\n18. Pam is not Moin.\n19. Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n20. Add Pari, Matt, and Eva to the queue (excluding Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, and Pam).\n21. Take Pari from the queue.\n22. Pari is not Moin.\n23. Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n24. Add Matt and Eva to the queue (excluding Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, Pam, and Pari).\n25. Take Matt from the queue.\n26. Matt is not Moin.\n27. Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n28. Add Eva and Ian to the queue (excluding Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, and Matt).\n29. Take Eva from the queue.\n30. Eva is not Moin.\n31. Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n32. Wim is already in the queue, so it is not added again.\n33. The queue is now empty.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Moin is: Wim, Eva, Ian, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Eva, Ian, Moin"
