Add Kim to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n4. Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_scholar\".\n5. If the current_scholar is Pam, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the path.\n6. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current_scholar, check if they have been visited before. If not, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty or Pam is found.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Kim to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Kim, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Pari, Pam"
