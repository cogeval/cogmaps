Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.

            "content": "To find the shortest path from Moin to Wim, we can use the breadth-first search algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start with Moin as the initial node.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Moin.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the path from each node.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Wim, stop the search and backtrack the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the neighbor to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n     - Add the dequeued node as the neighbor's parent in the path dictionary.\n6. If the search completes without finding Wim, there is no path from Moin to Wim.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Moin to Wim:\n\n1. Start with Moin as the initial node.\n2. Enqueue Moin.\n3. Visit Moin and add it to the visited set.\n4. Dequeue Moin.\n5. Moin has the following neighbors: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Enqueue Ian.\n   - Enqueue Puja.\n   - Enqueue Kim.\n   - Enqueue Sara.\n   - Add Moin as the parent of Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara in the path dictionary.\n6. Dequeue Ian.\n7. Ian has the following neighbors: Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Skip Moin since it has been visited.\n   - Enqueue Puja.\n   - Enqueue Kim.\n   - Enqueue Sara.\n   - Add Ian as the parent of Puja, Kim, and Sara in the path dictionary.\n8. Dequeue Puja.\n9. Puja has the following neighbors: Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Skip Pari since it has been visited.\n   - Skip Ian since it has been visited.\n   - Skip Sara since it has been visited.\n   - Skip Moin since it has been visited.\n10. Dequeue Kim.\n11. Kim has the following neighbors: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n    - Enqueue Wei.\n    - Enqueue Nisha.\n    - Enqueue Reza.\n    - Skip Moin since it has been visited.\n    - Add Kim as the parent of Wei, Nisha, and Reza in the path dictionary.\n12. Dequeue Sara.\n13. Sara has the following neighbors: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n    - Skip Ian since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Moin since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Puja since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Nisha since it has been visited.\n14. Dequeue Wei.\n15. Wei has the following neighbors: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n    - Skip Nisha since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Reza since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Kim since it has been visited.\n    - Enqueue Raj.\n    - Add Wei as the parent of Raj in the path dictionary.\n16. Dequeue Nisha.\n17. Nisha has the following neighbors: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n    - Skip Wei since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Reza since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Kim since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Sara since it has been visited.\n18. Dequeue Reza.\n19. Reza has the following neighbors: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n    - Skip Amir since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Kim since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Nisha since it has been visited.\n    - Skip Wei since it has been visited.\n20. Dequeue Raj.\n21. Raj has the following neighbors: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n    - Skip Amir since it has been visited.\n    - Enqueue Wim.\n    - Enqueue Jing.\n    - Skip Wei since it has been visited.\n    - Add Raj as the parent of Wim and Jing in the path dictionary.\n22. Dequeue Wim.\n23. Wim is the destination node. Stop the search.\n\nThe shortest path from Moin to Wim is: Moin, Kim, Wei, Raj, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Kim, Wei, Raj, Wim"
