Start with Ian as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Ian.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Raj, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar.\n   - Mark each enqueued scholar as visited.\n4. If the algorithm finishes without finding Raj, there is no path from Ian to Raj.\n\nNow let's apply the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Ian, Moin, Raj"
