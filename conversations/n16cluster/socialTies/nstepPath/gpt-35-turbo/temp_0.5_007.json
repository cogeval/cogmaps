Check the connections of Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n3. Check the connections of each scholar in step 2: Amir is connected to Reza, Wim is connected to Eva, Raj is connected to Wei, and Pam is connected to Pari.\n4. Check the connections of each scholar in step 3: Reza is connected to Kim, Eva is connected to Wim, Wei is connected to Nisha, and Pari is connected to Matt.\n5. Check the connections of each scholar in step 4: Kim is connected to Moin, Wim is already visited, Nisha is connected to Sara, and Matt is connected to Ian.\n6. Check the connections of each scholar in step 5: Moin is found.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Jing to Moin is: Jing, Pam, Pari, Matt, Ian, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Pari, Matt, Ian, Moin"
