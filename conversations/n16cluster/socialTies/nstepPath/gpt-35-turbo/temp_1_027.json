Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Puja what is the shortest path to Amir? Starting from Puja, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Puja, separated by commas."

Start with Puja as the initial node.\n2. Create an empty queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n3. Add Puja to the queue.\n4. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each node.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the dequeued node is not in the visited set:\n     - Add it to the visited set.\n     - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n       - If the neighbor is not in the visited set:\n         - Add it to the queue.\n         - Add the path from the dequeued node to the neighbor in the path dictionary.\n7. If the algorithm reaches this point, there is no path from Puja to Amir.\n8. Get the shortest path from the path dictionary by following the connections from Amir back to Puja.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Puja to Amir:\n\nAnswer: Puja, Moin, Ian, Wim, Amir"
