Start with Puja as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Puja.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-6.\n4. Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n5. Check if the dequeued node is Raj. If it is, the shortest path has been found. Proceed to step 7.\n6. If the dequeued node is not Raj, enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node and mark them as visited.\n7. Trace back the path from Raj to Puja by following the parent pointers, starting from Raj. This will give us the shortest path from Puja to Raj.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm:\n\nStarting from Puja (Scholar 11), the shortest path to Raj (Scholar 3) is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Puja, Ian, Moin, Raj"
