Start with a queue and add Kim to it.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if this scholar is Pam. If yes, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add the current scholar to the visited set.\n   - Check all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n     - If the connected scholar is not in the visited set, enqueue it and add it to the path.\n4. If we reach this point, it means there is no path from Kim to Pam.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Kim to Pam:\n\nAnswer: Kim, Wei, Raj, Amir, Jing, Pam"
