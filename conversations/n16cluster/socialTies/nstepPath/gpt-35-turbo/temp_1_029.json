We start with Matt (15) in the queue and add him to the visited set.\n\nQueue: [15]\nVisited: {15}\n\nNext, we traverse the connections of each scholar in the queue and add any unvisited scholars to the queue.\n\nQueue: [15]\nVisited: {15}\n\nConnections of Matt (15): Pari (13), Pam (14), Eva (16), Ian (10)\nAdd Pari (13) to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\nQueue: [13]\nVisited: {15, 13}\n\nConnections of Pari (13): Pam (14), Matt (15), Eva (16), Puja (11)\nAdd Pam (14) to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\nQueue: [13, 14]\nVisited: {15, 13, 14}\n\nConnections of Pam (14): Jing (4), Pari (13), Matt (15), Eva (16)\nAdd Jing (4) to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\nQueue: [13, 14, 4]\nVisited: {15, 13, 14, 4}\n\nConnections of Jing (4): Amir (1), Wim (2), Raj (3), Pam (14)\nAdd Amir (1) to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\nQueue: [13, 14, 4, 1]\nVisited: {15, 13, 14, 4, 1}\n\nConnections of Amir (1): Wim (2), Raj (3), Jing (4), Reza (7)\nReza (7) is the target scholar we are looking for.
