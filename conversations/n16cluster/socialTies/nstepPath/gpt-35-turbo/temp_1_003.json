Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n\n3. Add Wim to the queue.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first node from the queue (denoted as current node).\n   - Check if the current node is Moin. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If the current node is not Moin, add its adjacent nodes (based on the given connections) to the queue.\n\nFollowing this process, we can determine the shortest path from Wim to Moin."
