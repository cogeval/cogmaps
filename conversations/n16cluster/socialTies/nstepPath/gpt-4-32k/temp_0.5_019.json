According to the information given, Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n\nNext, check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Pam. From the given information, none of them are directly connected to Pam.\n\nTherefore, we need to check the scholars who are connected to Kim's connections. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nAmong these scholars, Amir and Jing are connected to Pam. Therefore, the shortest path from Kim to Pam will involve either Amir or Jing. \n\nFrom the given information, Reza is connected to both Kim and Amir. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Kim to Pam is Kim -> Reza -> Amir -> Jing -> Pam.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Reza, Amir, Jing, Pam"
