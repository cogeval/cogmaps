Moin is directly connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nExamining these connections, we see that none of them is directly connected to Wim. So, we need to go another level deeper.\n\nInvestigating Ian's connections, Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. But none of them is connected to Wim.\n\nLooking at Puja's connections, Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Again, none of them is connected to Wim.\n\nExploring Kim's connections, Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Still, none of them is connected to Wim.\n\nFinally, exploring Sara's connections, Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Nisha has not been explored yet.\n\nMoving to Nisha's connections, Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Here, Reza has not been explored yet.\n\nLooking at Reza's connections, Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Amir has not been explored yet.\n\nFinally, investigating Amir's connections, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nWim has been found. The path from Moin to Wim is Moin -> Sara -> Nisha -> Reza -> Amir -> Wim. This is the shortest path with a length of 5 connections.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Sara, Nisha, Reza, Amir, Wim."
