Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Matt what is the shortest path to Wei? Starting from Matt, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Matt, separated by commas."

Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. \n\nStep 2: We then consider the connections of each of these scholars to see who can bring us closest to Wei. \n\n- Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja but none of them are connected to Wei.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva but none of them are directly connected to Wei. \n- Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim, but none of them are directly connected to Wei. \n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Here, Moin is also connected to Kim who is connected to Wei. \n\nStep 3: To get from Matt to Wei, it seems the shortest path would be Matt -> Ian -> Moin -> Kim -> Wei. \n\nSo the scholar numbers in order starting from Matt are Matt, Ian, Moin, Kim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Matt, Ian, Moin, Kim, Wei"
