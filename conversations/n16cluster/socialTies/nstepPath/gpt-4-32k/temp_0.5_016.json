Check each connection, Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n4. None of the scholars connected to Nisha are directly connected to Eva.\n5. From Nisha's connections, Wei and Reza are connected to Amir. Amir is connected to Wim and Wim is connected to Eva. So, one path could be Nisha - Wei - Amir - Wim - Eva or Nisha - Reza - Amir - Wim - Eva. \n6. Another path could be Nisha - Kim - Moin - Ian - Matt - Eva. \n7. Comparing the two paths, the first one (Nisha - Wei - Amir - Wim - Eva or Nisha - Reza - Amir - Wim - Eva) is shorter.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Wei, Amir, Wim, Eva"
