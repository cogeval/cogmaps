Moin is directly connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nConsidering the shortest path, we want the least amount of intermediary connections. Analyzing the connections, we can go from Jing to Amir, then Amir to Reza, Reza to Kim, and finally, Kim to Moin. This path requires 3 intermediary connections, making it the shortest path. \n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
