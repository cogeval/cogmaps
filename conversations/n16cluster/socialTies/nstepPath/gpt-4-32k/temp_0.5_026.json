Puja is directly connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. \n\nSecond, let's look at the connections of these four scholars to see if any of them are directly connected to Raj. \n\n- Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja, but not Raj. \n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt, but not Raj. \n- Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha, but not Raj. \n- Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara, but not Raj. \n\nNone of these scholars are directly connected to Raj, so we need to look at the next level of connections.\n\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. So, the path from Puja to Raj through Pari and Pam would be Puja - Pari - Pam - Jing - Raj. \n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. None of these scholars are directly connected to Raj. \n- Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. So, the path from Puja to Raj through Pari and Eva would be Puja - Pari - Eva - Wim - Raj. \n- Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. So, the path from Puja to Raj through Sara and Nisha would be Puja - Sara - Nisha - Wei - Raj. \n- Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. So, the path from Puja to Raj through Moin and Kim would be Puja - Moin - Kim - Wei - Raj.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Puja to Raj is either Puja - Pari - Pam - Jing - Raj or Puja - Pari - Eva - Wim - Raj.\n\nAnswer: Puja, Pari, Pam, Jing, Raj or Puja, Pari, Eva, Wim, Raj"
