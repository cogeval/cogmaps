None of these are Kim, so disregard this path\nStep 6: Pam connects to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. None of these are Kim, so disregard this path\nStep 7: Matt connects to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. None of these are Kim, so disregard this path\nStep 8: Notice that all paths from Eva's immediate connections have been explored and none lead directly to Kim\nStep 9: Continue with Matt's connections - Ian connects to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt\nStep 10: Moin connects to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara, so Kim is found in 3 steps\n\nAnswer: Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin, Kim"
