Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nLet's see who is connected to Pari:\nPari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n\nFrom Wei's connections, Nisha and Reza also connect to Kim. We notice that Kim connects to Moin. Moin connects to Ian. From Pari's connections, Puja also connects to Ian. We can see the path from Wei now.\n\nHere is the shortest path from Wei to Pari: Wei - Kim - Moin - Ian - Puja - Pari.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Pari."
