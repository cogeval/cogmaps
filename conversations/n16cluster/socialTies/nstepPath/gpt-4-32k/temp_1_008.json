Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Reza what is the shortest path to Pari? Starting from Reza, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Reza, separated by commas."

We can eliminate Amir and Wei since they do not connect to Pari or connect to any scholar that connects to Pari.\n\nNext, we look at the scholars connected to Kim and Nisha. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Moin connects to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara, while Sara connects to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. From these connections, we can see that there is no direct link to Pari. \n\nThen, looking at the scholars connected to Ian and Puja, we find that Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt, and Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Here, we can see that Puja is directly connected to Pari.\n\nGiven all this information, the shortest path from Reza to Pari is: Reza to Nisha, Nisha to Sara, Sara to Puja, and finally Puja to Pari. \n\nAnswer: Reza, Nisha, Sara, Puja, Pari."
