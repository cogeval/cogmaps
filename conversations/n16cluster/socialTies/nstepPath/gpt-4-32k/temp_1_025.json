Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Ian what is the shortest path to Amir? Starting from Ian, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Ian, separated by commas."

He is directly connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. \n\nNow, let's explore the second degrees of connection from Ian's direct connections:\n- Moin is directly connected to Kim.\n- Puja is directly connected to Pari.\n- Sara is directly connected to Nisha.\n- Matt is directly connected to Eva.\n\nAfter exploring the second degrees, let's consider the third degrees:\n- Kim is directly connected to Reza.\n- Nisha is directly connected to Wei.\n- Eva is directly connected to Wim.\n- Pari and others have no connections to the desired person, Amir.\n\nNow let's consider the fourth degree, starting from our third degree connections:\n- Reza is directly connected to Amir. \n- All others from the third degree have no direct connections to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Ian to Amir is: Ian, Moin, Kim, Reza, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Ian, Moin, Kim, Reza, Amir."
