Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Kim what is the shortest path to Pam? Starting from Kim, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Kim, separated by commas."

This could be considered a graph problem, in which the scholars are nodes and the connections between them are edges.\n\n1. Starting from Kim, we see that Kim is directly connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n2. We then check each of these scholars to see if any of them are directly connected to Pam. None of them are, so we need to move one step further.\n3. We can then check each of the scholars that Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin are connected to.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n4. Amir and Raj are directly connected to Jing and Jing is directly connected to Pam. So we have found a possible path: Kim -> Reza -> Amir -> Jing -> Pam or Kim -> Wei -> Raj -> Jing -> Pam.\n5. We need to check if there's a shorter path. Considering all the connections, it appears there is no shorter path.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Kim to Pam includes Kim, Reza or Wei, Amir or Raj, Jing, and finally Pam.\n\nAnswer: Kim, Reza, Amir, Jing, Pam"
