Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n7. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n8. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n9. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n10. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n11. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n\nIf we trace the shortest path from Pam to Nisha, it would be:\n\n- Pam connects to Jing\n- Jing connects to Raj\n- Raj connects to Wei\n- Wei connects to Nisha\n\nSo, the shortest path from Pam to Nisha is Pam, Jing, Raj, Wei, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
