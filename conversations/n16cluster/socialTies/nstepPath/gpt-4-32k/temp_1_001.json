Then I will map the connections and try to find the shortest path between Amir and Ian. Considering that each scholar is connected to 4 others, I can assume the most direct route is through these connections. The connections might not necessarily be bidirectional, so I should pay attention to the direction of each connection. \n\nTo find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start from Amir, who is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. As none of them are directly connected to Ian, I need to check who they are connected to.\n3. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n4. None of these scholars are connected to Ian either, so I must go a step further.\n5. From Wim, I can go to Eva who is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. \n6. From Eva, I can go to Matt who is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. \n7. Finally, from Matt, I can go to Ian who is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. \n\nBy this method, I have found the shortest path from Amir to Ian through the network of scholars. The path is: Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian. Now, I will present the final answer.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian"
