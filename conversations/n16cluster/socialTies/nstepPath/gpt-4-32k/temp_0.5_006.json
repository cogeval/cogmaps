Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n6. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n8. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n9. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n10. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n11. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n12. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n13. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n14. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n15. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n16. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nNext, I will find the shortest path from Jing to Sara. I will start from Jing and try to reach Sara in the least number of steps:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. I will choose Raj because Raj is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Nisha, who is connected to Sara.\n2. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. I will choose Wei.\n3. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. I will choose Nisha.\n4. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. I will choose Sara.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Sara is Jing, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara."
