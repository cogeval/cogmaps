We are asked to find the shortest path from Matt to Reza. \n\n1. Matt is directly connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. \n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Reza, so we must find a scholar who is connected to Reza through one of Matt's connections. \n3. Pari is connected to Puja, Puja is connected to Moin, and Moin is connected to Kim, who is connected to Reza. \n4. Therefore, the shortest path from Matt to Reza is: Matt -> Pari -> Puja -> Moin -> Kim -> Reza.\n\nAnswer: Matt, Pari, Puja, Moin, Kim, Reza"
