Each scholar will be a node in the graph, and each connection between two scholars will be an edge in the graph.\n\nGraph:\n\n1: Amir is connected to 2: Wim, 3: Raj, 4: Jing, 5: Reza\n2: Wim is connected to 1: Amir, 3: Raj, 4: Jing, 16: Eva\n3: Raj is connected to 1: Amir, 2: Wim, 4: Jing, 6: Wei\n4: Jing is connected to 1: Amir, 2: Wim, 3: Raj, 15: Pam\n5: Reza is connected to 1: Amir, 7: Kim, 8: Nisha, 6: Wei\n6: Wei is connected to 7: Kim, 8: Nisha, 5: Reza, 3: Raj\n7: Kim is connected to 6: Wei, 8: Nisha, 5: Reza, 9: Moin\n8: Nisha is connected to 6: Wei, 5: Reza, 7: Kim, 11: Sara\n9: Moin is connected to 10: Ian, 13: Puja, 7: Kim, 11: Sara\n10: Ian is connected to 9: Moin, 13: Puja, 11: Sara, 14: Matt\n11: Sara is connected to 10: Ian, 9: Moin, 13: Puja, 8: Nisha\n12: Pari is connected to 15: Pam, 14: Matt, 16: Eva, 13: Puja\n13: Puja is connected to 12: Pari, 10: Ian, 11: Sara, 9: Moin\n14: Matt is connected to 12: Pari, 15: Pam, 16: Eva, 10: Ian\n15: Pam is connected to 4: Jing, 12: Pari, 14: Matt, 16: Eva\n16: Eva is connected to 12: Pari, 15: Pam, 14: Matt, 2: Wim\n\nNext, I will use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from Jing (4) to Sara (11). BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, in this case, Jing) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nJing (4) -> Amir (1) -> Wim (2) -> Eva (16) -> Matt (14) -> Ian (10) -> Sara (11)\n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Sara through scholars is 4, 1, 2, 16, 14, 10, 11.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Sara."
