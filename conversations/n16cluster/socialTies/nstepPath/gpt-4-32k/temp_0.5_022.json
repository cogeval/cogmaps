Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.

Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nFrom these scholars, we need to find the one that has the shortest path to Wim. \n\nLooking at the connections:\n\n1. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. None of these are directly connected to Wim.\n2. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. None of these are directly connected to Wim.\n3. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. None of these are directly connected to Wim.\n4. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. None of these are directly connected to Wim.\n\nNone of the scholars Moin is directly connected to have a direct connection to Wim. So we have to go one step further.\n\nFrom Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara's connections, only Matt (connected through Ian) and Eva (connected through Pari, who is connected to Puja) have a direct connection to Wim.\n\nSo the shortest path from Moin to Wim would be:\n\nMoin -> Ian -> Matt -> Wim\nor\nMoin -> Puja -> Pari -> Eva -> Wim\n\nBoth paths have four steps, so they are equally short.\n\nAnswer: Moin, Ian, Matt, Wim or Moin, Puja, Pari, Eva, Wim."
