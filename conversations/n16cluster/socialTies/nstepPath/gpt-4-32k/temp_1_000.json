Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. From Amir what is the shortest path to Puja? Starting from Amir, please list the scholar numbers in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, we need to figure out the shortest possible path through the connections.\n\nThe connections of the scholars directly connected to Amir are:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. \n2. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n3. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. \n4. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n\nLet's find out if any of them are directly connected to Puja:\n\n1. Eva is not connected to Puja. \n2. Wei is not connected to Puja. \n3. Pam is not connected to Puja. \n4. Kim is not connected to Puja.\n5. Nisha is not connected to Puja.\n\nFrom the scholars connected to Amir, none of them are connected to Puja. We need to go one step further:\n\nScholars connected to Eva, Wei, Pam, Kim, and Nisha are:\n\n1. Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. \n2. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n3. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. \n4. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n5. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n\nNow, let's see if any of them are connected to Puja:\n\n1. Pari is not connected to Puja. \n2. Matt is not connected to Puja.\n3. Moin is connected to Puja.\n4. Sara is connected to Puja.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Puja could be Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin -> Puja or Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian -> Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin, Puja"
