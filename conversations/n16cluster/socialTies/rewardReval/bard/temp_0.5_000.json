Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This path has a total of **60 books**, since Sara has 10 books and Moin has 50 books.\n\nThe regular expression for the answer is `Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+`.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Sara, Moin\n```\n\nHere are the steps on how I arrived at the answer:\n\n1. I first identified the scholars who have the most books. These are Moin, with 50 books, and Sara, with 10 books.\n2. I then found the shortest path from Amir to Moin. The shortest path to Moin is Amir \u2192 Wim \u2192 Sara \u2192 Moin.\n3. I chose the path with the most books, which is Amir \u2192 Wim \u2192 Sara \u2192 Moin.\n\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n**Note:** The answer is the same as the previous answer, because the changes you made to the network do not affect the shortest path from Amir to Moin."
