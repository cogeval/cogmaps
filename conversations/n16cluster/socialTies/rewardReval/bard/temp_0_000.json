Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This path has a total of **10 books**, since Sara has 10 books.\n\nThe regular expression for the answer is `Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+`.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Sara\n```\n\nHere are the steps on how I arrived at the answer:\n\n1. I first identified the scholars who have the most books. These are Sara, with 10 books, and Moin, with 50 books. However, Amir and Reza are no longer connected, so Moin is no longer reachable from Amir.\n2. I then found the shortest path from Amir to Sara. The shortest path to Sara is Amir \u2192 Wim \u2192 Sara.\n3. I chose the path with the most books, which is Amir \u2192 Wim \u2192 Sara.\n\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n**Note:** The answer is the same as the previous answer, because the changes you made to the network do not affect the shortest path from Amir to Sara.\n\n**However, I have a question for you.**\n\nIn the prompt, you mentioned that **Moin is donating 50 books** and **Matt is donating 10 books**. However, if we only consider the **number of books** that each scholar has, then the **shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books** would be **Amir, Wim, Sara, Moin**. This path has a total of **60 books**, since Sara has 10 books and Moin has 50 books.\n\nSo, I'm a little confused. Which path is the correct one?\n\n**Is it the path with the most books**, or **the path that starts with Amir and ends with the person with the most books**?\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."
