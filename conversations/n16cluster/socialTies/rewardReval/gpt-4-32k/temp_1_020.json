Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Since Moin is donating 50 books which is the highest, we start from Amir and try to find the shortest path to Moin.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Since neither Wim, Raj, Jing, or Reza are directly connected to Moin, we have to find an indirect connection to Moin.\n\nLooking at the connections, Reza is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin. Hence, the shortest path to reach from Amir to Moin is via Reza and Kim.\n\nSo, the list of scholars from Amir to Moin, including Amir, separated by commas is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

The objective is to find the shortest path from Amir to Matt.\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. But none of these people are directly connected to Matt. Therefore, we need to find an indirect path to Matt.\n\nObserving the connections, we notice that Wim is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt.
