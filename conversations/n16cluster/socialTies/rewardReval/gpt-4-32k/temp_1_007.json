Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

The goal is to identify the shortest path from Amir to either Moin or Matt.\n\nNext, I'll examine the relationships between the scholars to map out potential paths from Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. From examining the other scholar's connections, none of these scholars have a direct link to either Moin or Matt. Therefore, we have to go to the next level of connections.\n\nAmong Amir's connections, Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt. Thus, one path from Amir to a person with books is Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt.\n\nAmong Amir's connections, Reza is connected to Wei, who is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin. Thus, another path from Amir to a person with books is Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin.\n\nComparing the two paths, the path Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin is longer than the path Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt. However, Moin has 50 books while Matt only has 10.\n\nAs the goal is to reach the person with the maximum number of books, I will choose the path Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin, even though it is longer.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
