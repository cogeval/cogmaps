Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Therefore, Moin is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. We can see that Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars are directly connected to Moin, so we need to find a scholar who is connected to Moin and is also connected to one of Amir's contacts.\n\nLooking at the connections, we find that Kim is connected to Moin and also to Reza, who is one of Amir's contacts. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
