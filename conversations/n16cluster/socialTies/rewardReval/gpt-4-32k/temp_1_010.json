Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Reza is the closest to the group that includes Moin, as Reza is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Nisha, who in turn is connected to Sara. \n5. Sara is directly connected to Moin, who has the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin. \n\nIn the end, I will convert my findings according to the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+'. \n\nIn this case, the answer will be: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin."
