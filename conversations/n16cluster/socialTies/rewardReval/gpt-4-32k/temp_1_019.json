Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will choose the path leading us closer to Moin.\n\nStep 3: If we look at the people connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza, none of them are directly connected to Moin. However, Reza is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Moin.\n\nStep 4: Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order starting from Amir are Amir, Reza, Kim, and Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
