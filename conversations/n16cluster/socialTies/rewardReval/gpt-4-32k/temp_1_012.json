Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Here, Moin has donated 50 books and Matt has donated 10. Thus, Moin is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nSecond, we look at the connections. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these are Moin.\n\nThird, looking at the second-degree connections (the people that Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza are connected to), Moin is not a second-degree connection either.\n\nFourth, looking at the third-degree connections (the people that the second-degree connections are connected to), we find Moin. Moin is a third-degree connection from Amir through the path Amir -> Jing -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nFinally, we put the names in order as requested, with each name separated by a comma.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Kim, Moin"
