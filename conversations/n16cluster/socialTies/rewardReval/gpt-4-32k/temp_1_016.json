Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Between Moin and Matt, Moin has the most books with a total of 50. Now we need to analyze the connections and identify the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nHowever, none of them are directly connected to Moin. Now, check the next level of connections. Raj is connected to Wei who is connected to Kim who is connected to Moin. This path includes four scholars. \n\nAlso, Reza is connected to Nisha who is connected to Wei who is connected to Kim who is connected to Moin. This path includes five scholars.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Raj, Wei, and Kim. This is the smallest number of connections from Amir to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"

We'll need to look at the next level of connections.\n\nJing is connected to Pam who is connected to Matt. This path includes three scholars. \n\nOn the other hand, Wim is connected to Eva who is also connected to Matt. This path includes three scholars too.\n\nSo, the shortest paths from Amir to Matt are through Jing and Pam or through Wim and Eva.
