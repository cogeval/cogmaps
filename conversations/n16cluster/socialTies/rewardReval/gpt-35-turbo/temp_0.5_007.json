Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars and their distances from Amir.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n4. Add Amir to the queue with a distance of 0 and set the number of books for Amir to 0.\n5. Mark Amir as visited.\n6. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n    a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n    b. If the scholar has more books than the maximum number of books found so far, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n    c. If the scholar is not the person with the maximum number of books, enqueue their connected scholars (if not visited) with an increased distance and update their number of books.\n    d. Mark the current scholar as visited.\n7. Once the loop is finished, we will have the person with the maximum number of books and the shortest path from Amir to that person.\n\nNow, let's implement the steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari"
