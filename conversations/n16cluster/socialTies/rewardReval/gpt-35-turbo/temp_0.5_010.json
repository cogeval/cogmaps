Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and update the number of books donated by them.\n   - If the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n7.
