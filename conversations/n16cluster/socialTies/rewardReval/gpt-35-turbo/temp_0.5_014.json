We start from Amir and explore the connections in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n4. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n5. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n6. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n7. Check Eva's connections: Wim, Pari, Pam, Matt.\n8. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n9. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n10. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n11.
