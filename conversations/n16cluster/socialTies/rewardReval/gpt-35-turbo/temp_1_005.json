We will start from Amir and follow the connections to determine the path.\n\nGiven the connections provided, we can infer the following connections:\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n- Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n- Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n- Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n- Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n- Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n- Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n- Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n- Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nBased on the connections, we can conclude that Moin is donating 50 books, and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, we need to evaluate the connections and the number of books donated by each person. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n5. Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n6. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n\nFrom the above steps, we can see that Matt is connected to Ian, who is connected to Moin, who is connected to Kim, who is connected to Wei, who is connected to Raj, who is connected to Amir. Thus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Matt) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin, Ian, Matt"
