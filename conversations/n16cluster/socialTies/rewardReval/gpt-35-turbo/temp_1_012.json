Let's check the book donations:\n\n- Moin is donating 50 books.\n- Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nFirst, let's check Amir's connections:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim\n2. Amir -> Raj\n3. Amir -> Jing\n4. Amir -> Reza\n\nNow let's examine Wim's connections:\n\n1. Wim -> Amir\n2. Wim -> Raj\n3. Wim -> Jing\n4. Wim -> Eva\n\nSince Eva is not connected to Amir, we can exclude her from consideration. \n\nNext, let's examine Raj's connections:\n\n1. Raj -> Amir\n2. Raj -> Wim\n3. Raj -> Jing\n4. Raj -> Wei\n\nNow, let's examine Jing's connections:\n\n1. Jing -> Amir\n2. Jing -> Wim\n3. Jing -> Raj\n4. Jing -> Pam\n\nAs Pam is not connected to Amir, we can exclude her.\n\nMoving on, let's examine Reza's connections:\n\n1. Reza -> Amir\n2. Reza -> Kim\n3. Reza -> Nisha\n4.

Amir -> Reza -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin\n2. Amir -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin\n\nSince Moin has the maximum number of book donations (50), the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"
