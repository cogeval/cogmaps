Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We start with Amir and explore his connections one by one. Since we are interested in the person with the maximum number of books, we need to keep track of the number of books each person has. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the initial variables:\n   - Start with Amir.\n   - Initialize an empty queue.\n   - Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n   - Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has, initially with Amir having 0 books.\n\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Check all the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited, add them to the queue, mark them as visited, and update their number of books based on the current scholar.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all scholars have been visited.\n\n4. The final outcome will be the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, including Amir. Return the scholar names separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
