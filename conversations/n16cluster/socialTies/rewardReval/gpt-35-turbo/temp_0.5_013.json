Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n4. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n5. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n6. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n7. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n8. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n9. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n10. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n11. Check Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n12. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n13. Check Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n14.

Check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections. Now, we need to find the scholar with the maximum number of books. Moin is donating 50 books, and Matt is donating 10 books. Since Moin has more books, we will choose Moin as the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
