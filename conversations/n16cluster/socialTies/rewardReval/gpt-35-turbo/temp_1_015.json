Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n     - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n     - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Moin"
