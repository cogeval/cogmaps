As per the given information, Maggie can donate the most money, which is $500K. \n\nNow, we need to find the path from Paul to Maggie. Paul is directly connected to Bob, Nick, Sherry, and John. Bob is connected to Rose, who cannot donate anything, so we need to skip Bob. Nick is connected to Amanda, but we need to pay $10K to get connected with her, so we skip Nick as well. Sherry is connected to William, who is not connected to Maggie, so we skip Sherry too. John is connected to Amanda, but we need to pay $10K to get connected with her, so we skip John as well.\n\nNow, we need to look for other connections. Amanda is connected to Peter, who is connected to Andrew. Andrew is connected to Jennifer, who is connected to Maggie. So, the path from Paul to Maggie is: Paul -> John -> Amanda -> Peter -> Andrew -> Jennifer -> Maggie.\n\nAnswer: Paul, John, Amanda, Peter, Andrew, Jennifer, Maggie."
