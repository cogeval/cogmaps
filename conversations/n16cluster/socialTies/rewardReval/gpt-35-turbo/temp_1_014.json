We will keep track of the number of books each person has as we traverse the graph. \n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each person has, starting with Moin having 50 books and Matt having 10 books.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each person, starting with Amir's shortest path being just Amir.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum book count. If yes, update the maximum book count and store the current shortest path.\n   - For each neighbor of the current scholar:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the neighbor to the queue.\n       - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n       - Update the number of books the neighbor has based on the person they received books from.\n       - Update the shortest path from Amir to the neighbor.\n6.
