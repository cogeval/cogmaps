Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue and enqueue Amir as the starting point.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the previous scholar for each scholar.\n5. Set the distance of Amir to 0 in the distance dictionary.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar:\n     - If the scholar has not been visited:\n       - Enqueue the scholar.\n       - Update the distance dictionary with the distance from Amir to the scholar.\n       - Update the previous scholar dictionary with the previous scholar for the current scholar.\n7. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n8. Backtrack from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the previous scholar dictionary to find the shortest path.\n9. Return the shortest path, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
