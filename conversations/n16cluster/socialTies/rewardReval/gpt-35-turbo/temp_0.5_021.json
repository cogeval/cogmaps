Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable \"max_books\" to 0 and a variable \"max_books_scholar\" to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has more books than the current \"max_books\", update \"max_books\" and \"max_books_scholar\".\n   - Enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar into the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty.\n6. The shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is the sequence of scholars visited during the BFS traversal.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin"
