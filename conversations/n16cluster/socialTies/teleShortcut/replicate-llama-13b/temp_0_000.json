            "content": "\nThis problem can be solved using the following approach. To make a path in a tree, we start from a node called the root. This node has no parents. From the root we follow some branches to create path. Each branch in the path has one parent branch while the root has no parent branch. We create an array to store paths from Amir. Initially we set it to an empty array. If we check the path going through Amir there is no possible path. Therefore, we create a new node which we call Amir's parent. Then if we check the path going through Amir's parent we note no parent for Amir's parent. Therefore, we create a new node called parent of the node Amir's parent. Going forward, creating nodes and adding them to the array. At the end, the root node is the result. When we get the number of books to be donated, we remove all the nodes that are not connected to the root (the node with least number of books) and keep the result.\nTo get the number of books to be donated, you can use the following approach.\nStart with n (the number of scholars) and divide it until some value becomes 0.\nIf you divide by 4, you will end up with 2. After this step, the number of books to be take is 2 and at step 4, 10-2 would be the amount to donate.\nFrom this value, you can find the answer using the following algorithm.\nGo from the root to the last node by going down the tree.\nIf the last node's amount is 0, there is no path going out of this node. Therefore, the answer is to be taken from the root.\nBut if the number is not zero, divide by every number going down to the parent.\nAt the end of the algorithm there will be an array with all the paths of length 0 from the root. It will be something like: [0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0] and so on\nIf the number of paths is the same as the number of non-zero numbers, meaning going from the root, you can find the number of nodes in the tree that have non-zero number and use this value as the answer.\nAn example of implementing the algorithm:\nFor (t in"

A value will not be donated to a scholar with no students so Y will be equal with X. Next we create the values for the matrix for the value of X and Y. Then we solve linear equaion for the value of X. The result will be the number of students that can be taken by the given student.\nYou can check the answer in the following section with the same values to see that what we calculated is correct.\nWe define some variables and the matrix:\na =  [X_I, Y_J]\nb =  [Y_I, X_J]\n"
