Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will keep track of the number of books each person has and the path taken to reach them.\n\nStarting from Amir, we know the following connections:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nReza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nKim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nFrom this information, we can create a graph:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\nWim -> Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\nRaj -> Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\nJing -> Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\nReza -> Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\nWei -> Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\nNisha -> Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\nKim -> Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\nIan -> Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\nMoin -> Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\nPuja -> Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\nSara -> Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\nPari -> Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\nPam -> Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\nMatt -> Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\nEva -> Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\nNow we can perform a breadth-first search to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books. We will assign a value of 0 to Amir and keep track of the path taken to reach each person.\n\nThe algorithm will work as follows:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty visited set.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the path to each person.\n4. Initialize the maximum_books variable to 0 and the max_books_person variable to None.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Remove the first person from the queue.\n    - If this person has more books than the maximum_books variable:\n        - Update the maximum_books variable with the number of books this person has.\n        - Update the max_books_person variable with this person's name.\n    - If this person has not been visited:\n        - Add the person to the visited set.\n        - Add the person and their path to the dictionary.\n        - Add all the person's connections to the queue.\n            - Update each connection's path with the current person's path + the connection.\n6. Return the path stored in the dictionary for the max_books_person variable.\n\nApplying this algorithm:\n\n1. Add Amir to the queue and initialize the visited set and the path dictionary.\n2. Remove Amir from the queue.\n3. As Amir has 0 books, we continue.\n4. Amir has not been visited, so we add him to the visited set and update his path in the dictionary.\n5. Add Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza to the queue.\n6. Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n7. The maximum_books variable is still 0, so we do not update it.\n8. The max_books_person variable remains None.\n9. The algorithm ends, and we return the path stored in the dictionary for the max_books_person variable.\n\nAnswer: Amir"
