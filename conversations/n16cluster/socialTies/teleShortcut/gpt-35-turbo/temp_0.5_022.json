Start from Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n4. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n6. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n7. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n8. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n9. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n10. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n11.
