Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start with Amir and explore each connected scholar one by one until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nStarting from Amir, the connected scholars are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Among these scholars, we need to check who has the maximum number of books and continue the search from that scholar.\n\nLet's calculate the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\n- Amir: 0 books\n- Wim: 0 books\n- Raj: 0 books\n- Jing: 0 books\n- Reza: 0 books\n- Wei: 0 books\n- Nisha: 0 books\n- Kim: 0 books\n- Moin: 50 books (maximum number)\n- Ian: 0 books\n- Puja: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n- Pari: 0 books\n- Pam: 0 books\n- Matt: 10 books\n\nSince Moin has the maximum number of books, we will continue the search from Moin. The connected scholars of Moin are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nCalculating the number of books donated by each of these scholars:\n\n- Ian: 0 books\n- Puja: 0 books\n- Kim: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n\nNone of these scholars have any books. So, we need to expand the search further.\n\nThe connected scholars of Ian are Moin, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Calculating the number of books donated by these scholars:\n\n- Moin: 50 books (maximum number)\n- Puja: 0 books\n- Kim: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n\nSince Moin still has the maximum number of books, we will continue the search from Moin. The connected scholars of Moin are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nCalculating the number of books donated by each of these scholars:\n\n- Puja: 0 books\n- Kim: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n\nNone of these scholars have any books. We need to expand the search further.\n\nThe connected scholars of Puja are Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Calculating the number of books donated by these scholars:\n\n- Pari: 0 books\n- Ian: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n- Moin: 50 books (maximum number)\n\nSince Moin still has the maximum number of books, we will continue the search from Moin. The connected scholars of Moin are Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nCalculating the number of books donated by each of these scholars:\n\n- Ian: 0 books\n- Kim: 0 books\n- Sara: 0 books\n\nNone of these scholars have any books.

However, we have already visited Moin before, so we can conclude that Moin is the person with the maximum number of books and there is no shorter path from Amir to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
