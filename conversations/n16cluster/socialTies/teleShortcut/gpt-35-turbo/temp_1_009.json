Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each connected scholar one level at a time until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the scholars connected to Amir (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n3. Check if any of these scholars have more books than the previous maximum.\n4. If yes, update the maximum number of books and store the name of the scholar.\n5. Continue the BFS process by moving to the next level of scholars (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza).\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all connected scholars have been explored.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's calculate the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAmir -> Wim (Wim has 0 books)\nAmir -> Raj (Raj has 0 books)\nAmir -> Jing (Jing has 0 books)\nAmir -> Reza (Reza has 0 books)\n\nSince all the connected scholars have 0 books, there is no shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no scholar connected to Amir with the maximum number of books."
