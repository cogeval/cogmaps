Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Initialize an empty queue and add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n6. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n7. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 8-14.\n8. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and mark them as visited.\n9. If the number of books donated by the current scholar is greater than the maximum number of books seen so far, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum books.\n10. Check each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited. If a connected scholar is found, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n11. Calculate the number of books donated by the connected scholar by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n12. If the connected scholar is not in the shortest path dictionary, add them with the shortest path from Amir through the current scholar.\n13. If the connected scholar is already in the shortest path dictionary, compare the length of the current shortest path with the shortest path through the current scholar.
