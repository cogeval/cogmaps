Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Initialize the queue with Amir and add Amir to the visited set.\n5. Initialize the maximum number of books as 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books as None.\n6. Iterate while the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Iterate through the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar is not visited:\n       - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n       - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n   - Repeat until all scholars are visited.\n7.
