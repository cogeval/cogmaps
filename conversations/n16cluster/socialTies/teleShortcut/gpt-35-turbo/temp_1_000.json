Starting from Amir, we can determine the shortest path as follows:\n\nAmir (0 books) -> Reza (0 books) -> Nisha (50 books)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Nisha"

The path from Amir to Nisha has fewer connections:\n\nAmir (0 books) -> Reza (0 books) -> Nisha (50 books)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering the connection portal through Amy, is:\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Nisha"
