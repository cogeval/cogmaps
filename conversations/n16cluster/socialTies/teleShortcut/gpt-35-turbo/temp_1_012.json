Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and explore each of his connections one by one.\n\nStarting from Amir, the connections are: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\n1. From Amir, we first explore Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n2. Next, we explore Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n3. Then, we explore Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n4. Finally, we explore Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Moin is donating 50 books, and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nNow, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books among these connections. Let's analyze the book donations for each connection:\n\nAmir: No information about book donation.\n\nWim: No information about book donation.\n\nRaj: No information about book donation.\n\nJing: No information about book donation.\n\nReza: No information about book donation.\n\nKim: No information about book donation.\n\nNisha: No information about book donation.\n\nWei: No information about book donation.\n\nMoin: Donating 50 books.\n\nBased on the given information, Moin has the maximum number of books with a donation of 50 books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is: Amir, Reza, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"

From Amir, we first explore Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n2. Next, we explore Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n3. Then, we explore Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n4. Finally, we explore Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n\nNow, we consider the connection portal through Amy. Since Amy has an instant connection portal to Sara's connections, we can directly connect to them.\n\nFrom Sara's connections, we have the following connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n\n1. Connecting through Amy to Sara's connections:\n   - Connecting to Ian: Amir, Matt, Ian.\n   - Connecting to Moin: Amir, Matt, Moin.\n   - Connecting to Puja: Amir, Matt, Puja.\n   - Connecting to Nisha: Amir, Matt, Nisha.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Moin is donating 50 books, and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nNow, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books among these connections.
