Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Then, we can choose the scholar who has the maximum number of books and is the closest to Amir. \n\nUsing Jing's instant connection portal, we can calculate the distances from Amir to all scholars who are donating books as follows:\n\n- Amir -> Reza: 1 connection\n- Amir -> Wei: 2 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Wei)\n- Amir -> Nisha: 3 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha)\n- Amir -> Sara: 4 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Sara)\n- Amir -> Ian: 3 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Wim -> Eva -> Ian)\n- Amir -> Moin: 4 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin)\n- Amir -> Matt: 3 connections (Amir -> Jing -> Pam -> Matt)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is: Amir -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin. \n\nThe scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, are: Amir, Jing, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin."
