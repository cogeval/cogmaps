Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar one by one, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum number of books.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all unvisited connections of the scholar.\n   - Update the number of books donated by each connection based on the current scholar's donation.\n7. Once the queue is empty, we will have the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n8. Trace back the path from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the connections.\n9.
