We'll start from Amir and explore the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n5. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n6. Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n7. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that Moin is connected to Sara, who is donating the maximum number of books.
