Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections, excluding Amir itself:\n   - For Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Continue this process, checking the connections of each scholar until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n   - For Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n   - For Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n   - For Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n   - For Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n   - For Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - For Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n5. Finally, we determine the person with the maximum number of books:\n   - Moin is donating 50 books.\n   - Matt is donating 10 books.\n   - Therefore, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
