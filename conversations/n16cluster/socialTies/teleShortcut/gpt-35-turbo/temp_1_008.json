Let's find the shortest path from Amir to Moin and Matt separately and compare the number of books donated by each of them.\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2.

Since Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books, we can conclude that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir -> Reza -> Wei -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
