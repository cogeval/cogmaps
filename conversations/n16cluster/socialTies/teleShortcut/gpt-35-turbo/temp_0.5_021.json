Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Initialize the queue with Amir and set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n5. Initialize the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b.
