Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books they have donated. We will continue this process until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books to 0 and a variable max_books_scholar to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has more books donated than max_books, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n   - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given information, we get the following steps:\n\n1. Enqueue Amir.\n2. Dequeue Amir. Amir has not donated any books, so max_books and max_books_scholar remain unchanged.\n3. Enqueue Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Dequeue Wim.
