Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Once you are connected to Jing, you can then connect to Moin, who has the maximum number of books (50).\n\nHere is the regular expression that matches the answer:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words. The last word in the list must not be followed by a comma.\n\nThe answer to the user's question matches this regular expression, so it is a valid answer.\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Moin\n```\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the shortest path:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Jing.\n2. Jing can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time.\n3. Moin has the maximum number of books (50).\n4. Therefore, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Jing, Moin.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
