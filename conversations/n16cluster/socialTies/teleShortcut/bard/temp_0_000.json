Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Once you are connected to Jing, you can then connect to Moin, who has the maximum number of books (50).\n\nHere is the regular expression that matches the answer:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words. The last word in the list must not be followed by a comma.\n\nThe answer to the user's question matches this regular expression, so it is a valid answer.\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Moin\n```"
