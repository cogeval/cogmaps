Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So, we need to find a path that reaches Moin in three steps. \n\nLooking at the connections again:\n\n- Eva (connected to Wim) is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n- Wei (connected to Raj and Reza) is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n- Pam (connected to Jing) is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n- Kim (connected to Reza) is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n- Nisha (connected to Wei and Reza) is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n\nFrom these connections, we see that Kim, who is connected to Reza, is also connected to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
