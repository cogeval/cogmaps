Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Reza, on the other hand, is connected to Wei, who is directly connected to Moin (50 books). \nSince Moin has more books than Matt, the shortest path from Amir should go through Reza and Wei to reach Moin. \nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is Amir, Reza, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Moin"
