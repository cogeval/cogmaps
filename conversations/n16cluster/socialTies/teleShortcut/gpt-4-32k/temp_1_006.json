First, identify the scholar with the maximum number of books. Here, Moin has 50 books, which is the maximum number of donated books.\n2. Next, create a network map based on the given connections of scholars. \n3. Then, find the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nFrom the given connections:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \nAmir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian -> Moin\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Wim, Eva, Matt, and Ian.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin"
