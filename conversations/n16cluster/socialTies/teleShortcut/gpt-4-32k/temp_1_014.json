Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Next, consider the number of books each of Amir's direct connections can reach. Wim can reach Eva, who can reach Matt, but Matt only has 10 books. Raj can reach Wei, who can reach Kim, who can reach Moin, but this is a long path. Jing can reach Pam, who can reach Pari, who can reach Puja, who can finally reach Moin, but again this is a longer path. Reza can reach Kim, who can directly reach Moin, so this is the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nSo, to get to the person with the maximum number of books, the shortest path from Amir would be Amir > Reza > Kim > Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
