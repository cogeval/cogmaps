Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We need to find the shortest path between Amir and the scholar who has the most books.\n\n2. From the provided data, we know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\n3. So, we are looking for the shortest path from Amir to Moin, as Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\n4. Here are Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\n5. To find the shortest path, we need to trace the connections to Moin. \n\n   - Wim isn't directly connected to Moin.\n   - Raj isn't directly connected to Moin.\n   - Jing isn't directly connected to Moin.\n   - Reza is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin.\n\n6. So, the shortest path is Amir to Reza, Reza to Kim, and Kim to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

We know from the previous task that Moin is the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\n2. Amy can instantly connect to any of Sara's connections, which means we have to look at Sara's connections to find a connection to Moin.\n\n3. Here are Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n\n4. Moin is directly connected to Sara.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, considering Amy's instant portal, is from Amir to Amy, and then through the portal to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin"
