Based on the information given, we know that Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n\nStarting from Amir, we need to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books. We know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Therefore, Moin is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars is Moin or is directly connected to Moin.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. None of these scholars is Moin or is directly connected to Moin.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. None of these scholars is Moin or is directly connected to Moin.\n4. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of these scholars is Moin or is directly connected to Moin.\n5. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is directly connected to Moin.\n6. From Kim, we can reach Moin directly.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
