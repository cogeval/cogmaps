Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books, so Moin is the scholar with the most books. \n\nLooking at the connections, I can then determine the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\n- Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n- None of them are directly connected to Moin.\n- Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, but Matt is not our target. \n- Raj is connected to Wei, but Wei is not connected to Moin.\n- Jing is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Matt, but again Matt is not our target.\n- Reza is directly connected to Kim.\n- Kim is directly connected to Moin.\n\nFrom this information, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
