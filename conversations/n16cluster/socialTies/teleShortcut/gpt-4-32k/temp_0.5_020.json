Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Hence, Moin has the maximum number of books. I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars are directly connected to Moin, so I need to go one step further.\n\nChecking the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza, I find that Kim is connected to Reza and Moin is connected to Kim. Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."

This means that through Amy, Amir can directly connect to any of these scholars.\n\nSince Moin is one of Sara's connections, the shortest path from Amir to Moin now involves Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is: Amir, Amy, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Amy, Moin."
