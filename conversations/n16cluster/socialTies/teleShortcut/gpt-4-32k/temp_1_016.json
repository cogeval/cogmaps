Among those connections, Wim is directly connected to Eva; Reza is directly connected to Wei who is then connected to Kim; Jing is directly connected to Pam.\n3. Eva is directly connected to Matt who is donating 10 books; and Kim is connected to Moin who is donating 50 books which is the maximum. \n\nBy evaluating the shortest paths, we can see that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum books, Moin, is: Amir > Reza > Wei > Kim > Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin"
