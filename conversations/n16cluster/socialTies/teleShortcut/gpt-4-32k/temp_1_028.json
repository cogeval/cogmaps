Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Out of these, both Wim and Jing are connected to Matt, who is the closest person to Amir that is donating books. Raj and Reza do not have a direct or one-step connection to a book-donating scholar. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to a scholar donating the maximum number of books is through Wim or Jing to Matt. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Matt"
