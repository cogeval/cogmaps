Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

According to the given relationships, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nNext step is to determine who of those scholars are connected to Moin.\n\n- Wim is not connected to Moin.\n- Raj is not connected to Moin.\n- Jing is not connected to Moin.\n- Reza is connected to Moin through Kim.\n\nNow, we need to check who Kim is connected to, because Kim is the only one from Amir's connections that can get us to Moin.\n\nFrom the given relationships, Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and then Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
