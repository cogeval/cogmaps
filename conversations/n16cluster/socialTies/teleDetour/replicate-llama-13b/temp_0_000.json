There is nothing mentioned in the background knowledge related to what the sentence refers to. There is a question in a newspaper. It asks, \"Of all the presidents of the United States, who had the most children?\" This is the text of the input sentence: Of all the presidents of the United States, who had the most children? What is the answer to the question in the sentence? Consider the example below: Here a question of the form \"Who had the most children?\" follows, so we look for \"of\" as the relevant word in this part. You look: Of all the presidents of the United States.\nYou are a judge at a tournament (a \"bot-off\"). You will evaluate some programs. You will give a score of 0-100 for each program, and the program scoring the 0 with the highest score will be declared champion. The final score will be the sum of the scores for each program. You will be given a programming environment to do so. You will now need to evaluate a program.\nYou are a judge at a tournament (a \"bot-off\"). You judge programs. You are given a programming environment to do so. This programming environment allows you to write a program that takes input and gives output. That program outputs 4382 numbers starting with the number 2529. You judge the program and give it a score of 432. Afterwards, you are told that a bug has been fixed and so the program has to be run again.\nProgrammatic AI\nYou are being graded on your ability to complete tasks and you may make mistakes. Programmatic AI: Consider how you would complete this sentence: I have ten dollars; I spend money only on groceries. The number of dollars remaining is now less than or equal to $20. Suppose you do not know which of two answers is correct. How will you select the correct answer?\nYou are a judge at a tournament (a \"bot-off\"). You judge programs. You are given some input about the tournament and programs to judge. For a program you judge, the input says: \"Alice is trying to solve the problem with the fastest program so far. She is using the following program:\" Here the input mentions Alice and says she is trying to solve the problem with a program. But the program is used"
