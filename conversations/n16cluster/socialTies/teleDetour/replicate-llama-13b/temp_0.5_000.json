In each side of the square, one of 4 digits exists. For example, the 1st side has 1234, the 2nd side has 234, the 3rd side has 34, and the 4th side has 4. You pick one dotted row such that the first dotted digit is from the 3rd side, second dotted digit is from 4th side, and the third dotted digit is from 1st side. After the pick, you are given all dotted digits.
