Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. Finally, we will select the scholar with the maximum number of books among the ones at the shortest distance from Amir.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n2. Initialize a distance dictionary with Amir's name as the key and 0 as the initial distance.\n3. Initialize a books dictionary with each scholar's name as the key and 0 as the initial number of books.\n4. Initialize a maximum_books variable with 0 as the initial value.\n5. Initialize a path list with Amir's name as the first element.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   7. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   8. If the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum_books value, update the maximum_books value.\n   9. For each connected scholar of the current scholar:\n      10. If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n          11. Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n          12. Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n          13. Update the distance dictionary with the distance of the connected scholar from Amir.\n          14. Update the books dictionary with the number of books the connected scholar has donated.\n          15. If the connected scholar has donated more books than the current maximum_books value, update the maximum_books value.\n   16. If there are scholars in the queue, repeat from step 7.\n17. Find the scholar(s) with the maximum number of books.\n18. If there is more than one scholar with the maximum number of books, select the one at the shortest distance from Amir.\n19. Generate the shortest path by backtracking from the selected scholar to Amir using the distance dictionary.\n20. Return the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
