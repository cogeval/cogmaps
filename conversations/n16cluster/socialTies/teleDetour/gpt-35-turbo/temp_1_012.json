Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Let's start from Amir and explore the connections in a breadth-first manner:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, we check his connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Next, we check the connections of each of these scholars:\n   - From Wim, we have Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - From Raj, we have Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - From Jing, we have Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - From Reza, we have Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n3. Continuing the exploration, we check the connections of each newly discovered scholar:\n   - From Eva, we have Wim, Raj, Jing, and Pari.\n   - From Wei, we have Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - From Pam, we have Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - From Kim, we have Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - From Nisha, we have Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - From Moin, we have Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - From Pari, we have Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - From Matt, we have Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - From Ian, we have Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - From Sara, we have Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - From Puja, we have Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n4. We continue this process until we have explored all the scholars in the group.\n\nNow, let's find the scholar with the maximum number of books. We know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Let's calculate the number of books each scholar has:\n\n- Amir: Unknown\n- Wim: Unknown\n- Raj: Unknown\n- Jing: Unknown\n- Reza: Unknown\n- Eva: Unknown\n- Wei: Unknown\n- Pam: Unknown\n- Kim: Unknown\n- Nisha: Unknown\n- Moin: 50 books\n- Pari: Unknown\n- Matt: 10 books\n- Ian: Unknown\n- Sara: Unknown\n- Puja: Unknown\n\nAmong the scholars, Moin has the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nNow, let's list the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin"

You are also told that Wei has an instant connection portal, through which he can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time. This means that once you connect with Wei, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we check his connections: Wim, Raj, Jing.\n2. Since Amir and Reza are no longer connected, we exclude Reza from further consideration.\n3. Now we need to utilize Wei's instant connection portal. We connect with Wei.\n4. From Wei, we can choose any scholar to connect with instantly. To reach the person with the maximum number of books, we need to determine who that is.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei and has a maximum of 0 books.\n   - Kim is connected to Wei and has a maximum of 0 books.\n   - Reza is excluded due to the disagreement with Amir.\n   - Moin is not directly connected to Wei.\n   - We already considered Amir, Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n   - Pari, Matt, Ian, Sara, Eva, Puja, and Pam are also not directly connected to Wei.\n5. From this analysis, we can conclude that the person with the maximum number of books is not directly accessible through Wei's instant connection portal.\n6. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is the same as the previous answer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin"
