You are also told that Wei has an instant connection portal, through which he can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time. This means that once you connect with Wei, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Amir -> Wei -> Moin (distance 3)\n2. Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Moin (distance 4)\n\nSince option 1 has a shorter distance, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, using Wei's connection portal, is:\n\nAmir, Wei, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Moin"
