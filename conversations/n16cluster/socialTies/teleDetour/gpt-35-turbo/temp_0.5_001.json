Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n5. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n6. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n7. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n8. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n9. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n10. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n11. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n12. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n13. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n14. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n15. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n16. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\nNow, let's find the person with the maximum number of books. We know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to either Moin or Matt. We can start by checking the immediate connections of Amir:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n\nNone of the immediate connections have a direct connection to Moin or Matt. We need to explore further connections.\n\n- Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n- Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n- Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n\nKim is connected to Moin, so we can consider Moin as a possible candidate for the person with the maximum number of books. We will continue exploring the connections from Kim.\n\n- Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n\nMatt is connected to Ian, so we can consider Matt as the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Matt) is:\n\nAmir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari, Matt."
