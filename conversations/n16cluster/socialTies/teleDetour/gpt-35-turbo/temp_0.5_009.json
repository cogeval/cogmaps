Create a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent scholar for each visited scholar.\n6. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n7. Set the maximum number of books to 0.\n8. Set the person with the maximum number of books to None.\n9.
