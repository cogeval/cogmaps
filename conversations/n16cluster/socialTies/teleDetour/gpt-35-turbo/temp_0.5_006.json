Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore the connections in a breadth-first manner until we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the current scholar and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current scholar.\n   - If the current scholar has the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add the current scholar to the visited set.\n   - For each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited, add them to the queue along with the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and no scholar with the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
