Since Moin is donating the most books, we will find the shortest path to Moin.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from Amir, we will explore each connected scholar until we reach Moin. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Explore each of them.\n3. Wim is connected to Raj, Jing, Eva, and Amir (already visited). Skip Wim.\n4. Raj is connected to Wim, Jing, Wei, and Amir (already visited). Skip Raj.\n5.
