We will keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar and find the scholar with the maximum number of books among those reachable from Amir. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue for the BFS traversal.\n2. Create a distance dictionary to keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar, with initial distance values set to infinity.\n3. Set Amir's distance to 0, as it is the starting point.\n4. Enqueue Amir to the queue.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has a greater number of books than the current maximum number of books found. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   c. For each connection of the current scholar, do the following:\n      i. Check if the connected scholar's distance is still infinity (indicating it hasn't been visited yet).\n      ii.
