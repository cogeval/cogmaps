Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start by creating a queue and adding Amir to it. Then, we will iterate through the queue, checking each person's connections and adding them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet. We will also keep track of the number of books each person has.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty visited set and add Amir to it.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each person has, initialized with 0 for all scholars.\n4. Create a variable max_books and set it to 0.\n5. Create a variable shortest_path and set it to an empty list.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a person from the queue and assign it to the variable current_person.\n   - Check if the current_person has more books than max_books:\n     - If yes, update max_books to the number of books the current_person has.\n     - If yes, update shortest_path to the path from Amir to the current_person.\n   - Iterate through the connections of the current_person:\n     - If a connected person has not been visited:\n       - Add the connected person to the visited set.\n       - Add the connected person to the queue.\n       - Update the number of books the connected person has by adding the number of books the current_person has.\n7.
