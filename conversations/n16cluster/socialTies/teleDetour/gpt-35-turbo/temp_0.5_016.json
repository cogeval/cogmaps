Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the distance from Amir and the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar and initialize it with Amir as the starting point and a distance of 0.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has and initialize it with Amir having 0 books.\n4. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Explore the connections of the dequeued scholar.\n   - For each connected scholar not yet visited, do the following:\n     - Calculate the distance from Amir to the connected scholar by adding 1 to the distance of the dequeued scholar.\n     - Update the number of books for the connected scholar by adding the number of books of the dequeued scholar.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n     - Update the distance dictionary and the books dictionary with the new distance and number of books for the connected scholar.\n6. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n7. Trace back the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books using the distance dictionary.\n8. Return the list of scholar names in order, including Amir.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin"
