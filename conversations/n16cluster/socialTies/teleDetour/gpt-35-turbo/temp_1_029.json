Then, we can find the person with the maximum number of books among those reachable from Amir. Let's start by creating a graph representing the connections between scholars.\n\nGraph:\nAmir -> [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\nWim -> [Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva]\nRaj -> [Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei]\nJing -> [Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam]\nWei -> [Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj]\nNisha -> [Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara]\nReza -> [Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei]\nKim -> [Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin]\nIan -> [Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt]\nMoin -> [Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara]\nPuja -> [Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin]\nSara -> [Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha]\nPari -> [Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja]\nPam -> [Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva]\nMatt -> [Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian]\nEva -> [Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim]\n\nNow, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n\nBFS from Amir:\nQueue: [Amir]\nVisited: {Amir}\nDistance: {Amir: 0}\n\n1. Visit Amir -> Distance from Amir to Amir: 0\n2. Visit Wim -> Distance from Amir to Wim: 1\n3. Visit Raj -> Distance from Amir to Raj: 1\n4. Visit Jing -> Distance from Amir to Jing: 1\n5. Visit Reza -> Distance from Amir to Reza: 1\n6. Visit Eva -> Distance from Amir to Eva: 2\n7. Visit Wei -> Distance from Amir to Wei: 2\n8. Visit Nisha -> Distance from Amir to Nisha: 3\n9. Visit Kim -> Distance from Amir to Kim: 3\n10. Visit Moin -> Distance from Amir to Moin: 4\n11. Visit Ian -> Distance from Amir to Ian: 5\n12. Visit Puja -> Distance from Amir to Puja: 6\n13. Visit Sara -> Distance from Amir to Sara: 6\n14. Visit Pari -> Distance from Amir to Pari: 7\n15. Visit Pam -> Distance from Amir to Pam: 2\n16. Visit Matt -> Distance from Amir to Matt: 8\n\nNow, we can see that Matt is the farthest scholar reachable from Amir with a distance of 8. Since Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books, the person with the maximum number of books reachable from Amir is Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Moin"
