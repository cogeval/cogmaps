Start from Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n   Queue: [Amir]\n   Visited: [Amir]\n   Books: {Amir: 0}\n\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. Add them to the queue.\n   Queue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\n   Visited: [Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza]\n   Books: {Amir: 0}\n\n3. Move to Wim. Since Wim is already visited, skip it.\n\n4. Move to Raj. Since Raj is already visited, skip it.\n\n5. Move to Jing. Since Jing is already visited, skip it.\n\n6. Move to Reza. Since Reza is already visited, skip it.\n\n7.
