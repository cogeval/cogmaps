Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each person, keeping track of the shortest path to each person and their respective number of books. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n   - Queue: [Amir]\n   - Visited: {Amir}\n\n2. Create an empty dictionary to store the shortest path and the total number of books for each person. Initialize the values for Amir.\n   - ShortestPath: {'Amir': 'Amir'}\n   - BookCount: {'Amir': 0}\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-8.\n\n4. Dequeue the first person from the queue.\n\n5. Check if the person has more books than the current maximum book count. If so, update the maximum book count and the person with the maximum books.\n\n6. Iterate through all the connections of the current person.\n\n7. For each connected person, if they have not been visited:\n   - Add them to the queue.\n   - Mark them as visited.\n   - Update their shortest path with the current person.\n   - Update their total number of books by adding the books from the current person.\n     - If the person does not have any books, use the current person's total number of books.\n   - Repeat step 5 to check if the connected person has more books than the current maximum book count.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue is empty.\n\n9. The final shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books will be stored in the ShortestPath dictionary. Return the shortest path.\n\nApplying these steps to the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara"
