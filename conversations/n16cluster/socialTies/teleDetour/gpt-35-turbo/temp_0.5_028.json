Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Since Wim, Raj, and Jing are connected to Amir, we will consider them next.\n4. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n5. Since Raj and Jing are already visited, we will skip them.\n6. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n7. Since Jing is already visited, we will skip her.\n8. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n9. Since Pam is not visited yet, we will consider her next.\n10. Check Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n11.
