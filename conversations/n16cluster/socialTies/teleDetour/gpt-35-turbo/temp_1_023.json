Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

List the scholars and their connections based on the given information:\n   - Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza\n   - Wim: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva\n   - Raj: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei\n   - Jing: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam\n   - Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj\n   - Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara\n   - Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei\n   - Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin\n   - Ian: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt\n   - Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara\n   - Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin\n   - Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha\n   - Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja\n   - Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva\n   - Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian\n   - Eva: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim\n\n2. Create a queue to store the scholars for the breadth-first search. Initialize the queue with Amir.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated. Initialize the dictionary with Moin's donation of 50 books and Matt's donation of 10 books.\n4. Create a dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each scholar. Initialize the dictionary with the path from Amir to itself.\n5. Implement the breadth-first search algorithm:\n   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n     - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n     - Check if the dequeued scholar has donated more books than the current maximum donation. If yes, update the maximum donation and the scholar with the maximum donation.\n     - For each connected scholar not already visited, add them to the queue, update their donation count, and update the shortest path to them.\n     - Mark the dequeued scholar as visited.\n6.
