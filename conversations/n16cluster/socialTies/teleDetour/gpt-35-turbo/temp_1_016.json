Start from Amir with a distance of 0 and no books.\n2. Check all the scholars connected to Amir (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza). Update their distances from Amir and the number of books they have.\n3. From Wim, we can go to Eva, who has the maximum number of books (10). Record the shortest distance and the books collected so far.\n4.
