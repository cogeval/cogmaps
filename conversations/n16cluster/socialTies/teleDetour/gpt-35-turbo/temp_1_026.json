From these connections, we see that Amir is indirectly connected to Eva and Wei through Wim and Raj, respectively.\n\nLooking at the connections related to book donations, we know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Since we want to find the person with the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin or Matt.\n\nLet's start with Amir and examine the connections:\n\n- Amir is directly connected to Wim.\n- Wim is directly connected to Eva.\n- Eva is indirectly connected to Pari.\n- Pari is directly connected to Matt.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari, Matt"

We know that Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj, who are also connected to other scholars. \n\nConsidering the connection portal, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books becomes:\n\nAmir, Wim, Eva, Pari, Matt (using the existing connections)\nor\nAmir, Wei (through the connection portal), any scholar connected to Wei (connecting to the scholar with the maximum number of books)\n\nSince we need to find the shortest path, and Wei has an instant connection portal, we can take advantage of that to directly connect to the scholar with the maximum number of books. However, without further information about the exact number of books donated by each scholar, we cannot determine the exact scholar with the maximum number of books in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books using Wei's connection portal is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei"
