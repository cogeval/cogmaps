Start with Amir and initialize a queue with his name and distance 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated books.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar, along with their distance from Amir.\n   - Mark the current scholar as visited.\n3.
