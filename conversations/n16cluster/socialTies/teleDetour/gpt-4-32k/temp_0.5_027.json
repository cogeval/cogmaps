Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

In this case, Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Therefore, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, I need to map out the connections from Amir to Moin. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. I need to find which of these scholars is connected to Moin.\n\nFrom the information given, Reza is connected to Amir, but not to Moin. Wim is connected to Amir, but not to Moin. Raj is connected to Amir, but not to Moin. Jing is connected to Amir, but not to Moin.\n\nTherefore, I need to find a scholar who is connected to both Amir and Moin. Kim is connected to both Moin and Reza, and Reza is connected to Amir. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."
