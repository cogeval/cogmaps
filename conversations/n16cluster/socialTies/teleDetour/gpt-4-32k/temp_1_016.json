Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nSecond, we have to determine the shortest path from Amir to Moin. Considering the connections:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n- Wim, Raj and Jing don't have direct or indirect connections with Moin.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n- Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n\nFollowing this path, the shortest connection from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books (Moin) is Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin."

You are also told that Wei has an instant connection portal, through which he can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time. This means that once you connect with Wei, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

However, we know that Wei has an instant connection portal and can connect to any scholar.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza (but Reza is no longer a viable option).\n- From these, Raj is connected to Wei.\n- Wei, through his portal, can immediately connect us to Moin, who has the maximum books.\n\nSo, the new shortest path from Amir to Moin, considering the updated connections, would be through Wim or Jing to Raj, then Wei, and finally to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin."
