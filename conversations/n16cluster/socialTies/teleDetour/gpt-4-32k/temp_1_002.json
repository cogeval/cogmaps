Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Moin is directly connected with Reza and Amir is also directly connected to Reza.\n5. Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"

We know that Wei has an instant connection portal, so he can immediately connect you to any scholar. \n4. From the previous scenario, we know that the person with the maximum number of books is Moin. Hence, we want to reach Moin in the shortest path.\n5. Moin is not directly connected with Amir, Wim, Raj, or Jing, but he can be instantly reached from Wei. \n6. Wei is directly connected to Raj, who is connected to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, given the changed circumstances, is Amir to Raj, Raj to Wei, and Wei directly to Moin through the connection portal. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
