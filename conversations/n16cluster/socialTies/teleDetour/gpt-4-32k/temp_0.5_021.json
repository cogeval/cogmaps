We can use the connections given to trace the path. \n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n\nOut of these, Reza is directly connected to Kim. \n\nAnd Kim is directly connected to Moin. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
