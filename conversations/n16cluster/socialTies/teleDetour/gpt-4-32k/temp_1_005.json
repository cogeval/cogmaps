Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Start at Amir\n2. Move to Wim (Amir's connection)\n3. Move to Eva (Wim's connection)\n4. Move to Matt (Eva's connection)\n5. Finally, move to Moin (Matt's connection)\n\nThis path allows Amir to reach Moin, who has the maximum number of books, in the shortest number of steps. \n\nFinal Answer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Moin."
