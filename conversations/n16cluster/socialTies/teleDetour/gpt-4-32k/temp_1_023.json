Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Out of these connections, Wim is the only one connected to Eva.\n4. Eva is connected to Matt.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin, who has 50 books) is not directly possible. However, if we want to reach the person with the next maximum number of books (Matt, who has 10 books), the path would be:\n\n1. Amir to Wim.\n2. Wim to Eva.\n3. Eva to Matt.\n\nHence, the scholar names in order are Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt"
