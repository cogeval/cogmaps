Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the above, only Wim and Raj can connect Amir to Moin.\n3. Wim is connected to Eva, but Eva does not have a connection to Moin.\n4. Raj is connected to Wei, but Wei also does not have a connection to Moin.\n5. Hence, Amir cannot directly reach Moin via his immediate connections.\n\nNext, we need to find a path from Amir's connections to Moin:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt. However, Matt doesn't have a connection to Moin.\n2. Raj is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Kim. Kim is connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"

This means that once you connect with Wei, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n2. From these, Raj is connected to Wei.\n3. Wei can connect to any scholar, so Wei can connect to Moin directly.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
