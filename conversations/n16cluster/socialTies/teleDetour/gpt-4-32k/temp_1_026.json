Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here is a step by step breakdown:\n\n1. From the information given, we know that Moin has the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\n2. To get from Amir to Moin with as few transitions as possible, I'll need to look at Amir's direct connections, then see if any of them are directly connected to Moin.\n\n3. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\n4. Among those, Raj is directly connected to Wei who is in turn directly connected to Moin.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"

Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is now directly connected to Wim, Raj, and Jing (but not Reza).\n\n2. Because Wei now has an instant connection portal, he can connect to any other scholar. Thus, if we can get to Wei, we can get directly to Moin.\n\n3. Among Amir's direct connections, Raj is connected to Wei.\n\n4. Once at Wei, we can use the connection portal to get directly to Moin.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Moin, avoiding Reza, and using Wei's connection portal is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
