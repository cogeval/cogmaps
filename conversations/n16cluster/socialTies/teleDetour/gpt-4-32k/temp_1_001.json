Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I'll start with Wim and see that Wim is not directly connected to Moin.\nNext, I'll look at Raj and see that Raj is also not directly connected to Moin.\nAfter that, I'll check Jing's connections, but Jing isn't connected to Moin either.\nFinally, I'll examine Reza's connections and I find that Reza is connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Reza, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Moin"

However, Wei has an instant connection portal that can link Amir to any scholar.\n\nThe new shortest path would involve:\n1. Amir reaching out to one of his direct connections that can connect him to Wei.\n2. Amir then using Wei's instant connection portal to connect with Moin, who has the most books.\n\nLooking at Amir's connections, we have Wim, Raj, and Jing. Wei is directly connected with Raj.\n\nSo, the new shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
