Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Here, Moin has the maximum books i.e., 50. \n\nStep 1: Identify Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Check if Moin is directly connected to any of these scholars. Moin is connected to Kim, Ian, Puja, and Sara. None of these connections are a match.\n\nStep 3: Identify the second degree connections from Amir via the four mentioned scholars. \n\n- Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva. \n- Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n- Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n- Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n\nAgain, none of these includes Moin.\n\nStep 4: Identify the third degree connections starting with Amir. Reza is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

None of these scholars have a direct or indirect connection with Moin.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that Wei can connect to any scholar instantly. Wei is connected to Raj, who is connected to Amir.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, given the condition of Wei's instant connection portal, is: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
