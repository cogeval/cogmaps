Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We are supposed to find the shortest path from Amir to the person donating the maximum books. In this case, it's Moin. \n\nStep 2: Review the connections from Amir - Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 3: Review the connections from these four and find a connection to Moin. From the provided connections, the following scholars are directly connected to Moin - Kim and Sara.\n\nStep 4: Check if Wim, Raj, Jing, or Reza is connected to Kim or Sara. From the provided connections, Wim is not connected to either Kim or Sara. Raj is not connected to Kim but is connected to Wei, who is connected to Kim. Jing is not connected to Kim or Sara. Reza is connected to Kim.\n\nStep 5: Based on this information, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Reza and Kim. Therefore, the sequence of scholars, starting from Amir, is Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
