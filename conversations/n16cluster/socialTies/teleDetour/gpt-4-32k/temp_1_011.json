Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The person with maximum books is Moin, with 50 books. Therefore, we're finding the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\n1. The first step is to see who Amir is directly connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Then, I will check to see which of these four are directly connected to Moin. However, none of them are.\n3. The next step is to look one step further. Wim is connected to Eva, Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Moin. This makes the path Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Moin. This is the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the scholars names in order, starting from Amir, are Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Moin."

You are also told that Wei has an instant connection portal, through which he can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time. This means that once you connect with Wei, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The first step is to see who Amir is directly connected to, excluding Reza due to their disagreement. This leaves Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n2. Since none of these three are directly or indirectly connected to Moin now, we should use Wei's instant connection portal.\n3. To access Wei's portal, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Wei. From Amir, we can get to Wei via Raj, making the path: Amir -> Raj -> Wei.\n4. After accessing Wei's portal, we can directly connect to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order are Amir, Raj, Wei, and Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin."
