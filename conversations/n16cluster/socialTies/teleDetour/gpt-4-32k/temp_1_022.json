Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nOut of the people Amir is connected to, Wim and Jing are the ones who can lead us to someone who has books. Wim is connected to Eva who is connected to Matt (who has 10 books), but that's a longer path. On the other hand, Jing is connected to Pam who is connected to Pari, who is connected to Puja, and Puja is directly connected to Moin (who has 50 books).\n\nConsidering the path through Jing is shorter, the shortest path from Amir to Moin would be: Amir -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari -> Puja -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Pari, Puja, Moin"

Since Wei has the instant connection portal and Moin has the maximum number of books, the shortest path would likely involve connecting to Wei first, then directly to Moin.\n\nAmir is connected to Raj, who is connected to Wei. From Wei, we can directly connect to Moin thanks to the instant connection portal.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) would now be: Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Moin"
