Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

None of them is directly connected to Moin, who has the maximum number of books. Let's see the connections of each of these scholars:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, who is connected to Ian, who is connected to Moin. So, the path would be Amir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian -> Moin.\n\n2. Raj is connected to Wei, but Wei is not connected to Moin or any scholar who is connected to Moin.\n\n3. Jing is connected to Pam, but Pam is not connected to Moin or any scholar who is connected to Moin.\n\n4. Reza is connected to Kim, but Kim is not connected to Moin or any scholar who is connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Wim, Eva, Matt, and Ian.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin"
