Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Based on the provided information, I understand that you're looking for the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering that you can only take books from one person.\n\nTo determine the shortest path, we can use a shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, in this scenario, we need to consider the condition that we can only take books from one person. Therefore, we need to modify the algorithm to account for this constraint.\n\nHere's an updated response using a modified BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering the constraint of only taking books from one person:\n\n```python\ndef bfs(graph, source, max_books):\n    # Initialize distances to all vertices as infinity except for the source vertex which is set to 0\n    distances = [float('inf')] * len(graph)\n    distances[source] = 0\n\n    # Create a queue to store the vertices to be processed\n    queue = []\n\n    # Add the source vertex to the queue\n    queue.append(source)\n\n    # Process the vertices in the queue\n    while len(queue) > 0:\n        current = queue.pop(0)\n\n        # Visit all neighbors of the current vertex\n        for neighbor in range(len(graph[current])):\n            neighbor_index = graph[current][neighbor]\n            if neighbor_index != source:\n                # Update the distance to the neighbor if it's shorter than the current distance\n                if distances[neighbor_index] > distances[current] + 1:\n                    distances[neighbor_index] = distances[current] + 1\n\n                    # Add the neighbor to the queue\n                    queue.append(neighbor_index)\n\n    # Find the vertex with the maximum number of books\n    max_books_vertex = None\n    max_books_distance = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the distances and find the vertex with the maximum number of books\n    for vertex, distance in enumerate(distances):\n        if distance == max_books_distance:\n            max_books_vertex = vertex\n            break\n\n    # If the maximum number of books is not found, return None\n    if max_books_vertex is None:\n        return None\n\n    # Construct the path from the source vertex to the maximum number of books vertex\n    path = [source]\n    current = max_books_vertex\n\n    while current !="
