We will traverse the graph, starting from Amir and moving through the connections until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's perform the BFS algorithm step-by-step to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check if any of Amir's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n4. Move to the next level of connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n5. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. Check if any of Wim's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n7. Move to the next level of connections: Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n8. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n9. Check if any of Raj's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n10.

Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n18. Check if any of Nisha's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n19. Move to the next level of connections: Reza, Kim, Sara.\n20. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n21. Check if any of Reza's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n22. Move to the next level of connections: Kim.\n23. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n24. Check if any of Kim's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n25. Move to the next level of connections: Moin.\n26. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n27. Check if any of Moin's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n28. Move to the next level of connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n29. Check Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n30. Check if any of Ian's connections have the maximum number of books. We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n31. Move to the next level of connections: Puja, Sara, Matt.\n32. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n33.

We don't have this information yet, so we continue with the BFS.\n40. Move to the next level of connections: Matt, Eva.\n41. Check Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n42. Check if any of Matt's connections have the maximum number of books. Matt has 10 books, which is the maximum number we know so far. We stop the BFS here.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Kim, Moin, Matt"
