Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar until we reach the person with the maximum number of books. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Move to the next level and check the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n4. Among the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza, check if any of them have connections to scholars with more books.\n5. If yes, choose the scholar with the most books and add them to the path.\n6. If no, move to the next level and check the connections of the scholars at the current level.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n8. Once we reach the person with the maximum number of books, stop the search and list the scholars in the path from Amir to that person, including Amir.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Amir\n2. Wim (connected to Amir)\n3. Wei (connected to Wim)\n4. Nisha (connected to Wei)\n5. Sara (connected to Nisha)\n6. Ian (connected to Sara)\n7. Moin (connected to Ian)\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Ian, Moin"
