We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar level by level until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Queue Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza in the BFS queue.\n4. Explore Wim. Since Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva, queue Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n5. Explore Raj. Since Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei, queue Jing and Wei.\n6. Explore Jing. Since Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam, queue Pam.\n7. Explore Reza. Since Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei, queue Kim and Nisha.\n8. Explore Eva. Since Eva is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Pam, queue no new scholars.\n9. Explore Wei. Since Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj, queue Nisha and Kim.\n10. Explore Pam. Since Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva, queue Pari and Matt.\n11. Explore Kim. Since Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin, queue Moin.\n12. Explore Nisha. Since Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara, queue Sara.\n13. Explore Moin. Since Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara, we have found the person with the maximum number of books.
