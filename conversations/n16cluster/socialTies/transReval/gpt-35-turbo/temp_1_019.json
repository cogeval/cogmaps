Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore the network of connections, keeping track of the number of books each person has donated.\n\n1. Set up a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the maximum number of books seen so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Check if the scholar has any connections who haven't been visited yet. If yes, enqueue those connections, update their number of books donated, and add them to the dictionary.\n6. After the breadth-first search, the scholar with the maximum number of books will be in the variable holding the maximum number of books.\n7. To find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, follow these steps:\n   - Starting from the scholar with the maximum number of books, keep track of the previous scholar visited during the breadth-first search.\n   - Traverse back to Amir, storing each scholar visited along the way.\n   - Reverse the order of the scholars visited to get the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara, Matt"
