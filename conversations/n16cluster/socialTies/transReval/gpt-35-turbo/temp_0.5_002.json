Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize the distance from Amir to all other scholars as infinity, except for Amir itself, which is 0.\n3. Create a priority queue to store the scholars based on their distances.\n4. Start with Amir and set its distance as 0. Add Amir to the priority queue.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Pop the scholar with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current scholar, calculate the distance from Amir through the current scholar.\n   - If the calculated distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n6.
