Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Initialize the distance to all scholars (except Amir) as infinity.\n\n3. Initialize the distance to Amir as 0.\n\n4. Create an empty set called \"visited\" to keep track of scholars whose shortest path has been found.\n\n5. While there are still unvisited scholars, do the following:\n\n   - Select the unvisited scholar with the minimum distance. Let's call this scholar \"current\".\n\n   - Mark \"current\" as visited.\n\n   - For each neighbor of \"current\" that is not in the visited set, calculate the tentative distance from Amir to the neighbor. If this distance is smaller than the current distance assigned to the neighbor, update the distance.\n\n6. Repeat step 5 until all scholars have been visited.\n\n7.
