Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start by creating a queue and adding Amir to it. Then, we will iterate through the queue until it is empty, exploring each scholar's connections and adding them to the queue. We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has. Finally, we will select the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books for Amir to 0.\n6. Set the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n    - If the scholar has not been visited:\n        - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n        - If the scholar has more books than the current maximum:\n            - Update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n        - Iterate through the scholar's connections:\n            - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n                - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n                - Update the number of books for the connected scholar by adding the number of books from the current scholar.\n                - Update the path from Amir to the connected scholar.\n8. Return the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Moin"
