Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the distance from Amir and the cumulative number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it. Also, initialize a dictionary to keep track of the distance and cumulative number of books for each scholar.\n\n2. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person with maximum books.\n   - Explore the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar is not visited:\n       - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n       - Update the distance and cumulative number of books for the connected scholar.\n       - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n\n3. After traversing all the scholars, we will have the scholar with the maximum number of books and the distance from Amir to that scholar.\n\nNow, let's implement the above steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
