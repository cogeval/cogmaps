Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n3. Initialize variables to keep track of the current shortest path and the person with the maximum number of books.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current person with the maximum number of books. If yes, update the current person with the maximum number of books.\n   - Check if the scholar is connected to any other scholars who have not been visited yet. If yes, enqueue those scholars into the queue and add them to the visited set.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the queue is empty.\n5.
