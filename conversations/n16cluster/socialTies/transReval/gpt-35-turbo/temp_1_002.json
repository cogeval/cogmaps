Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We'll start from Amir and explore each of his connections, and continue exploring their connections until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Explore each of Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. For each connection, check if they have the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path.\n4. If not, add each connection to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each person in the queue until the queue is empty.\n\nLet's follow this process and determine the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari"
