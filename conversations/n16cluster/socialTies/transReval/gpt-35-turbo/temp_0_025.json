We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Wim: Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Check the connections of each of the connections from step 3:\n   - For Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing's connections: Wim, Raj, Amir, Pam.\n   - For Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n   - For Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n   - For Pam's connections: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n   - For Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n   - For Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n   - For Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n   - For Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - For Pari's connections: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Matt's connections: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n5.
