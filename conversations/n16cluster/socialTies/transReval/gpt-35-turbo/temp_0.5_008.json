Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - For each connected scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Update the number of books donated by the connected scholar based on the current scholar's donation.\n7. Once the queue is empty, we will have the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha"
