Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Moin is donating 50 books, he currently has the maximum number.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Moin, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, check the connections.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Among these connections, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books (Moin).\n4. Continue checking the connections from the chosen person until we reach Moin.\n\nBased on the connections, we can determine the shortest path from Amir to Moin with the maximum number of books as follows:\n\nAmir, Reza, Kim, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

Among the remaining connections, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books.\n4. Since Moin is still connected to Kim, and Moin has the maximum number of books, the path remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is still:\n\nAmir, Reza, Kim, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
