We will continue this process until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - If the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n   - Update the number of books donated by each connected scholar.\n7.
