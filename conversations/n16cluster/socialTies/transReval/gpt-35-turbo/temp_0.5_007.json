Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore all the connected scholars, keeping track of the distance from Amir to each scholar. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable `max_books` to 0 and a variable `max_books_scholar` to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has more books than `max_books`, update `max_books` and `max_books_scholar`.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - Mark the current scholar as visited.\n5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Moin"
