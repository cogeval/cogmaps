Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore the connections of each scholar and keep track of the number of books they have donated. We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir and mark it as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books and set it to 0.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the scholar with the maximum number of books and set it to None.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - Mark each connected scholar as visited.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the queue is empty.\n7. The scholar with the maximum number of books is the final outcome.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Pari"
