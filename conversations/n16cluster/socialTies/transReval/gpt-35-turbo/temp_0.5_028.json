Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start by creating a graph representation of the connections between the scholars. Then, we will perform a breadth-first search starting from Amir, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars:\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n   - Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n   - Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Jing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n   - Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei.\n   - Kim is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n   - Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt.\n   - Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara.\n   - Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin.\n   - Sara is connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha.\n   - Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva.\n   - Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian.\n   - Eva is connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim.\n\n2. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has the maximum number of books among all visited scholars, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the scholar and mark them as visited. Update the number of books each neighbor has based on the donations.\n\n4. If no scholar with the maximum number of books is found, return an appropriate message.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Pari"
