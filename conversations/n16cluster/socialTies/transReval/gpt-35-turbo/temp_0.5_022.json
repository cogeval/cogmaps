Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore each scholar's connections in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir has any connections who have more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n3. Add Amir to the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the removed scholar has any connections who have more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n   - Add all the connections of the removed scholar to the queue (if they are not already visited).\n5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty or the person with the maximum number of books is found.\n6. Once the person with the maximum number of books is found, backtrack from that person to Amir to find the shortest path.\n7.
