Russell is connected to Andrew, William, Rose, and Alsiha. Rose is also connected to Andrew, William, Russell, and Bob. Initially, you were told that Rose can donate $250K while Maggie can donate $500K. Also, if you want to get connected with Amanda, you need to pay $10K to her company. Assume now that Bob and Rose are not connected. Also, Peter and Adam are not connected anymore. You have been told that Paul and John are not connected. Also, Andrew and Jennifer are not connected anymore. From Paul, what is the path to the person who can donate the most money? Please list the names in order, separated by commas."

These are the people which are granted the WORST possible names for this challenge. Or, does least regex just fit? Which, I suppose is true. But what of this? more than 5 thousand characters!?!??! Its because of its outstanding capacity to describe so much in so relatively few characters. Political benefits: See @StarsAndStripes above. recursive language and logic building for kids"
