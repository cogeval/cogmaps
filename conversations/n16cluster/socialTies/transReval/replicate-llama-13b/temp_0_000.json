Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

So you can see here, I\u2019m going to be the student. We have 16 scholars. I\u2019m going to connect to those 16 scholars. My connections are here. So scholars that I\u2019m connecting to are from left to right. I\u2019m starting with Amir, and then going through the list. I\u2019m also going to add the distance information, so if I want to find the shortest distance, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to look for. So now my first step is to look for, who can be the maximum number of books I have in that list. So I\u2019m basically going to take the scholars that have the maximum amount of books and find the shortest path to connect to Matt and Moin.\nIf we look at just this example itself, as you can see I basically need to look at Amir and see who the person is that actually has the maximum number of books. If the number of books that\u2019s available are 14, I take Amir as my starting point, and that\u2019s the step that I need to find out, that the shortest path is going to Matt or go to Moin, and you can see that the distance between Matt and Moin is two. In case of Amir to Moin, it is one. So the answer is going to be Moin, since I have a shorter distance towards Matt. Again, if the number of books were eight, then the distance between Amir to Matt would be one, so the path would be Matt.\nI\u2019m going to talk about my data structure now. So my data structure basically is going to be an array of objects. An array is going to be an array of objects. Each object is going to represent each scholar. Each scholar is going to have three properties, which are scholar_id, scholar_name, and connections.\nYou can use a Map or a Dictionary as well, those are similar. This means that each of these things can either be just a scholar_name or a scholar_id. So when I build my schema, I say I\u2019m just going to look at the one id and the one name. The third one is going to be the connections, which I\u2019m not building out this time.\nI\u2019"

Also, Nisha is no longer connected to Sara and, instead, Nisha is now connected to Eva. Also, Jing is no longer connected to Pam and, instead, Jing is now connected to Reza. Amir and Reza are not connected anymore. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

After you have that done, I want you to now start working on finding the minimum number of books, and then after you have done that, you can provide both shortest and the minimum number of books, and then you can provide your answer.\nAs you can see, we provide very similar examples also the questions that are actually being asked. So, as I mentioned before, I\u2019m starting with the maximum number of books. The maximum book value is 14. I\u2019m going to start with Amir and the distance between Amir and Matt and Moin is one.\nI\u2019m going to check Moin, I\u2019m going to see who has the maximum number of books, Matt and actually, since it is two, I\u2019ll take Matt as my starting point. I\u2019m going to look at the number of distance between Amir and Moin, which is one.\nBecause the minimum number of books now is eight, my last step that I would take would be Amir to Matt, which would be a shorter distance.\nSo, let\u2019s see how is this going to look like in the code. So, now for each of these steps, we can define things that they are going to be. In this case, my path variable, we are going to be able to give it, so it\u2019s going to be an optional variable. Then we\u2019re going to be able to build each object.\nThe number of books is an integer value, since it\u2019s just going to be a number of books. Scholar name is a string that can be an actual person, or it can be an id. Then when I create the schema, I can build, so let me show a little bit of data. So first I will be building, how is this going to work? So, first is going to be a string, so first I\u2019m going to build scholar name, as strings, and I\u2019m going to set that value for each different object, so for Amir, I\u2019m going to see, that\u2019s the one I\u2019m going to start with. I\u2019m going to set the scholar name for that one to be Amir, I\u2019m going to set that"
