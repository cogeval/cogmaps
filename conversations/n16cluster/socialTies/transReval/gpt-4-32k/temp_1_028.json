Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

According to the information given, Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Thus, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, to find the shortest path to Moin from Amir, we need to look at who each scholar is connected to:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nFrom these options, Jing is the only one who can make a connection to a scholar who is connected to Moin. Jing is connected to Pam. Pam is connected to Matt and Matt is connected to Ian. Finally, Ian is connected to Moin.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person (Moin) with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Jing, Pam, Matt, Ian, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Matt, Ian, Moin."
