Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n\nStarting with Wim, Wim is connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva. But Eva is not connected to Moin, who has the maximum books. \n\nNext, Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. However, Wei is not directly connected to Moin. \n\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Pam is not connected to Moin. \n\nFinally, Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Among these, Kim is also connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin, who has the maximum books, is through Reza and Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
