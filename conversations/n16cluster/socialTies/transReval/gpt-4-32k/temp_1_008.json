Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Wei is not connected to Moin, but Kim is.\n- Kim is connected to Moin. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

(Reza is removed from Amir's list)\n- Wim is now connected to Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, and Sara. (Eva is removed and Sara is added to Wim's list)\n- Raj, as before, is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n- Jing is now connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Reza. (Pam is removed and Reza is added to Jing's list)\n- Reza is connected to Kim, Nisha, and Wei. (Amir is removed from Reza's list)\n- Kim, as before, is connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin.\n- Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj.\n- Nisha is now connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Eva. (Sara is removed and Eva is added to Nisha's list)\n- Sara is now connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Wim. (Nisha is removed and Wim is added to Sara's list)\n- Moin, Puja, Pari, Pam, Matt, Eva, and Ian's connections remain the same.\n\nSince Moin is the person with maximum books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. \n\n- Neither Wim nor Raj have a direct or indirect connection to Moin.\n- Jing is connected to Reza, and Reza is connected to Kim. Kim, in turn, is connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin after these updates is: Amir -> Jing -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Reza, Kim, Moin"
