Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. None of these four scholars are directly connected to Moin. Therefore, we need to find who among these four can reach Moin in the shortest path.\n3. Looking at the connections, Wim can reach Moin through Matt and Eva; Reza can reach Moin through Nisha and Kim; Jing and Raj have no direct or indirect connection to Moin.\n4. The shortest path is through Wim (Amir - Wim - Matt - Moin), which will take three steps.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Matt, Moin."

Therefore, we need to find who among these three can reach Moin in the shortest path.\n3.
