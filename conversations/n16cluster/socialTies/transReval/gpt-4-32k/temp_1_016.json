Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Moin has the most books, so the goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. \n\nStep 1: Identify all direct connections for Amir. These include Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether Moin is directly connected to any of these scholars. Moin is not directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, or Reza.\n\nStep 3: Check the next level of connections for each of Amir's connections. Moin is directly connected to Kim, and Kim is directly connected to Reza.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir to Reza to Kim to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"

These include Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether Moin is directly connected to any of these scholars. Moin is not directly connected to Wim, Raj, or Jing.\n\nStep 3: Check the next level of connections for each of Amir's connections. Moin is directly connected to Kim, and Kim is directly connected to Reza. But Amir and Reza are no longer connected.\n\nStep 4: Since Reza is now connected to Jing, and Amir is still connected to Jing, the path can go through Jing.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir to Jing to Reza to Kim to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Reza, Kim, Moin"
