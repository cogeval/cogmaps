Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Moin is the one with the maximum number of books, however, the task requirement is to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum books, which is Moin. \n\nIn this scenario, the shortest path leads us to Matt, who is donating fewer books, but we have to ignore this, as the task clearly states that we have to take books only from one person and that person should have the maximum books.\n\nTherefore, even though the path is longer, the correct answer should be the path to Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin."
