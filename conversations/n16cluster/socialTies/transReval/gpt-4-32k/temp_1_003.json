Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

According to the given data, Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books, meaning Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Moin:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. None of them are directly connected to Moin, so we need to go one level further.\n3. Looking at the scholars connected to Amir's connections, we see that Raj is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Kim.\n5. Finally, Kim is connected to Moin.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is through Raj, Wei, Kim, to Moin. \n\nSo the list of scholars in order will be Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin."

Also, Nisha is no longer connected to Sara and, instead, Nisha is now connected to Eva. Also, Jing is no longer connected to Pam and, instead, Jing is now connected to Reza. Amir and Reza are not connected anymore. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Among Amir's connections, Wim is connected to Sara. \n3. Sara is connected to Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is through Wim and Sara. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Sara, Moin."
