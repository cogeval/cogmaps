Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

These are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Since Moin has the maximum books (50 books), we need to find the shortest path to Moin. First, check if Moin is directly connected to any of the scholars identified in Step 1. He is not. \n\nStep 3: Now, look at the scholars who are connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of these scholars are directly connected to Moin.\n\nStep 4: Continue this process by looking at the scholars connected to those identified in step 3. We find that Moin is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Reza, who is directly connected to Amir.\n\nStep 5: Having identified the shortest path, list the scholars in order: Amir, Reza, Kim, and Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
