Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, Moin is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. This is a network problem, and by checking the connections among the scholars, we can find the shortest path. \n\nStarting from Amir, the connections are:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. Among these, Wim and Reza are connected to other scholars, but they are not connected to Moin. \n3. Raj is connected to Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. None of these, except Amir, have a direct connection with Moin.\n4. Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. None of these, except Amir, have a direct connection with Moin.\n\nTherefore, none of Amir's direct connections provide a quick path to Moin. \n\nHowever, Reza is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Moin. \n\nHence, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is: Amir -> Reza -> Kim -> Moin. \n\nSo, the sequence of scholar names from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
