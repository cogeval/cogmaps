Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books, Matt is donating 10 books and Pari is not donating any book. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.
