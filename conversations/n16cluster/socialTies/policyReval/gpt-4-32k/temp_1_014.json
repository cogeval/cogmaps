Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We need to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the most books, that's Moin.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the connections. We know that Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. None of them is Moin, so we need to look for secondary connections.\n\nStep 3: Among Amir's connections, both Wim and Raj are connected to another person. Wim is connected to Eva and Raj is connected to Wei.\n\nStep 4: Reviewing the scholars connected to Eva and Wei, we see that Kim is the common connection, who is linked to Moin.\n\nStep 5: Putting the shortest path together, we get: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin."
