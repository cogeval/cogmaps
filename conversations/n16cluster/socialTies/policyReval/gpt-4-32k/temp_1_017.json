Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Since Moin has the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path to him.\n2. Looking at the connections, the shortest path to Moin starting from Amir seems to be: Amir - Raj - Wei - Kim - Moin\n3.
