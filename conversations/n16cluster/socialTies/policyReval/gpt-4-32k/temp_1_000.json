Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books, Matt is donating 10 books and Pari is not donating any book. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas. "

Wim is connected to Eva, Raj is connected to Wei, Jing is connected to Pam, and Reza is connected to Wei.\nStep 3: Identify the connections from step 2 (Eva, Wei, Pam, and Wei) and find their connection to Moin, Matt, or Pari. Eva is connected to Pari and Matt. Wei is connected to Nisha and Raj, who is already part of the path. Pam is connected to Pari. Since Moin has the most books, we want to find the shortest path to Moin.\nStep 4: Examine the remaining connections of Eva (Pari and Matt). Neither is connected to Moin, so go to Wei's connections (Nisha and Raj). Nisha is connected to Moin.\nStep 5: Trace the shortest path back to Amir. The path is Amir -> Reza -> Wei -> Nisha -> Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha, Moin"
