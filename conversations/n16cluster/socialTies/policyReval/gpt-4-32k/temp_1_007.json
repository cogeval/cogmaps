Since Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10, Moin has the maximum number of books. Therefore, I have to find the shortest path from Amir to Moin. \n\nAmir is directly connected with Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. But none of these four are connected to Moin. Therefore, we need to find a scholar who is connected to Moin and is in direct connection with one of the four scholars mentioned above. \n\nFrom the information given, Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Among these four scholars, only Kim is directly connected to one of the scholars that Amir is directly connected to. Kim is directly connected to Reza. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Moin will pass through Reza and Kim. \n\nSo, the scholar names in order should be Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Kim, Moin"
