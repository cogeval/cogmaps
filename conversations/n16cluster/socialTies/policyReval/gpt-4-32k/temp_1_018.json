Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, Moin has the most books (50), compared to Matt's 10.\n2. Begin at Amir, and identify the connections to Moin. Notice that Amir does not have a direct connection to Moin, therefore, we must find a sequence of connections that lead to Moin.\n3. Trace the shortest path through connections from Amir to Moin. An effective method may involve analyzing the persons Amir is connected to, and then determining which of these connections lead closest to Moin. \n\nAfter mapping the connections, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is:\n\nAmir -> Wim -> Eva -> Matt -> Ian -> Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt, Ian, Moin"
