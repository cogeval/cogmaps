Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We begin with Amir. From Amir, we have a direct connection to Raj. \n\n2. From Raj, we have a direct connection to Wei.\n\n3. From Wei, we have a direct connection to Kim. \n\n4. Finally, from Kim, we have a direct connection to Moin.\n\nThis is the shortest path to Moin (who has the maximum number of books) starting from Amir. \n\nTherefore, the sequence of scholars from Amir to Moin is:\n\nAmir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Kim, Moin"
