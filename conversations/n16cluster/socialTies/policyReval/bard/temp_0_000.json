Jing is also connected to Amir, Wim, Raj, and Pam. Wei is connected to Nisha, Reza, Kim, and Raj. Nisha is connected to Wei, Reza, Kim, and Sara. Reza is connected to Amir, Kim, Nisha, and Wei. Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I started by finding the scholars who have the most books. There are two scholars with the most books: Moin (50 books) and Kim (40 books).\n2. I then found the shortest path from Amir to each of the scholars with the most books. The shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir, Wim, Raj, Kim. The shortest path from Amir to Kim is Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim.\n3. Since the shortest path from Amir to Moin is shorter, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books from Amir is Amir, Wim, Raj, Kim.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
