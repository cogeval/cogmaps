We first find all of the scholars who are connected to Amir. These are Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n2. We then find the scholar who is connected to the most of these scholars and has the most books to donate. This is Pari, who is connected to Amir and has 100 books to donate.\n3. We then find the shortest path from Amir to Pari. This path is Amir, Pari.\n4. We then list the scholars in order, starting from Amir. This list is Amir, Pari.\n\nThe regular expression you provided is:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words.
