Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Set the distance of Amir to 0 and add Amir to the visited set.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   2. For each connected scholar of the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n      1. Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n      2. Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n      3. Update the distance of the connected scholar as the distance of the dequeued scholar plus 1.\n      4.
