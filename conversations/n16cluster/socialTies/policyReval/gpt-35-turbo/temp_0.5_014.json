Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start by initializing a queue and a visited set. We will enqueue Amir and mark him as visited. Then, we will iterate over the queue until it is empty.\n\nAt each iteration, we will dequeue a scholar, check if they have the maximum number of books, and if so, we will return the path from Amir to that scholar. Otherwise, we will enqueue their connected scholars who have not been visited yet and mark them as visited. We will also keep track of the path from Amir to each scholar.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue and visited set.\n   - Queue: [Amir]\n   - Visited: {Amir}\n\n2.
