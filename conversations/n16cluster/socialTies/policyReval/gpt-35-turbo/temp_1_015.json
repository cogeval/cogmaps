Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We'll start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar while keeping track of the number of books they have donated. \n\nStarting from Amir, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add Amir to it.\n2. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the books donated by each scholar.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the connections of each scholar.\n4. Create an empty list to store the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Create an empty set to track the scholars that have been visited.\n6. Initialize the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Add Amir to the queue.\n2. Set the number of books donated by Amir to 0.\n3. Set the connection of Amir to an empty list.\n4. Set the shortest path from Amir to Amir as [Amir].\n5. Add Amir to the visited set.\n\nThe queue now contains Amir, and the visited set contains Amir.\n\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n     1.
