Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will traverse the network and keep track of the distances between each scholar. At the same time, we will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize the distance to 0 and the number of books to 0.\n2. Check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza) and add them to a queue with their respective distances and number of books.\n3. Remove Amir from the queue and process the next scholar.\n4. For each connected scholar, update their distance by adding 1 to the distance of the current scholar and update their number of books by adding the number of books donated by the current scholar.\n5. If the connected scholar has already been visited and their new distance is greater than or equal to the current distance, skip the scholar.\n6. If the connected scholar has not been visited or their new distance is less than the current distance, update their distance and number of books, and add them to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the queue is empty.\n8. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books and its distance from Amir.\n9. Backtrack from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir, following the distance and number of books recorded for each scholar.\n10. List the scholar names in order, starting from Amir, separated by commas.\n\nBased on the given connections and donations, let's calculate the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha"
