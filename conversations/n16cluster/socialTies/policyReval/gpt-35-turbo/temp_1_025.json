Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will visit each scholar in a breadth-first manner, meaning we will first explore all the connections of a scholar before moving on to the next level.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue to store the scholars to visit and a set to keep track of visited scholars.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated.\n4. Initialize the number of books donated from Amir as 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the maximum number of books encountered so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited connections of the scholar to the back of the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Update the number of books donated by the current scholar in the dictionary.\n6. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
