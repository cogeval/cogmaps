Kim is also connected to Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Moin. Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Sara, and Matt. Moin is connected to Ian, Puja, Kim, and Sara. Puja is connected to Pari, Ian, Sara, and Moin. Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will create a queue and initialize it with Amir. Then, we will traverse the connections of each scholar in the queue, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and initialize it with Amir.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books and initialize it to 0.\n5. Create a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books and initialize it to None.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark them as visited.\n   - Check if the number of books donated by the current scholar is greater than the maximum number of books:\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Traverse the connections of the current scholar:\n     - If a connected scholar has not been visited, enqueue them and update the number of books they have donated based on the current scholar's connections.\n7. Return the list of scholars in order, starting from Amir and including the scholar with the maximum number of books, separated by commas.\n\nBased on the given connections and book donations, we will perform the steps above to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books."
