Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We'll start from Amir and traverse through the connected scholars while keeping track of the number of books each scholar has. \n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the number of books each connected scholar has:\n    - Wim has no books.\n    - Raj has no books.\n    - Jing has no books.\n    - Reza has no books.\n4. Since none of the connected scholars have any books, we move on to the next level of connections.\n5. From Wim, check his connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, and Eva.\n6. Check the number of books each connected scholar has:\n    - Amir has no books.\n    - Raj has no books.\n    - Jing has no books.\n    - Eva has no books.\n7. Since none of the connected scholars have any books, we move on to the next level of connections.\n8.
