Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will iterate through the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the path and the total number of books at each step. \n\nStarting from Amir, the initial path is just \"Amir\" and the total number of books is 0. We will consider the connections of Amir - Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza. \n\n- For each connection, we will create a new path by appending the connected scholar's name to the current path and update the total number of books. We will also add this new path to a queue.\n\n- We will repeat this process until we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of books or until the queue becomes empty.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a queue.\n   - Add (\"Amir\", 0) to the queue (representing the starting point with 0 books).\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a path and total books from the queue.\n   - Check if the current scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, return the scholar name.\n\n3. Get the connections of the current scholar from the given information.\n\n4. For each connection, do the following:\n   - Create a new path by appending the connected scholar's name to the current path.\n   - Update the total number of books by adding the number of books the connected scholar has (if available).\n\n5. Enqueue the new path and total books to the queue.\n\n6. If no scholar with the maximum number of books is found, return \"No scholar with the maximum number of books found.\"\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books."
