Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check Wim's connections: Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva.\n4. Check Raj's connections: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n5. Check Jing's connections: Amir, Wim, Raj, Pam.\n6. Check Reza's connections: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n7. Check Wei's connections: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj.\n8. Check Nisha's connections: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n9. Check Kim's connections: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n10. Check Moin's connections: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n11. Check Ian's connections: Moin, Puja, Sara, Matt.\n12. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n13. Check Sara's connections: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n14.

Check Eva's connections: Pari, Pam, Matt, Wim.\n\nAt this point, we have explored all the connections starting from Amir. Now, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books among these scholars.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Therefore, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Moin, considering the number of books, is as follows:\n\nAmir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Sara, Moin"
