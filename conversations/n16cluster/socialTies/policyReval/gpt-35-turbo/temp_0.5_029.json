Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start with Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n4. Initialize the queue with Amir and add Amir to the visited set.\n5. Initialize the maximum number of books as 0 and the scholar with maximum books as None.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with maximum books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - Mark the current scholar as visited.\n7. Repeat step 6 until the queue is empty.\n8. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with maximum books.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha"
