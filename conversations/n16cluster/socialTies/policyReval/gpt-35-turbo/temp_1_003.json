Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize a queue to store the scholars to visit.\n2. Initialize a set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n4. Enqueue Amir to the queue.\n5. Set Amir's books count to 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is not in the visited set, do the following:\n      - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n      - If the scholar has more books than the maximum number of books seen so far, update the maximum number of books seen and the person with the maximum books.\n      - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited.\n      - Set the number of books each connected scholar has as the sum of the current scholar's books count and the number of books the connected scholar is donating.\n\n7.
