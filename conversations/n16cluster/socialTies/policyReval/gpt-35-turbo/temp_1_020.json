Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

We will start from Amir and explore his connections, considering each connection as a possible path to the person with the maximum number of books. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir as the current scholar and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to the previous scholar.\n5. Create a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n6. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books, initially set to 0.\n7. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current scholar.\n   - Mark the current scholar as visited by adding it to the visited set.\n   - If the current scholar has more books than the maximum number of books:\n     - Update the maximum number of books with the current scholar's books count.\n     - Set the scholar with the maximum number of books to the current scholar.\n   - For each connection of the current scholar that has not been visited:\n     - Add the connection to the queue.\n     - Mark the connection as visited.\n     - Add the path from the current scholar to the connection in the path dictionary.\n8. Trace back the path from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the path dictionary.\n9. Output the list of scholars in the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Nisha, Sara"

Start with Amir as the current scholar and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4.
