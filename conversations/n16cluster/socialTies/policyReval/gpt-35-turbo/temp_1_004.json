Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Start with Amir.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to store the previous scholar in the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n6. Set the distance of Amir to 0.\n7. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n    - Mark the scholar as visited.\n    - For each scholar connected to the current scholar, do the following:\n        - If the scholar has not been visited, enqueue the scholar.\n        - Update the distance from Amir to the scholar if it is smaller than the current distance.\n        - Update the previous scholar in the shortest path if the distance has been updated.\n8. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books from the set of visited scholars.\n9. Traverse the previous scholar dictionary from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir to find the shortest path.\n10.
