Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books.

We will start from Amir and explore each connected scholar, keeping track of the distance from Amir and the number of books each scholar has. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored. Add Amir to the queue.\n2. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n3. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n4. Set the distance of Amir to 0 and the number of books Amir has to 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has not been visited before, add the scholar to the dictionary of distances and the dictionary of books.\n   c. If the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   d. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar that have not been visited before.\n   e. Update the distance and the number of books for each connected scholar.\n6. Starting from Amir, follow the path to the scholar with the maximum number of books by selecting the connected scholar with the shortest distance and the maximum number of books.\n7.
