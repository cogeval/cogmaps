We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar in a breadth-first manner until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of Amir's connections:\n   - For Wim: Raj, Jing, Eva.\n   - For Raj: Wim, Jing, Wei.\n   - For Jing: Wim, Raj, Pam.\n   - For Reza: Amir, Kim, Nisha, Wei.\n4. Check the connections of each of the above connections and continue exploring until we find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - For Eva: Wim, Raj, Jing, Pari, Pam, Matt.\n   - For Wei: Nisha, Reza, Kim, Raj, Moin.\n   - For Pam: Jing, Pari, Matt, Eva.\n   - For Kim: Wei, Nisha, Reza, Moin.\n   - For Nisha: Wei, Reza, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Moin: Ian, Puja, Kim, Sara.\n   - For Pari: Pam, Matt, Eva, Puja.\n   - For Matt: Pari, Pam, Eva, Ian.\n   - For Sara: Ian, Moin, Puja, Nisha.\n   - For Puja: Pari, Ian, Sara, Moin.\n5. Determine the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Moin is donating 50 books.\n   - Matt is donating 10 books.\n   - Therefore, Moin has the maximum number of books.\n6.
