Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We'll keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar as we traverse the graph.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to visit.\n2. Create a set to keep track of the scholars already visited.\n3. Initialize the queue with Amir as the starting point.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_books` to 0 and a variable `max_books_scholar` to None to keep track of the person with the maximum number of books.\n5. Start the BFS algorithm:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books donated than the current `max_books`. If yes, update `max_books` and `max_books_scholar`.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited yet, add them to the visited set.\n   - Enqueue all the connections of the scholar (excluding the visited ones) into the queue.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the queue is empty or until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's follow these steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Nisha"

Now, we'll use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering the updated book donations.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Create a priority queue to store the scholars based on the number of books they have donated.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the shortest distance from Amir to each scholar.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the previous scholar in the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n4. Initialize the priority queue, distance dictionary, and previous dictionary.\n5. Set the distance of Amir to 0 in the distance dictionary and add Amir to the priority queue.\n6. Start the Dijkstra's algorithm:\n   - Dequeue the scholar with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books donated than the current maximum number of books.\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n   - Check if the scholar has been visited before. If yes, continue to the next iteration.\n   - Update the distances of the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   - If the updated distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance dictionary and the previous dictionary.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars into the priority queue.\n7. Repeat step 6 until the priority queue is empty.\n\nLet's follow these steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering Pari's donation of 100 books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pari"
