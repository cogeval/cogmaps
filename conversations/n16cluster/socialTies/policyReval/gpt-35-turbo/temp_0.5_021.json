Sara is also connected to Ian, Moin, Puja, and Nisha. Pari is connected to Pam, Matt, Eva, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Pari, Matt, and Eva. Matt is connected to Pari, Pam, Eva, and Ian. Eva is also connected to Pari, Pam, Matt, and Wim. You have been told that Moin is donating 50 books and Matt is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person.

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections and keep track of the distance from Amir. We will also keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable `max_books` to 0 and a variable `max_books_scholar` to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited.\n   - If the scholar has donated more books than `max_books`, update `max_books` and `max_books_scholar`.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited connections of the scholar into the queue.\n5. Return the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's apply this process to the given group of scholars:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Kim, Moin, Ian, Puja, Sara"
