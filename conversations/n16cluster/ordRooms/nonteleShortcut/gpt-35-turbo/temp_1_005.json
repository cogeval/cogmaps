Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest distance to all other rooms and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a distance and reward array for all rooms. Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and the reward of room 10 and 15 to 50 and 10, respectively. Set the reward of all other rooms to 0.\n    - distance = [0, float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), 50, float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), 10, float('inf')]\n    - reward = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 50, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0]\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms and initialize it with all rooms.\n    - unvisited = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}\n\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty, do the following:\n\n    3.1. Find the unvisited room with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.\n    \n    3.2. For each of the neighboring rooms that are still unvisited, calculate the distance and reward of the path through the current room, and update the distance and reward arrays accordingly if the new path is shorter and more rewarding than the previous path.\n\n4. Once all rooms have been visited, the distance and reward arrays contain the shortest distances and maximum rewards from room 1 to all other rooms. We can trace back the path with the highest reward by starting from room 1 and following the neighboring room with the highest reward until we reach room 10 or 15.\n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 15"
