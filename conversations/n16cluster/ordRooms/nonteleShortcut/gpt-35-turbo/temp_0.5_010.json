In this case, it is room 3 with a distance of 1.\n\n| Room | Distance from 1 | Previous Room |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| 1    | 0              | None          |\n| 2    | 1              | 1             |\n| 3    | 1              | 2             |\n| 4    | 1              | 2             |\n| 5    | 2              | 1             |\n| 6    | 3              | 1             |\n| 7    | 1              | 1             |\n| 8    | 2              | 1             |\n| 9    | infinity       | None          |\n| 10   | 3              | 1             |\n| 11   | infinity       | None          |\n| 12   | 3              | 16            |\n| 13   | 4              | 12            |\n| 14   | 4              | 12            |\n| 15   | 4              | 12            |\n| 16   | 2              | 1             |\n| 17   | 4              | 12            |\n\n8. We visit the neighbors of room 3 and update their distances in the table if they are shorter than the current distance. We also update their previous room to be room 3.\n\n| Room | Distance from 1 | Previous Room |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| 1    | 0              | None          |\n| 2    | 1              | 1             |\n| 3    | 1              | 2             |\n| 4    | 1              | 2             |\n| 5    | 2              | 1             |\n"
