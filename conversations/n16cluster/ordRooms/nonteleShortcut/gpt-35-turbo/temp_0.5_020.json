Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a table of all the rooms and their distances from room 1. Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and all other distances to infinity. Also, create a table of all the rooms and their rewards.\n\n```\nRoom | Distance | Reward\n-----|----------|-------\n  1  |    0     |   0\n  2  |   inf    |   0\n  3  |   inf    |   0\n  4  |   inf    |   0\n  5  |   inf    |   0\n  6  |   inf    |   0\n  7  |   inf    |   0\n  8  |   inf    |   0\n  9  |   inf    |   0\n 10  |   inf    |  50\n 11  |   inf    |   0\n 12  |   inf    |   0\n 13  |   inf    |   0\n 14  |   inf    |   0\n 15  |   inf    |  10\n 16  |   inf    |   0\n```\n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the distance from room 1 to that neighboring room (the distance from the current room to the neighboring room plus the distance from room 1 to the current room) and update the table of distances if the new distance is shorter than the current distance. Also, if the new distance is shorter than the current distance and the neighboring room has a higher reward than the current maximum reward, update the maximum reward.\n\n```\nRoom | Distance | Reward\n-----|----------|-------\n  1  |    0     |   0\n  2  |    1     |   0\n  3  |    1     |   0\n  4  |    1     |   0\n  5  |    2     |   0\n  6  |    3     |   0\n  7  |    1     |   0\n  8  |    3     |   0\n  9  |   inf    |   0\n 10  |    4     |  50\n 11  |   inf    |   0\n 12  |   inf    |   0\n 13  |   inf    |   0\n 14  |   inf    |   0\n 15  |    3     |  10\n 16  |    2     |   0\n```\n\n4.
