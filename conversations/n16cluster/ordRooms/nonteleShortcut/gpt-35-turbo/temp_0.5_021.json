Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The rewards for each chest are as follows: room 10 has a reward of 50 and room 15 has a reward of 10. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance from room 1 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0. Also, initialize the reward for each room as 0, except for rooms 10 and 15.\n\n2. Add all rooms to a priority queue based on their distance from room 1.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, take the room with the shortest distance from room 1.\n\n4. For each neighboring room that has not been visited yet, calculate the total reward if we were to collect the reward from that room and update the reward for that room if it is greater than the current reward.\n\n5. Update the distance for each neighboring room based on the distance to the current room plus the distance between the current room and the neighboring room.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we have visited all rooms or until we have visited room 10 or 15.\n\n7. If we have visited both rooms 10 and 15, choose the room with the higher reward. Otherwise, choose the room that we have visited with the highest reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 8, 10. The reward for this path is 50. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
