Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Assign a tentative distance of 0 to all rooms except for room 1 which is assigned a tentative distance of infinity.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance plus the reward of the chest in the adjacent room (if any). If this tentative distance is less than the adjacent room's current distance, update the adjacent room's distance to the tentative distance.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat step 3 and 4 until all rooms have been visited.\n\n6. Once all rooms have been visited, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 to any room can be obtained by starting from the destination room and following the path of smallest tentative distance until room 1 is reached.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is as follows:\n\n1 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThe total reward collected would be 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 10"
