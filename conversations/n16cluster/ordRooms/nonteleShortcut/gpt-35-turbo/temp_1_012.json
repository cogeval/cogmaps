Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward?

We can visit any of these rooms first. Let's say we choose Room 7. \n\nFrom Room 7, the reward of visiting Room 1 is 0, Room 5 is -15, Room 6 is 0, and Room 8 is 0. We can't visit Room 5 because of the penalty. We can visit either Room 1, Room 6, or Room 8. Let's say we choose Room 6. \n\nFrom Room 6, the reward of visiting Room 5 is -15, Room 7 is 0, Room 8 is 0, and Room 12 is 0. We can't visit Room 5 because of the penalty. We can visit either Room 7, Room 8, or Room 12. Let's say we choose Room 8. \n\nFrom Room 8, the reward of visiting Room 5 is -15, Room 6 is 0, Room 7 is 0, Room 10 is 10. We can't visit Room 5 because of the penalty. We can visit either Room 6, Room 7, or Room 10. Let's say we choose Room 10. \n\nFrom Room 10, the reward of visiting Room 8 is 0, Room 9 is 0, Room 11 is 0, and Room 12 is 0. We can visit any of these rooms. Since Room 9 is now connected to Room 16, which has the higher reward, we'll choose Room 9. \n\nFrom Room 9, the reward of visiting Room 10 is 10, Room 11 is 0, Room 12 is 0, and Room 15 is 0. We can visit Room 10 for the reward. \n\nFrom Room 10, the reward of visiting Room 8 is 0, Room 9 is 0, Room 11 is 0, and Room 12 is 0. We've already visited Room 9, so we can visit either Room 8, Room 11, or Room 12. Let's say we choose Room 12. \n\nFrom Room 12, the reward of visiting Room 6 is 0, Room 9 is 0, Room 10 is 0, and Room 11 is 0. We've already visited Room 9 and Room 10, so we'll choose Room 6 for the last step. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from Room 1 to Room 16 (via Room 9) is: 1, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 12, 6. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 12, 6."
