Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

In this case, the edge weights are the rewards and penalties associated with each room.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can initialize the distance to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0. We can also keep track of the predecessor of each room, which will help us reconstruct the path later.\n\nThen, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the next room to visit. Initially, the priority queue will contain only room 1. We can repeatedly extract the room with the smallest distance from the queue, and update the distances of its neighbors if necessary. We can also update the predecessors of the neighboring rooms.\n\nOnce we have visited room 16, we can reconstruct the path by following the predecessors back to room 1.\n\nHere is the path that yields the most reward:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 9, 16"
