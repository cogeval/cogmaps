Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we will compute the shortest path to each reachable room, taking into account the rewards and penalties. \n\nThe graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:\n\n1: [(2,0),(3,0),(4,0),(7,0)]\n2: [(1,0),(3,0),(4,0),(16,5)]\n3: [(1,0),(2,0),(4,0),(5,0)]\n4: [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(14,0)]\n5: [(6,-15),(7,0),(8,0),(3,0)]\n6: [(5,0),(7,0),(8,0),(12,0)]\n7: [(1,0),(8,0),(6,0),(5,0)]\n8: [(5,0),(6,0),(7,0),(10,0)]\n9: [(10,10),(11,0),(12,0),(15,0),(16,0)]\n10: [(9,10),(11,0),(8,0),(12,0)]\n11: [(13,0),(9,0),(12,0),(10,0)]\n12: [(9,0),(10,0),(11,0),(6,0)]\n13: [(14,0),(15,0),(16,5),(11,0)]\n14: [(4,0),(13,0),(15,0),(16,0)]\n15: [(13,0),(14,0),(16,0),(9,0)]\n16: [(13,0),(14,0),(15,0),(2,5),(9,0)]\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can compute the shortest path to each room, taking into account the rewards and penalties. We start with the source node (room 1) and compute the distance to each of its neighbors (rooms 2, 3, 4, 7). Then, we add the neighbor with the highest reward to the priority queue and repeat the process until we reach the destination node (room 16).\n\nHere is the sequence of steps for computing the shortest path:\n\n1. Starting from node 1\n2. Room 2 (reward = 0) -> distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n3. Room 3 (reward = 0) -> distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n4. Room 4 (reward = 0) -> distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n5. Room 7 (reward = 0) -> distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n6. Add room 2 to the priority queue\n7. Room 16 (reward = 5) -> distance = 0 + 5 = 5\n8. Room 9 (reward = 0) -> distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n9. Add room 9 to the priority queue\n10. Room 11 (reward = 0) -> distance = 10 + 0 = 10\n11. Room 10 (reward = 10) -> distance = 10 + 10 = 20\n12. Add room 10 to the priority queue\n13. Room 8 (reward = 0) -> distance = 20 + 0 = 20\n14. Room 6 (reward = 0) -> distance = 20 + 0 = 20\n15. Room 5 (reward = -15) -> distance = 20 - 15 = 5\n16. Room 12 (reward = 0) -> distance = 20 + 0 = 20\n17. Add room 5 to the priority queue\n18. Room 15 (reward = 0) -> distance = 5 + 0 = 5\n19. Room 14 (reward = 0) -> distance = 5 + 0 = 5\n20. Add room 14 to the priority queue\n21. Room 16 is reached\n22. Path with highest reward: 1, 2, 16\nAnswer: 1,\\s*2,\\s*16"
