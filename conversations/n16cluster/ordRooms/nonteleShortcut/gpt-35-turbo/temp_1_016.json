Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The reward in room 15 is 10.\n\nThere is no direct connection between room 1 and room 12, so we cannot reach room 17 directly from room 1. However, since room 12 is connected to all of its neighboring rooms, we can assume that room 17 is connected to room 12's neighboring rooms as well, including room 6.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 6 is: 1, 8, 6. The reward in room 6 is 0.\n\nThe shortest path from room 6 to room 12 is: 6, 12. The reward in room 12 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 17 (through rooms 6 and 12) is: 1, 8, 6, 12, 17. The reward in room 17 is unknown since it is a new room.\n\nSince we do not know the reward in room 17, we cannot determine if it is the highest reward. Therefore, the path with the highest known reward is the one that leads to room 10, and the order of rooms from room 1 to room 10 is 1, 8, 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 10."
