Assign a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except for room 1, which gets a tentative distance of 0. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n2. Set the current room to room 1. \n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to that room by adding the reward of the chest (if it exists) to the current room's tentative distance. If this tentative distance is less than the neighboring room's current tentative distance, update the neighboring room's tentative distance to this new value.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. From the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms left, terminate the algorithm.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 10 or room 15) is visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, which is the reward from the chest in room 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
