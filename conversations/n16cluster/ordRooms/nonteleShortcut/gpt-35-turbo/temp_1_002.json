Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can compute the shortest path to all other rooms and keep track of the total reward and penalty. \n\nThe shortest path to room 16 is 1 -> 2 -> 16, with a total reward of 5 and a total penalty of 0. The shortest path to room 10 is 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10, with a total reward of 10 and a total penalty of 0. The shortest path to room 5 is 1 -> 7 -> 5, with a total reward of 0 and a total penalty of 15. \n\nNow that room 16 is connected to room 9, we need to update our graph and recompute the shortest paths. Room 16 is now connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 9. The shortest path to room 16 is now 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 6 -> 12 -> 9 -> 16, with a total reward of 5 and a total penalty of 15. The shortest path to room 10 is still 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10, with a total reward of 10 and a total penalty of 0. The shortest path to room 5 is still 1 -> 7 -> 5, with a total reward of 0 and a total penalty of 15. \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10, with a total reward of 10 and a total penalty of 0. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
