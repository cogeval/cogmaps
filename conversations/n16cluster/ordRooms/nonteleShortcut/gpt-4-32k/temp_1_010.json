Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."
