Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The chest have coins, and room holds questions and a chest. Each question will take time to answer so you should not ask more than 15 questions total. The input size is limited to 100m characters (this is less than the size of a chest so you can store and pass data through the network).\nYou are given a list of questions. The number of the question is an index, so it runs from 1 to $100m - 1$ in the input. You are told that the first question corresponds to where I leave the key. I start at random position. Then I either move one cell into the left, up, down, or right and try to open the chest. If I open the chest, I collect the reward and start a game. If I fail, I start from the position I leave one more time. The problem is that we have limited number of cells, and we start at random location in the matrix. So I need to decide which random location is the best one to start in order to collect 33 gold and then give up.\nLet's start with the top-left coordinate. Here we could go 2 cells left first. If we succeed, then we have collected 32 gold, no matter where we would go. If we fail, we collect 64 gold by going 2 cells left, 2 cells up. So in the worst case we collect 81,280 gold. Note that we lose 33 gold on the first try, so our final outcome would be 28047 gold. This is the most we would collect and then give up. Now think if the chest was on the same row as our current position. In such case we could collect at most 64 gold, without moving from our current position. In the worst case we will be able to collect 30 gold, where we would move 9 cells down, 9 cells left and 9 cells up.\nNow let's think about a matrix that has a chest on a diagonal. Then if we start at the top-right coordinate"
