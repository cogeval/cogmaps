In this challenge, you have to think like a machine learning engineer. Here, you will be given a dataset of values and you have to predict a future value based on the previous values.\n\nYou are a data scientist working for a company. The company is using a weather forecasting model. The model is quite simple and takes the weather of the past 30 days as input. The weather in those 30 days is categorized as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy. Based on the previous weather and the type of weather it is sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy, the model predicts the weather for the next 30 days. The weather forecast for the next 30 days is sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.\n\nuser: Good morning, my name is 'Meteorologist'.\nMeteorologist: Thank you for calling. How can I help you?\nuser: I want to know what is the weather forecast for the next 30 days?\nMeteor"
