It has a three-step process. In the first step, it runs the regular expression and checks if there are any matches. If there are matches, it goes to the second step, where it starts collecting the matches. In the second step, it keeps on collecting the matches until it is finished. Once it is finished, it moves to the third step, where it starts matching the collected strings against the regular expression. It keeps on doing this until it has collected all the matches.\n\nNow, let us understand the difference between the two. In the first case, the engine will try to collect the matches until it has collected all the matches. In the second case, the engine will stop collecting the matches once it has found the last match.\n\nLet us now discuss the use of backtracking in regular expressions.
