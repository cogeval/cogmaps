Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You have been told that room 16 is now connected to room 9. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

We used Keras to build our model\nwe have also used code for model looping in condition we get large data set.\n\nOur main function imports headers for Keras tensorFlow TF1536, summation, time and free record. Keras tutorial has been taken as reference for our code.\n\nData loader is initialized like this.\ndata loader comes with 3 functions initialize, fit and predict. Please note that the data are always insert into data sets randomly, therefore , take intuition from pictures to build matrix M.\nData set can be either CSV (used in this program ) or XLM.\n\nArtificial Intelligent agent like Siri or Alexa uses sequence to sequence.Here we are going to check sequence to sequence.\n-Here is a code we built using tensor Flow (pretransformerly = numpyarray() )\ne = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence2d(data , match_length=whatever)\nnumpyarray="
