Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Assume now that rooms 2 and 16 are not connected. Also, rooms 6 and 12 are not connected anymore. You have been told that rooms 1 and 7 are not connected. Also, rooms 13 and 11 are not connected anymore. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by  commas."

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room while keeping track of the total reward or penalty along the way. We can stop calculating paths once we reach room 16, since that is our goal.\n\nUsing the updated connections, the graph looks like this:\n\n```\n1: 2, 3, 4\n2: 1, 3, 4\n3: 1, 2, 4\n4: 1, 2, 3, 14\n5: 6, 8\n6: 8\n7: 8\n8: 10\n9: 10, 15\n10: 9\n11: 14\n12: 9\n13: 14, 15, 16\n14: 13\n15: 13, 16, 9\n16: 13, 15\n```\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following rewards for each room:\n\n```\nRoom 1: reward 0\nRoom 2: reward 0\nRoom 3: reward 0\nRoom 4: reward 0\nRoom 5: penalty -15\nRoom 6: reward 0\nRoom 7: reward 0\nRoom 8: reward 0\nRoom 9: reward 0\nRoom 10: reward 10\nRoom 11: reward 0\nRoom 12: reward 0\nRoom 13: reward 0\nRoom 14: reward 0\nRoom 15: reward 0\nRoom 16: reward 5\n```\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: `1, 4, 14, 13, 16`. \n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16"
