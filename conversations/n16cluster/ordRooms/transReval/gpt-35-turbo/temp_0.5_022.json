Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, Visited, and Previous. Initialize the table with Distance = infinity for all rooms except for Room 1, which has Distance = 0. Visited and Previous columns can be initialized as null for all rooms.\n\n2. Starting from Room 1, visit the neighboring rooms (Rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7) and update their Distance values to the rewards in those rooms (0 for Room 1, 50 for Room 10, 10 for Room 15) and their Previous values to Room 1.\n\n3. Select the unvisited room with the smallest Distance value (Room 4 with Distance = 1) and visit its neighboring rooms (Rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14). Update their Distance values to the rewards in those rooms plus the Distance value of Room 4 (1 for Rooms 1, 2, and 3, 60 for Room 14) if the sum is smaller than their current Distance values. Update their Previous values to Room 4.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until all rooms have been visited.\n\n5. To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, start from Room 1 and follow the Previous values until you reach either Room 10 or Room 15. Compare the rewards in those rooms and choose the one with the higher reward.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is: 1, 4, 14, 13, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 13, 15."
