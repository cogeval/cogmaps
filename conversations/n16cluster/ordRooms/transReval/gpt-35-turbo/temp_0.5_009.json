Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Assume now that rooms 2 and 16 are not connected. Also, rooms 6 and 12 are not connected anymore. You have been told that rooms 1 and 7 are not connected. Also, rooms 13 and 11 are not connected anymore. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by  commas."

Starting from room 1, we will calculate the shortest path to all other rooms while keeping track of the total reward or penalty along the way. Here is the list of connections after the changes:\n\nRoom 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 4\nRoom 2 is connected to rooms 1, 3, 4\nRoom 3 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 4, 5\nRoom 4 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, 14\nRoom 5 is not connected to any room\nRoom 6 is not connected to any room\nRoom 7 is not connected to any room\nRoom 8 is connected to rooms 10\nRoom 9 is connected to rooms 10, 15\nRoom 10 is connected to rooms 8, 9, 11\nRoom 11 is not connected to any room\nRoom 12 is not connected to any room\nRoom 13 is not connected to any room\nRoom 14 is connected to rooms 4, 15, 16\nRoom 15 is connected to rooms 9, 14, 16\nRoom 16 is connected to rooms 14, 15\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following path from room 1 that yields the most reward: 1, 4, 14, 15, 16. The total reward for this path is 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 10. Note that we avoid room 5 to avoid the penalty. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 15, 16"
