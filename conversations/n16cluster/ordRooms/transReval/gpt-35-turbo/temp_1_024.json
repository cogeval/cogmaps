Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Assume now that rooms 2 and 16 are not connected. Also, rooms 6 and 12 are not connected anymore. You have been told that rooms 1 and 7 are not connected. Also, rooms 13 and 11 are not connected anymore. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by  commas."

            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward, we can use a graph search algorithm. First, we need to update the graph based on the given changes. The updated graph is as follows:\n\nRoom 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 4.\nRoom 2 is connected to rooms 1, 3, 4.\nRoom 3 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 4 and 5. \nRoom 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14.\nRoom 5 is connected to rooms 6, 8, and 3.\nRoom 6 is only connected to rooms 5, 7, and 8.\nRoom 7 is only connected to room 8.\nRoom 8 is only connected to rooms 5, 7, and 10.\nRoom 9 is connected to rooms 10, 12, and 15.\nRoom 10 is connected to rooms 9, 12, and 8.\nRoom 11 is only connected to room 13.\nRoom 12 is only connected to room 9.\nRoom 13 is only connected to rooms 14 and 15.\nRoom 14 is connected to rooms 4 and 15.\nRoom 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, and 9.\nRoom 16 is only connected to rooms 14 and 15.\n\nWe can use the A* search algorithm with a heuristic of the remaining reward to find the path that yields the most reward. We start at room 1, and the remaining reward is 5 (for room 16). The path with the most reward can be found as follows:\n\n1 -> 4 (reward = 5, remaining reward = 10) -> 14 (reward = 18, remaining reward = 5) -> 15 (reward = 23, remaining reward = 0) -> 9 (reward = 33, remaining reward = 10) -> 10 (reward = 43)\n\nSo the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 4, 14, 15, 9, 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 15, 9, 10"
