Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Room 2 has a chest with a reward of 0, so we can eliminate it from consideration. We can go to room 3, which has a chest with a reward of 0 as well, so we eliminate it too. We can then go to room 4, which has a chest with a reward of 0 as well, so we eliminate it too. Finally, we can go to room 7, which has a chest with a reward of 0 as well, so we eliminate it too.\n\nWe now have to choose between two paths that lead to rooms with rewards. We can go to room 5, which has a chest with a reward of 0, or we can go to room 8, which has a chest with a reward of 50. Since we can only collect the reward once and we want the most reward, we choose to go to room 8.\n\nFrom room 8, we can go to room 10, which has a chest with a reward of 50, or we can go to room 5, which has a chest with a reward of 0. We choose to go to room 10 to collect the reward of 50.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 8, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 10"
