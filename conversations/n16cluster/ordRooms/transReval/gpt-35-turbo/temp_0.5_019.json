Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Assign a tentative distance to every room, with the distance to room 1 being 0 and the distance to all other rooms being infinity.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms that have not been visited. Calculate their tentative distances, which is the sum of the current room's distance and the reward of the chest in that neighboring room.\n5. If any of the neighboring rooms have a smaller tentative distance than their current distance, update their distance.\n6. Mark the current room as visited.\n7. If the destination room (either room 10 or room 15) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat from step 4.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThe reward collected will be 50, which is the maximum reward possible. \n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 10"
