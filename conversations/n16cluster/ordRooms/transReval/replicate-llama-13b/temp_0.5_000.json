Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

So let the possible rooms where we collect loot be M={14,16}. And I want yo establish edges between rooms which means we cant leave items we must first possess or go to rooms that are prerquisities and these edges are double edge connections i e order pairs(rooms) for our topology where every room room x' says 'H can preed to room y if(i or else its predecosrs x-y dooest permits going through any edges or room preceeding 'x.'
