Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

She needs a program that she can feed some moves, and then the program will complete the game without any further assistance from her.\nUse data and a program, described below, to play a game of noughts and crosses against the computer.\nThere are N rows and M columns in an NxM chess board. There are B pieces, each of which occupies one intersection of a row and one intersection of a column.\nStarting from the first row, the computer chooses one intersection of a row and one intersection of a column and places a piece there. Similarly, then the computer places a piece in a randomly chosen intersection of a row and one intersection of a column. If the board is covered by a piece of either piece, the current position is a winning one (a piece captures its opponent if it is the only piece in its row or column). If not, proceed to check the position on the next row.\nThe grandmaster wants the computer to continue playing until there are no more winning positions left or until it has made a non-trivial number N of moves at once (otherwise it would be too easy for her to beat the computer). What is the minimal number of moves a computer needs to make to ensure that it will beat the grandmaster if they play the game an infinite number of times? Please submit answers separately; one answer for each player/computer, respectively.\nThe problem here is that the winning criteria are not defined. Also, 'trivial number (of moves)' makes no sense: each move should be considered a 'trivial number of moves'\nThe computer's only goal is to ensure that it will win if they play an infinite number of times. How does it do it?\nYou have been hired by a multinational bank. There is a system called the bank manager which controls all transactions and withdrawals within the bank. Today the bank has detected several irregularities within the system. It is suspected that some malicious software is involved and that some unauthorised user(s) are currently able to access the system. Before the software developers are able to conduct an inquiry into the situation, they need to make a decision with regard to"
