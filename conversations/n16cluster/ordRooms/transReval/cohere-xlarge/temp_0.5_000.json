Nowadays, this has become much easier. There are some websites that you can use to make your own text or image recognition. One of these websites is Google Cloud Vision. On this website, you can upload images and Google Cloud Vision will return the result as a list of words. This can be very useful for recognizing words on a document or in a picture. The code that I have used for this is:\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/how-to/identify-object-in-image>\n\nThis is the URL of the Google Cloud Vision website. It has a lot of different functions. The one that I used is the \"Label Detection\""

Instead, you can have the chatbot only reply to certain messages. This is called the \"intent\". When you create a chatbot, you can set up the intents for each message. For example, if you say \"Hello\" to the chatbot, it can reply \"Hello, how are you?\". If you say \"I want to talk to you\", it can reply \"Ok, let's talk\".\n\nThis is called a \"conversational chatbot\". The chatbot will only reply to certain messages. This is a very useful way to make a chatbot. It can also be used to make"
