Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 8. Initially, set the distance of room 8 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance from 8 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | Infinity        |\n| 2    | Infinity        |\n| 3    | Infinity        |\n| 4    | Infinity        |\n| 5    | Infinity        |\n| 6    | Infinity        |\n| 7    | Infinity        |\n| 8    | 0               |\n| 9    | Infinity        |\n| 10   | Infinity        |\n| 11   | Infinity        |\n| 12   | Infinity        |\n| 13   | Infinity        |\n| 14   | Infinity        |\n| 15   | Infinity        |\n| 16   | Infinity        |\n\n2. Mark room 8 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 8, update its distance to the sum of the distance to room 8 and the distance between the two rooms. For example, the distance from room 8 to room 5 is 1, so update the distance of room 5 to 1.\n\n| Room | Distance from 8 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | Infinity        |\n| 2    | Infinity        |\n| 3    | Infinity        |\n| 4    | Infinity        |\n| 5    | 1               |\n| 6    | Infinity        |\n| 7    | Infinity        |\n| 8    | 0               |\n| 9    | Infinity        |\n| 10   | Infinity        |\n| 11   | Infinity        |\n| 12   | Infinity        |\n| 13   | Infinity        |\n| 14   | Infinity        |\n| 15   | Infinity        |\n| 16   | Infinity        |\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 8. In this case, it is room 5.\n\n5. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n6. For each room adjacent to room 5 that is unvisited, update its distance to the sum of the distance to room 5 and the distance between the two rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance from 8 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | Infinity        |\n| 2    | Infinity        |\n| 3    | 2               |\n| 4    | Infinity        |\n| 5    | 1               |\n| 6    | 2               |\n| 7    | 2               |\n| 8    | 0               |\n| 9    | Infinity        |\n| 10   | 3               |\n| 11   | Infinity        |\n| 12   | 3               |\n| 13   | Infinity        |\n| 14   | Infinity        |\n| 15   | Infinity        |\n| 16   | Infinity        |\n\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 8. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n8. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n9. For each room adjacent to room 7 that is unvisited, update its distance to the sum of the distance to room 7 and the distance between the two rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance from 8 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | 3               |\n| 2    | 4               |\n| 3    | 2               |\n| 4    | 4               |\n| 5    | 1               |\n| 6    | 2               |\n| 7    | 2               |\n| 8    | 0               |\n| 9    | Infinity        |\n| 10   | 3               |\n| 11   | Infinity        |\n| 12   | 3               |\n| 13   | Infinity        |\n| 14   | Infinity        |\n| 15   | Infinity        |\n| 16   | 5               |\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 8. In this case, it is room 6.\n\n11. The shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is 2, since the distance from room 8 to room 6 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is:\n\nAnswer: 8,5,6"
