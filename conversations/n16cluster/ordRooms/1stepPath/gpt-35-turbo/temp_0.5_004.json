            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 2. Initially, set the distance of room 2 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | inf      |\n| 10   | inf      |\n| 11   | inf      |\n| 12   | inf      |\n| 13   | inf      |\n| 14   | inf      |\n| 15   | inf      |\n| 16   | inf      |\n```\n\n2. Mark room 2 as visited and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16) to their distances from room 2 (which is 1 in all cases). Also, mark room 1 as the previous room of these neighbors, since the shortest path to them goes through room 1.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | inf      |\n| 10   | inf      |\n| 11   | inf      |\n| 12   | inf      |\n| 13   | inf      |\n| 14   | inf      |\n| 15   | inf      |\n| 16   | 1        |\n\n| Room | Previous |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 2        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 1) and repeat step 2 for its neighbors (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | 2        |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | inf      |\n| 10   | inf      |\n| 11   | inf      |\n| 12   | inf      |\n| 13   | inf      |\n| 14   | inf      |\n| 15   | inf      |\n| 16   | 1        |\n\n| Room | Previous |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 2        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n```\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until all rooms are visited. The final table is:\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 2        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | 4        |\n| 10   | 2        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | 3        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 2        |\n| 16   | 1        |\n\n| Room | Previous |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 2        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 10   | 8        |\n| 14   | 4        |\n| 8    | 7        |\n| 15   | 13       |\n| 11   | 10       |\n| 12   | 6        |\n| 6    | 5        |\n| 9    | 10       |\n| 13   | 11       |\n```\n\n5. To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 1, we can backtrack from room 1 to room 2 using the \"Previous\" column in the table. The path is: 2, 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: `Answer: 2, 1`"
