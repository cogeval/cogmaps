Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 2, and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark room 2 as the current room.\n3. For each room adjacent to the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room (2) to that room, by adding the distance between the current room and the adjacent room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance for that room, update the tentative distance.\n4. When all adjacent rooms have been processed, mark the current room as visited.\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the current room. If there are no unvisited rooms, stop.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (16) has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 2 to room 16: 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 12, 9, 15, 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 12, 9, 15, 16."
