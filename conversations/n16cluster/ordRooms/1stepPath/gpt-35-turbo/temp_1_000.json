While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next room and check if it is room 2. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop. Otherwise, add all the unvisited rooms connected to the current room to the queue and mark them as visited.\n3. If we finish searching the entire graph without finding room 2, then there is no path from room 1 to room 2.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 2 is:\n\n1, 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2"
