Starting from room 8, we can calculate the shortest distance to each of the connected rooms, and then continue the process until we reach room 6. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance to room 8 as 0, and the distance to all other rooms as infinity.\n2. Consider all rooms connected to room 8 (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10). Calculate the distance from room 8 to each of these rooms, and update their distance accordingly. The updated distances are: room 5 - 1, room 6 - 1, room 7 - 1, room 10 - 1.\n3. Among the connected rooms, choose the one with the shortest distance. In this case, it is room 5.\n4. Consider all rooms connected to room 5 (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8). Calculate the distance from room 8 to each of these rooms, by adding the distance from room 8 to room 5 (which is 1) to the distance from room 5 to each of these rooms (which can be found in step 2). The updated distances are: room 3 - 2, room 6 - 2, room 7 - 2, room 8 - 1.\n5. Among the connected rooms that haven't been visited yet, choose the one with the shortest distance. In this case, it is room 8 (which was already visited, but we need to update its distance).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until we reach room 6. The updated distances at each step are:\n\n- Step 4: room 3 - 2, room 6 - 2, room 7 - 2, room 8 - 1.\n- Step 5: room 6 (which has a distance of 2).\n- Step 6: we have reached room 6, so we can stop.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is: 8, 5, 6.\n\nAnswer: 8, 5, 6."
