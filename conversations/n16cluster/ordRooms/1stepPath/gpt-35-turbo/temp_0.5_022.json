Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for Room 16 and to infinity for all the other rooms.\n2. Set Room 16 as the current room and create a set of visited rooms.\n3. For each of the current room's neighbors, calculate their tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance and the distance to that neighbor. If this tentative distance is less than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n5. If the destination room (Room 14) has been visited, stop. The shortest path is the sequence of visited rooms that led to the destination, in reverse order.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. Go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Room 16 to Room 14 is:\n\n16, 13, 14\n\nAnswer: 16, 13, 14"
