Create a table with all the rooms and their connections and assign a tentative distance to each room (infinity for all except Room 8, which is 0).\n2. Mark Room 8 as visited and update the tentative distances for all rooms connected to it (Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10).\n3. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance that is not visited (Room 5) and mark it as visited.\n4. Update the tentative distances for all rooms connected to Room 5 (Rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8).\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until Room 6 is marked as visited.\n6. Trace back the shortest path from Room 8 to Room 6 using the table of connections and tentative distances.\n\nThe shortest path from Room 8 to Room 6 is: 8, 6\n\nAnswer: 8, 6"
