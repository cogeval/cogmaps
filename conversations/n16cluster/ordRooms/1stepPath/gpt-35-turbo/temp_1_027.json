            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited rooms. Initially, all rooms except room 5 are unvisited.\n2. Assign a tentative distance value to each room. For room 5, the distance value is 0. For all other rooms, the distance value is infinity.\n3. Set the initial room as current. The initial room is room 5.\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring unvisited rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighboring room is the distance from the current room to the neighboring room plus the distance value of the current room. For example, if the current room is room 5 and a neighboring room is room 8, the tentative distance to room 8 would be the distance from room 5 to room 8 (which is 2) plus the distance value of room 5 (which is 0), for a total tentative distance of 2.\n5. Compare the tentative distance to each neighboring room with the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the tentative distance to room 8 is 2 and the current assigned value for room 8 is infinity, we would assign a distance value of 2 to room 8.\n6. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n7. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest assigned distance, and set it as the new current room. In the case of a tie, any room can be selected.\n8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 until all the rooms have been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine that the shortest path from room 5 to room 8 is:\n\n5, 8\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 5, 8"
