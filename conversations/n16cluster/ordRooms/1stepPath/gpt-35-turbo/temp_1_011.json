Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 8 and to infinity for all the other rooms. The list of visited rooms starts as empty.\n\n2. Set the current room as room 8 and the initial distance as zero.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room (room 8) to the neighbor through the current room.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited list.\n\n5. Among the unvisited neighboring rooms, select the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room for the next iteration.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 6) is visited.\n\n7. To reconstruct the shortest path, start from the destination room (room 6) and go back to the initial room (room 8), following the path with the lowest distances.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 8 to room 6: 8, 6. \n\nAnswer: 8, 6."
