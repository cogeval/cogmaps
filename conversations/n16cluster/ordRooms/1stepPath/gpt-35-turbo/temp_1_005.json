            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 3, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for the starting room and to infinity for all other rooms.\n\n2. Set the starting room as current.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge connecting it to the neighbor.\n\n4. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current distance assigned to the neighbor. If it's smaller, update the neighbor's distance.\n\n5. When we're done considering all the neighbors, mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n6. If the destination room has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific rooms) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial room and remaining unvisited rooms), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room.\n\n8. Go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 2 to room 3 is: 2, 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 3"
