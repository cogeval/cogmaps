Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 8 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 8.\n3. For each room adjacent to the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the tentative distance to the current room and the weight of the edge between the current room and the adjacent room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance to that room, update the tentative distance to the new distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Set the next current room to the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. If all remaining unvisited rooms have infinite tentative distances, stop, as there is no path to the destination.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 6) is visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is: 8, 5, 6\n\nAnswer: 8, 5, 6"
