Create a table to track the shortest distance from room 5 to all other rooms. Initially, set the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 5, which should be set to 0.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | inf      |\n| 10   | inf      |\n| 11   | inf      |\n| 12   | inf      |\n| 13   | inf      |\n| 14   | inf      |\n| 15   | inf      |\n| 16   | inf      |\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms, initially containing all rooms.\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}\n\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty, select the unvisited room with the shortest distance to room 5.\n\n4. For each neighboring room that is still unvisited, calculate the distance from the current room to that room. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance in the table, update the distance in the table.\n\n5. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get the following shortest distances:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 2        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 3        |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | 1        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 5        |\n| 14   | 4        |\n| 15   | 4        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 5 to room 3 is: 5, 6, 12, 9, 3\n\nAnswer: 5, 6, 12, 9, 3"
