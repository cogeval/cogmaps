Starting from room 8, we can calculate the shortest distance to each of the connected rooms and update the distances as we explore the graph. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 8 which has a distance of 0. We also create a set of unvisited rooms containing all rooms.\n\n2. Among the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest distance from room 8. In this case, it is room 5 with a distance of 1.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 5 (rooms 6, 7, and 8), calculate the distance from room 8 through room 5. If this distance is smaller than the current distance to that room, update the distance.\n\n4. Mark room 5 as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we visit room 6.\n\nThe shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is: 8, 5, 6\n\nAnswer: 8, 5, 6"
