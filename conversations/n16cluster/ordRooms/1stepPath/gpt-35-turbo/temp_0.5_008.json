            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 8 to room 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from room 8, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the previous room that leads to the shortest distance. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited rooms and initialize the distance to each room as infinity, except for room 8 which is 0. Also, initialize the previous room of each room as None.\n\n2. From room 8, calculate the distance to each of its connected rooms (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10). The distance to room 5 is 1, the distance to room 6 is 2, the distance to room 7 is 1, and the distance to room 10 is 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 5) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8). The distance to room 3 is 2, the distance to room 6 is still 2, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 8 is 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 7) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 1, 5, 6, and 8). The distance to room 1 is 2, the distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 2, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 8) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10). The distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 2, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 10 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 5) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8). The distance to room 3 is still 2, the distance to room 6 is now 3, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 7) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 1, 5, 6, and 8). The distance to room 1 is still 2, the distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 3, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n8. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 8) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10). The distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is now 4, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 10 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n9. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 7) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 1, 5, 6, and 8). The distance to room 1 is still 2, the distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 4, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 6) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12). The distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 7 is still 1, the distance to room 8 is still 1, and the distance to room 12 is 5. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n11. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 5) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8). The distance to room 3 is still 2, the distance to room 6 is still 1, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n12. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 7) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 1, 5, 6, and 8). The distance to room 1 is still 2, the distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 1, and the distance to room 8 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n13. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 8) and repeat step 2 for its connected rooms (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10). The distance to room 5 is still 1, the distance to room 6 is still 1, the distance to room 7 is still 1, and the distance to room 10 is still 1. Update the distance and previous room of each of these rooms accordingly.\n\n14. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 6). We have found the shortest path from room 8 to room 6, which is 8-7-6. The distance is 2.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 8 to room 6 is: Answer: 8, 7, 6."
