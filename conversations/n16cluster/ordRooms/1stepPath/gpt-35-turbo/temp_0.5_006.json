Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 2 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room then go back to step 3.\n\n6. Continue this process until the destination room (room 4) has been visited. \n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 4 is: 2, 4\n\nAnswer: 2, 4"
