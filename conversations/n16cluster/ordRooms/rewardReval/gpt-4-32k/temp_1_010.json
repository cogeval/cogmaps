Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

We can continue from room 2 to room 3, then 4.\n- From room 3, we can reach room 4, then room 2.\n- From room 4, we can reach room 14.\n- From room 7, we can reach room 8.\n\nStep 3: Examine the paths leading to room 10.\n- Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 14 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 (Reward: 10)\n- Path 2: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 (Reward: 10)\n\nStep 4: Choose the path with the most reward without penalties.\n- Path 1 has no penalties, so the reward remains 10.\n- Path 2 also has no penalties, so the reward remains 10.\n\nBoth paths provide the same reward without penalties. However, Path 2 is shorter.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
