Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

Create a table with the reward or penalty for each room:\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: -15\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: 0\nRoom 9: 0\nRoom 10: 10\nRoom 11: 0\nRoom 12: 0\nRoom 13: 0\nRoom 14: 0\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: 0\n\n2. Create a dictionary of connections between rooms:\n{\n1: [2, 3, 4, 7],\n2: [1, 3, 4, 16],\n3: [1, 2, 4, 5],\n4: [1, 2, 3, 14],\n5: [6, 7, 8, 3],\n6: [5, 7, 8, 12],\n7: [1, 8, 6, 5],\n8: [5, 6, 7, 10],\n9: [10, 11, 12, 15],\n10: [9, 11, 8, 12],\n11: [13, 9, 12, 10],\n12: [9, 10, 11, 6],\n13: [14, 15, 16, 11],\n14: [4, 13, 15, 16],\n15: [13, 14, 16, 9],\n16: [13, 14, 15, 2]\n}\n\n3. Initialize the distance and visited dictionaries:\ndistance = {1: 0}\nvisited = {}\n\n4. While there are unvisited nodes:\n- Select the node with the smallest distance and mark it as visited\n- For each neighbor of the current node:\n  - If the new distance to the neighbor is better than the old distance, update the distance\n- Repeat until all nodes are visited\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following table of distances:\n{\n1: 0,\n2: 0,\n3: 0,\n4: 0,\n5: -15,\n6: -15,\n7: 0,\n8: -15,\n9: -5,\n10: 10,\n11: 5,\n12: -5,\n13: 10,\n14: -5,\n15: 0,\n16: 0\n}\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 10, 13, 16. \n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 13, 16"
