Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we need to find the shortest paths to room 10 and room 15, and then compare the rewards for these paths. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distances of all rooms to infinity, except for room 1 which is 0.\n2. Set the priority queue to contain only room 1 with a distance of 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   1. Pop the room with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   2. For each adjacent room, calculate the distance from the current room to that room as the sum of the current distance and the distance between the rooms.\n   3. If the calculated distance is smaller than the recorded distance for that room, update the distance and the previous room in the path.\n   4. If the adjacent room has not been visited yet, add it to the priority queue.\n4. After the algorithm is complete, backtrack from room 10 and room 15 to room 1 to find the paths and rewards.\n5. Compare the rewards for the paths to room 10 and room 15, and output the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following paths and rewards:\n\nPath to room 10: 1, 7, 8, 10\nReward: 50\n\nPath to room 15: 1, 3, 5, 15\nReward: 10\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is the path to room 10: 1, 7, 8, 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
