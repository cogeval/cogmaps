Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Including any paths the use the same tile the entire run like (9-16),  (10.-Room reward 1:3 (you start in room and ends room),(3->, (Room number from past (8)) and  the number is not change. Also, room selection after obtain items do change the tile to which room is attached or connected at run.)'\nNo limitation\nThis will also require backtracked search since I already give number path which is limited search that covers only a certain way to get chest in question with reward before going backwards but back tracking search to solve these type with shortest step path given any situation is possible if certain requirement follow. We called branch and bound backtrack search cause for path generation in some time back it use up huge GB data set for testing such this method or heuristic. I give 1 to indicate what you can assume like from Room, and yes limited space storage of your side not enough RAM available as test  data of several millions are keep run so this is only way to test  with some limitation we are talking order of  few dozense such a world size in bitmask size. And here is path which will end in Room after visit one after the obtained reward of rooms and such shortesdt is my goal in given constraints please achieve'', then  the path. "
