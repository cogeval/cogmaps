Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for room 4 which has a distance of 0.\n2. Set the initial room as room 4.\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the distance from the initial room to that room. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance, update the distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room with the shortest distance from the initial room as the next current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 7) is reached.\n\nThe shortest path from room 4 to room 7 is: 4, 1, 7.\n\nAnswer: 4, 1, 7"
