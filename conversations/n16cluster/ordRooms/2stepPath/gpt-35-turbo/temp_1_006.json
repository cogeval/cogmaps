Set the distance of room 2 to 0 and all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Set room 2 as the current room and mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighboring room that has not been visited, calculate its tentative distance as the distance from room 2 to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighboring room. If this tentative distance is less than the previous tentative distance for the neighboring room, update its tentative distance.\n4. Set the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the new current room and mark it as visited. If the destination room (room 5) has been visited, stop.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all unvisited neighboring rooms of the current room.\n6. The shortest path to room 5 is the sequence of visited rooms with the lowest sum of tentative distances.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 2 to room 5 is: \n\n2, 1, 3, 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 2, 1, 3, 5"
