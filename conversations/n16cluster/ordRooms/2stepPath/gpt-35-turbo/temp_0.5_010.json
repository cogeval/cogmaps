From room 13, we can reach room 11 and 14. From room 15, we can reach room 9, 13, and 16. From room 16, we can reach room 2, 13, 14, and 15. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can calculate the shortest distance from room 14 to each of the other rooms: \n\n- Room 13: distance 1 (via room 14)\n- Room 15: distance 2 (via room 14 and 13)\n- Room 16: distance 2 (via room 14 and 13)\n- Room 11: distance 3 (via room 14, 13, and 11)\n- Room 9: distance 3 (via room 14, 13, and 15)\n- Room 2: distance 3 (via room 14, 16, and 2)\n- Room 4: distance 4 (via room 14, 13, 11, and 4)\n- Room 10: distance 4 (via room 14, 13, 11, and 10)\n- Room 12: distance 4 (via room 14, 13, 11, and 12)\n- Room 5: distance 5 (via room 14, 13, 11, 12, and 5)\n- Room 6: distance 6 (via room 14, 13, 11, 12, 6)\n- Room 7: distance 6 (via room 14, 13, 11, 12, 6, and 7)\n- Room 3: distance 7 (via room 14, 13, 11, 12, 6, 5, and 3)\n- Room 8: distance 7 (via room 14, 13, 11, 12, 6, 5, and 8)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is: 14, 13, 15, 9\n\nAnswer: 14, 13, 15, 9"
