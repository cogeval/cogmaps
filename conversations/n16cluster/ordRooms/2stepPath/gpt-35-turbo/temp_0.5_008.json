Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 2: rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16.\n3. Calculate the distance from room 2 to each of these rooms: room 1 is 1 unit away, room 3 is 1 unit away, room 4 is 1 unit away, and room 16 is 1 unit away.\n4. Mark room 2 as visited.\n5. Move to the room that is closest to room 2: in this case, it's a tie between rooms 1, 3, and 4. Let's choose room 1.\n6. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 1, except for room 2 (since we've already visited it): rooms 3, 4, and 7.\n7. Calculate the distance from room 2 to each of these rooms, going through room 1: room 3 is 2 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, and 1 unit from 1 to 3), room 4 is 2 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, and 1 unit from 1 to 4), and room 7 is 2 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, and 1 unit from 1 to 7).\n8. Mark room 1 as visited.\n9. Move to the room that is closest to room 2, going through room 1: in this case, it's a tie between rooms 3, 4, and 7. Let's choose room 3.\n10. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 3, except for rooms 1 and 2 (since we've already visited them): rooms 4, 5, and 1.\n11. Calculate the distance from room 2 to each of these rooms, going through rooms 1 and 3: room 4 is 3 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 3, and 1 unit from 3 to 4), room 5 is 3 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 3, and 1 unit from 3 to 5), and room 1 is 2 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, and 1 unit from 1 to 3).\n12. Mark room 3 as visited.\n13. Move to the room that is closest to room 2, going through rooms 1 and 3: in this case, it's room 1.\n14. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 1, except for rooms 2 and 3 (since we've already visited them): rooms 4 and 7.\n15. Calculate the distance from room 2 to each of these rooms, going through rooms 1 and 3: room 4 is 3 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 3, and 1 unit from 3 to 4), and room 7 is 3 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 3, and 1 unit from 3 to 7).\n16. Mark room 1 as visited.\n17. Move to the room that is closest to room 2, going through rooms 1 and 3: in this case, it's room 4.\n18. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 4, except for rooms 1, 2, and 3 (since we've already visited them): rooms 13, 14, and 15.\n19.

Mark room 4 as visited.\n21. Move to the room that is closest to room 2, going through rooms 1, 3, and 4: in this case, it's room 14.\n22. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to room 14, except for rooms 4 (since we've already visited it): rooms 13, 15, and 16.\n23. Calculate the distance from room 2 to each of these rooms, going through rooms 1, 3, and 4: room 13 is 7 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 4, 3 units from 4 to 14, and 2 units from 14 to 13), room 15 is 6 units away (1 unit from 2 to 1, 1 unit from 1 to 4, 3 units from 4 to 14, and 1 unit from 14 to 15), and room 16 is 6 units away (1 unit from 2 to 16, 3 units from 16 to 14, and 2 units from 14 to 13).\n24.

Mark room 15 as visited.\n29. Move to the room that is closest to room 2, going through rooms 1, 3, and 4: in this case, it's room 13.\n30. We have reached room 13, so the shortest path from room 2 to room 13 is: 2, 1, 4, 14, 15, 13.\n\nAnswer: 2, 1, 4, 14, 15, 13."
