Then, we can visit the next closest room and repeat the process until we reach room 5. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Set the distance of room 1 as 0 and all other rooms as infinity.\n2. Set the unvisited set as all rooms.\n3. For the current room (room 1), visit its adjacent rooms (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7) and update their distances as follows:\n   - Room 2: distance = 1 (via room 1)\n   - Room 3: distance = 1 (via room 1)\n   - Room 4: distance = 1 (via room 1)\n   - Room 7: distance = 1 (via room 1)\n4. Mark room 1 as visited and set it as the current room.\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for the current room (room 2):\n   - Room 3: distance = 2 (via room 2)\n   - Room 4: distance = 2 (via room 2)\n   - Room 16: distance = 2 (via room 2)\n6. Mark room 2 as visited and set room 3 as the current room.\n7. Repeat step 3 and 4 for the current room (room 3):\n   - Room 5: distance = 3 (via room 3)\n8. Mark room 3 as visited and set room 5 as the current room.\n9. The shortest path from room 1 to room 5 is: 1, 3, 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 3, 5."
