Set the distance to 0 for room 14 and infinity for all other rooms.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   |  \u221e       |\n|  2   |  \u221e       |\n|  3   |  \u221e       |\n|  4   |  0       |\n|  5   |  \u221e       |\n|  6   |  \u221e       |\n|  7   |  \u221e       |\n|  8   |  \u221e       |\n|  9   |  \u221e       |\n|  10  |  \u221e       |\n|  11  |  \u221e       |\n|  12  |  \u221e       |\n|  13  |  \u221e       |\n|  14  |  0       |\n|  15  |  \u221e       |\n|  16  |  \u221e       |\n```\n\n2. Mark room 14 as visited and set its distance to 0.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   |  \u221e       |\n|  2   |  \u221e       |\n|  3   |  \u221e       |\n|  4   |  0       |\n|  5   |  \u221e       |\n|  6   |  \u221e       |\n|  7   |  \u221e       |\n|  8   |  \u221e       |\n|  9   |  \u221e       |\n|  10  |  \u221e       |\n|  11  |  \u221e       |\n|  12  |  \u221e       |\n|  13  |  \u221e       |\n|  14  |  0       |\n|  15  |  \u221e       |\n|  16  |  \u221e       |\n```\n\n3.

Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 2.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   |  1       |\n|  2   |  1       |\n|  3   |  1       |\n|  4   |  0       |\n|  5   |  2       |\n|  6   |  \u221e       |\n|  7   |  1       |\n|  8   |  2       |\n|  9   |  \u221e       |\n|  10  |  \u221e       |\n|  11  |  \u221e       |\n|  12  |  \u221e       |\n|  13  |  2       |\n|  14  |  0       |\n|  15  |  2       |\n|  16  |  1       |\n```\n\n7. Continue this process until room 9 is visited. The final table will look like this:\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   |  1       |\n|  2   |  1       |\n|  3   |  1       |\n|  4   |  0       |\n|  5   |  2       |\n|  6   |  3       |\n|  7   |  1       |\n|  8   |  2       |\n|  9   |  3       |\n|  10  |  2       |\n|  11  |  3       |\n|  12  |  3       |\n|  13  |  2       |\n|  14  |  0       |\n|  15  |  2       |\n|  16  |  1       |\n```\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is: 14, 4, 7, 1, 3, 9. \n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 7, 1, 3, 9."
