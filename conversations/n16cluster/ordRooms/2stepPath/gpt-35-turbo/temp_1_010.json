            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 9, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\n1. First, we create a table to keep track of the shortest known distance to each room. We start with the distance to room 14 as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  14  |    0     |\n|  1   |  infinity|\n|  2   |  infinity|\n|  3   |  infinity|\n|  4   |  infinity|\n|  5   |  infinity|\n|  6   |  infinity|\n|  7   |  infinity|\n|  8   |  infinity|\n|  9   |  infinity|\n|  10  |  infinity|\n|  11  |  infinity|\n|  12  |  infinity|\n|  13  |  infinity|\n|  15  |  infinity|\n|  16  |  infinity|\n\n2. We start at room 14 and explore its neighbors: rooms 4, 13, 15, and 16. We update the distances to these rooms as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  14  |    0     |\n|  4   |    1     |\n|  13  |    1     |\n|  15  |    1     |\n|  16  |    1     |\n|  1   |  infinity|\n|  2   |  infinity|\n|  3   |  infinity|\n|  5   |  infinity|\n|  6   |  infinity|\n|  7   |  infinity|\n|  8   |  infinity|\n|  9   |  infinity|\n|  10  |  infinity|\n|  11  |  infinity|\n|  12  |  infinity|\n\n\n3. Next, we move to the neighbor with the shortest distance, which is room 4. We explore its neighbors (rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14) and update their distances as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  14  |    0     |\n|  4   |    1     |\n|  13  |    1     |\n|  15  |    1     |\n|  16  |    1     |\n|  1   |    2     |\n|  2   |    2     |\n|  3   |    2     |\n|  5   |  infinity|\n|  6   |  infinity|\n|  7   |  infinity|\n|  8   |  infinity|\n|  9   |  infinity|\n|  10  |  infinity|\n|  11  |  infinity|\n|  12  |  infinity|\n\n4. We continue to the neighbor with the shortest distance, which is room 13. We explore its neighbors (rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11) and update their distances as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  14  |    0     |\n|  4   |    1     |\n|  13  |    1     |\n|  15  |    1     |\n|  16  |    1     |\n|  1   |    2     |\n|  2   |    2     |\n|  3   |    2     |\n|  5   |    2     |\n|  6   |  infinity|\n|  7   |  infinity|\n|  8   |  infinity|\n|  9   |    2     |\n|  10  |  infinity|\n|  11  |    2     |\n|  12  |  infinity|\n\n\n5. We continue to the neighbor with the shortest distance, which is room 15. We explore its neighbors (rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9) and update their distances as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  14  |    0     |\n|  4   |    1     |\n|  13  |    1     |\n|  15  |    1     |\n|  16  |    1     |\n|  1   |    2     |\n|  2   |    2     |\n|  3   |    2     |\n|  5   |    2     |\n|  6   |    3     |\n|  7   |  infinity|\n|  8   |    2     |\n|  9   |    2     |\n|  10  |  infinity|\n|  11  |    2     |\n|  12  |  infinity|\n\n\n6. We continue to the neighbor with the shortest distance, which is room 9. Since this is our destination, we stop and backtrack to find the shortest path. The shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is:\n\n14 -> 13 -> 15 -> 9\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 14,13,15,9"
