Assign a tentative distance of 0 to the starting vertex (room 3), and infinity to all other vertices.\n2. Mark all vertices unvisited. Set the starting vertex as the current vertex (room 3).\n3. For the current vertex, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the current vertex's distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current vertex to the neighbor.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current vertex, mark the current vertex as visited.\n5. Among the unvisited vertices, select the one with the smallest tentative distance and make it the current vertex.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination vertex (room 7) has been visited or there are no more unvisited vertices.\n\nUsing the above algorithm, the shortest path from room 3 to room 7 is:\n3 -> 1 -> 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 3,1,7"
