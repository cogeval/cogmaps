            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 2 and to infinity for all the other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current: room 2.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the current room's distance and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room. For example, if the current room is room 2 and its neighbor is room 4, then the tentative distance to room 4 is 1 (the distance from room 2 to room 4).\n4. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the tentative distance to room 4 is 1 and its current assigned value is infinity, then we assign 1 to room 4.\n5. When we are done considering all of the neighboring rooms, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new current room. If there is no such room, then stop.\n7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the destination room (room 7) has been visited. The shortest path to room 7 will be the sequence of rooms that were visited, in reverse order.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 2 to room 7 as: 2, 1, 7.\n\nAnswer: 2, 1, 7."
