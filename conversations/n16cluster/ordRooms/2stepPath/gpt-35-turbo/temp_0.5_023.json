Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 14 and infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as room 14 and mark it as visited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance to the neighbor room. If this tentative distance is less than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. Among the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the next current room. Repeat step 3 until you reach room 9.\n5. Once you have reached room 9, backtrack from it to room 14, following the path with the lowest distance.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is:\n\n14, 13, 9\n\nAnswer: 14, 13, 9"
