            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 14, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 3. For the rooms that are directly connected to room 3, we set their distance to 1, and for the others, we set their distance to infinity.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |   inf    |\n|   2  |   inf    |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  |   inf    |\n|   7  |    1     |\n|   8  |    2     |\n|   9  |   inf    |\n|  10  |   inf    |\n|  11  |   inf    |\n|  12  |   inf    |\n|  13  |   inf    |\n|  14  |   inf    |\n|  15  |   inf    |\n|  16  |   inf    |\n```\n2. Mark room 3 as visited and set its distance as final.\n3. For each room directly connected to room 3, update its distance to 1 and set its previous room as room 3.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  |   inf    |\n|   7  |    1     |\n|   8  |    2     |\n|   9  |   inf    |\n|  10  |   inf    |\n|  11  |   inf    |\n|  12  |   inf    |\n|  13  |   inf    |\n|  14  |   inf    |\n|  15  |   inf    |\n|  16  |   inf    |\n```\n4. Select the unvisited room with the shortest distance, which is room 1.\n5. For each room directly connected to room 1, check if going through room 1 is a shorter path than its current distance. If so, update its distance and set its previous room as room 1.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    0     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  |    2     |\n|   7  |    1     |\n|   8  |    2     |\n|   9  |   inf    |\n|  10  |   inf    |\n|  11  |   inf    |\n|  12  |   inf    |\n|  13  |   inf    |\n|  14  |    2     |\n|  15  |   inf    |\n|  16  |    2     |\n```\n6. Mark room 1 as visited and set its distance as final.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until we visit room 14. The shortest path from room 3 to room 14 is:\n```\n3, 1, 4, 13, 14\n```\nAnswer: 3, 1, 4, 13, 14"
