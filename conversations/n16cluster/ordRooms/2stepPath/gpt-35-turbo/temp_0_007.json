Set the distance of room 2 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   0\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n3. Set the current room to room 2.\n\n4. For the current room, consider all its neighbors that have not been visited. Calculate their tentative distances from room 2 by adding the distance from the current room to the neighbor's distance. If this tentative distance is less than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance in the table.\n\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   1\n  2  |   0\n  3  |   1\n  4  |   1\n  5  |   2\n  6  |   3\n  7  |   1\n  8  |   2\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   2\n 11  |   3\n 12  |   3\n 13  |   4\n 14  |   2\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   1\n```\n\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n6. If the destination room (room 14) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest distance and set it as the current room. Go back to step 4.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 14 is: 2, 4, 14\n\nAnswer: 2, 4, 14"
