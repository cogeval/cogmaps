Initialize the distance from room 4 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 4 which is 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms that includes all rooms.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 4.\n   b. For each neighbor of this room that is still in the set of unvisited rooms:\n      i. Calculate the distance to the neighbor through the current room.\n      ii. If this distance is less than the current distance of the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance.\n   c. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n4. Once we have visited room 13, we can backtrack to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 4 to room 13 is: \n\nAnswer: 4, 1, 7, 5, 3, 15, 13"
