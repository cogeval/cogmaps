            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 9, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a list of unvisited rooms and mark the distance to each room as infinity, except for room 14 which will have a distance of 0.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 14 and create an empty list to store the visited rooms.\n\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance from room 14 to that neighbor (which is the distance to the current room plus the weight of the edge connecting the two rooms). If this distance is less than the current recorded distance to that neighbor, update the recorded distance.\n\n4. Once all neighbors have been processed, mark the current room as visited and remove it from the list of unvisited rooms.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest recorded distance as the next current room and repeat steps 3-4 until the destination room (room 9) has been visited.\n\n6. To reconstruct the shortest path from room 14 to room 9, we can start at room 9 and follow the recorded parent of each room until we reach room 14.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is: 14, 4, 1, 3, 5, 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 14, 4, 1, 3, 5, 9."
