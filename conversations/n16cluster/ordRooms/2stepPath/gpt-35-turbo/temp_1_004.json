Starting from room 14, we can calculate the shortest distance to each connected room, and then continue the process until we reach room 9.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from room 14 with a distance of 0.\n2. Calculate the distances to all connected rooms: room 4 (distance 1), room 13 (distance 1), room 15 (distance 1), and room 16 (distance 1).\n3. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 4 (distance 1).\n4. Calculate the distances to all connected rooms of room 4, excluding room 14: room 1 (distance 2), room 13 (distance 2), room 15 (distance 2), and room 16 (distance 2).\n5. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 13 (distance 2).\n6. Calculate the distances to all connected rooms of room 13, excluding room 14 and room 4: room 11 (distance 3), room 15 (distance 3), room 16 (distance 3), and room 9 (distance 4).\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 15 (distance 3).\n8. Calculate the distances to all connected rooms of room 15, excluding room 14, room 4, and room 13: room 13 (distance 4), room 14 (distance 4), room 16 (distance 4), and room 9 (distance 4).\n9. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 9 (distance 4).\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is 14 -> 4 -> 13 -> 15 -> 9.\n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 13, 15, 9"
