The distance to room 4 is 0, and the distance to all other rooms is infinity. We also mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 2    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 3    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 4    | 0        | false   |\n| 5    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 6    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 7    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 15   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 16   | \u221e        | false   |\n\n2. Set the current room to room 4.\n\n3. For each room connected to the current room, calculate the distance from the current room to that room. If the calculated distance is less than the distance currently in the table for that room, update the table with the new distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 1        | false   |\n| 2    | 1        | false   |\n| 3    | 1        | false   |\n| 4    | 0        | true    |\n| 5    | 2        | false   |\n| 6    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 7    | 1        | false   |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 15   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 16   | \u221e        | false   |\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 1        | false   |\n| 2    | 1        | false   |\n| 3    | 1        | false   |\n| 4    | 0        | true    |\n| 5    | 2        | false   |\n| 6    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 7    | 1        | true    |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 15   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 16   | \u221e        | false   |\n\n5. Set the current room to the unvisited room with the smallest distance. In this case, it is room 1.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the current room is room 5.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 1        | true    |\n| 2    | 1        | true    |\n| 3    | 1        | true    |\n| 4    | 0        | true    |\n| 5    | 2        | true    |\n| 6    | 3        | true    |\n| 7    | 1        | true    |\n| 8    | 3        | true    |\n| 9    | 4        | true    |\n| 10   | 2        | true    |\n| 11   | 4        | true    |\n| 12   | 3        | true    |\n| 13   | 3        | true    |\n| 14   | 1        | true    |\n| 15   | 2        | true    |\n| 16   | 2        | true    |\n\nThe shortest path from room 4 to room 5 is 4, 1, 3, 5.\n\nAnswer: 4, 1, 3, 5."
