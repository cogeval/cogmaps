We start at room 14, so the initial distance to this room is 0 and the distances to all other rooms are infinity.\n2. We consider the neighbors of room 14: rooms 4, 13, 15, and 16. We update their distances to be the distance from room 14 plus the distance to each neighbor. So, the distances to rooms 4, 13, and 15 are now 1 (since they are directly connected to room 14), and the distance to room 16 is 2. The distance to all other rooms remains infinity.\n3. We select the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet, which is room 4 with a distance of 1. We update the distances to its neighbors (rooms 1, 13, and 15) to be the distance from room 4 plus the distance to each neighbor. The distance to room 1 is now 2, the distance to room 13 is still 1, and the distance to room 15 is now 2. The distance to all other rooms remains infinity.\n4. We repeat step 3 with the smallest unvisited room until we reach room 9. \n\nThe shortest path from room 14 to room 9 is: 14, 13, 9.\n\nAnswer: 14, 13, 9."
