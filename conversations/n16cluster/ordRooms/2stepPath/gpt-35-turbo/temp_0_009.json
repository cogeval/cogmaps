Set the distance of room 2 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 2 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 2, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 3 is connected to room 2 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance in the table to 1.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 3.\n\n5. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n6. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is connected to room 3 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance in the table to 2 (1 + 1).\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 4.\n\n8. Mark room 4 as visited.\n\n9. For each room connected to room 4, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 14 is connected to room 4 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance in the table to 3 (2 + 1).\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n10. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 5.\n\n11. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n12. For each room connected to room 5, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 15 is connected to room 5 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance in the table to 3 (2 + 1).\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 0        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 3        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n13. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 15.\n\n14. Mark room 15 as visited.\n\n15. We have reached our destination.
