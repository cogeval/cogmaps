Start at room 3 and initialize the distance to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 3 which has distance 0.\n2. Among the rooms adjacent to room 3 (rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5), update their distances to be the distance from room 3 to that room.\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 5 (with distance 1).\n4. Among the rooms adjacent to room 5 (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8), update their distances to be the minimum of their current distance and the distance from room 5 to that room plus the distance from room 3 to room 5 (which is 1).\n5. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 8 (with distance 2).\n6. We have found the shortest path from room 3 to room 8. The path is: 3, 5, 8.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8"
