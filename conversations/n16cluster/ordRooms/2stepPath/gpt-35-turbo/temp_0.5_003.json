Set the distance of Room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited and create a set of all unvisited rooms.\n3. For the current room (which is initially Room 1), calculate the tentative distances to all neighboring rooms. The tentative distance to a neighboring room is the distance to the current room plus the distance between the current room and the neighboring room (which is 1 for all adjacent rooms).\n4. Update the tentative distances of the neighboring rooms if they are smaller than their current tentative distances.\n5. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n6. If the set of unvisited rooms is empty or if the destination room (which is Room 6) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and repeat from step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from Room 1 to Room 6: 1, 7, 6.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 6."
