            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 16, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 3 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the tentative distance from the initial room. The tentative distance is the sum of the distance from the current room to the neighbor and the distance from the initial room to the current room.\n4. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance to the tentative distance.\n5. When we are done considering all the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room then go back to step 3.\n7. If the destination room (room 16) has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific rooms) or if the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial room and remaining unvisited rooms), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 3 to room 16 is:\n\n3, 1, 2, 16\n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 2, 16"
