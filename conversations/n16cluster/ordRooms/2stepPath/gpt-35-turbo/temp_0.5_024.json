Set the distance of room 7 to 0 and all other distances to infinity. Also, create a set of unvisited rooms, initially containing all the rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance from 7 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | infinity        |\n| 2    | infinity        |\n| 3    | infinity        |\n| 4    | infinity        |\n| 5    | infinity        |\n| 6    | infinity        |\n| 7    | 0               |\n| 8    | infinity        |\n| 9    | infinity        |\n| 10   | infinity        |\n| 11   | infinity        |\n| 12   | infinity        |\n| 13   | infinity        |\n| 14   | infinity        |\n| 15   | infinity        |\n| 16   | infinity        |\n\n2. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 7, which is room 8 (distance = 1). Visit room 8 and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10) if they can be reached with a shorter distance through room 8.\n\n| Room | Distance from 7 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | infinity        |\n| 2    | infinity        |\n| 3    | infinity        |\n| 4    | infinity        |\n| 5    | 2               |\n| 6    | 2               |\n| 7    | 1               |\n| 8    | 0               |\n| 9    | infinity        |\n| 10   | 2               |\n| 11   | infinity        |\n| 12   | infinity        |\n| 13   | infinity        |\n| 14   | infinity        |\n| 15   | infinity        |\n| 16   | infinity        |\n\n3.

Visit room 6 and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12) if they can be reached with a shorter distance through room 6.\n\n| Room | Distance from 7 |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1    | infinity        |\n| 2    | infinity        |\n| 3    | 3               |\n| 4    | infinity        |\n| 5    | 2               |\n| 6    | 2               |\n| 7    | 1               |\n| 8    | 2               |\n| 9    | infinity        |\n| 10   | 2               |\n| 11   | infinity        |\n| 12   | 3               |\n| 13   | infinity        |\n| 14   | infinity        |\n| 15   | infinity        |\n| 16   | infinity        |\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from room 7, which is room 10 (distance = 2). Since room 10 is the destination, we can stop here and trace back the shortest path from room 10 to room 7 using the table. The shortest path from room 7 to room 10 is:\n\n7, 8, 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 7, 8, 10"
