It is not, so proceed to step 4.\nStep 4: Determine the shortest path from each of the connected rooms (1, 2, 3, and 14) to room 16.\nStep 4a: From room 1, room 16 is not directly connected. Rooms connected to room 1 are 2, 3, 4, and 7.\nStep 4b: From room 2, room 16 is directly connected. So, the path from room 4 to room 16 via room 2 is 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 16. Remember this path.\nStep 4c: From room 3, room 16 is not directly connected. Rooms connected to room 3 are 1, 2, 4, and 5.\nStep 4d: From room 14, room 16 is directly connected. So, the path from room 4 to room 16 via room 14 is 4 \u2192 14 \u2192 16. Remember this path.\nStep 5: Compare the paths to find the shortest one. The paths are 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 16 and 4 \u2192 14 \u2192 16, both with a length of 3. Either path is the shortest.\n\nAnswer: 4, 2, 16"
