Room 12 is connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. So the path would be 5-6-12-11.\n\nFor room 7:\n- Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5, none of which are room 11.\n\nFor room 8:\n- Room 8 is connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. So the path would be 5-8-10-11.\n\nStep 4: Compare the paths and choose the shortest one. Both paths 5-6-12-11 and 5-8-10-11 are of the same length (4 rooms), so we can choose either one as the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: 5,6,12,11"
