Room 15\n\nI found this path by using a graph algorithm called **Dijkstra's algorithm**. This algorithm works by starting at a single node and exploring all of its neighbors. The node with the shortest distance to the starting node is added to the shortest path first. This process continues until the destination node is reached.\n\nIn this case, Dijkstra's algorithm found that the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is 3 rooms long. The path is:\n\n1. Room 3\n2.
