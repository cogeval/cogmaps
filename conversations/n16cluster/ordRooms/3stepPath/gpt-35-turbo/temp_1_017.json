            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with each room and their distances from room 3, initially set to infinity except for room 3 itself, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Mark room 3 as visited and consider all its adjacent rooms: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. Update their distances to the sum of the distance to room 3 and the distance between room 3 and each adjacent room. For example, room 1 has a distance of 1 from room 3 (since they're adjacent) plus a distance of 1 from room 5 (which is the shortest path from room 5 to room 1), for a total distance of 2. Keep track of the previous room that led to each adjacent room, which in this case is room 3 for all of them.\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from the table. In this case, it's room 5 with a distance of 2.\n4. Mark room 5 as visited and update the distances and previous rooms of its adjacent unvisited rooms: rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3 (which is already visited). For example, room 7 has a distance of 1 (from room 5) plus a distance of 1 (from room 1), for a total distance of 2. Its previous room is room 5.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until room 15 is visited. In this case, the next unvisited room with the smallest distance is room 7 with a distance of 2 (from room 5) plus a distance of 3 (from room 1 and room 8), for a total distance of 5. Its previous room is room 5. The next unvisited room is room 8 with a distance of 2 (from room 5) plus a distance of 1 (from room 7), for a total distance of 3. Its previous room is room 7. The next unvisited room is room 10 with a distance of 3 (from room 8) plus a distance of 1 (from room 11), for a total distance of 4. Its previous room is room 8. Finally, room 15 is reached with a distance of 4 (from room 10) plus a distance of 1 (from room 9), for a total distance of 5. Its previous room is room 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 1, 7, 8, 10, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 7, 8, 10, 15."
