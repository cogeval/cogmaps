Assign to every room a tentative distance value: set it to zero for room 3 and to infinity for all other rooms. Set the initial visited nodes as empty.\n2. Set the current node to room 3 and the initial distance to 0.\n3. For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the current node's distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current node to that neighbor. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, for room 3, the tentative distances for its neighbors are: room 1 (1), room 2 (2), room 4 (1), and room 5 (1).\n4. When we are done considering all neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current node then go back to step 3.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is:\n\n3, 1, 7, 5, 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 3, 1, 7, 5, 15."
