Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for the starting room and to infinity for all other rooms.\n   - Room 3 has a tentative distance of 0, and all other rooms have a tentative distance of infinity.\n2. Set the starting room as the current room.\n   - Current room is 3.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the starting room to the current room, plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor.\n   - Room 5: tentative distance = 1 (3 -> 5)\n   - Room 4: tentative distance = 1 (3 -> 4)\n   - Room 1: tentative distance = 1 (3 -> 1)\n4. When we have finished considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n   - Room 3 is marked as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room.\n   - Room 5 is the closest unvisited room, so it becomes the new current room.\n6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the destination room has been visited. When it has, the shortest path has been found.\n   - Room 8: tentative distance = 2 (3 -> 5 -> 8)\n   - Room 9: tentative distance = 3 (3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9)\n   - Room 15: tentative distance = 4 (3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9 -> 15)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 5, 8, 9, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8, 9, 15"
