Assign a tentative distance value of zero to room 7 and infinity to all other rooms. Set room 7 as the current room.\n2. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 7 to that room. If it's less than the current distance value, update the distance value.\n3. Mark the current room as visited.\n4. If the destination room (room 16) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 7 to room 16 as:\n\nAnswer: 7, 1, 2, 16"
