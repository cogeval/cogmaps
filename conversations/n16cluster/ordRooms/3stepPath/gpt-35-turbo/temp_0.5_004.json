Initialize the distance to room 2 as 0 and all other distances as infinity. Set all rooms as unvisited.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 3    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 4    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 7    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 16   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 5    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 15   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 6    | \u221e        | false   |\n\n2. Set the current room as room 2.\n\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance from room 2 to that neighbor through the current room. If this distance is shorter than the current distance recorded in the table, update the table with the new shorter distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 2        | false   |\n| 3    | 1        | false   |\n| 4    | 2        | false   |\n| 7    | 3        | false   |\n| 16   | 5        | false   |\n| 5    | 2        | false   |\n| 8    | 3        | false   |\n| 10   | 4        | false   |\n| 11   | 5        | false   |\n| 12   | 5        | false   |\n| 13   | 6        | false   |\n| 14   | 3        | false   |\n| 15   | 7        | false   |\n| 6    | 3        | false   |\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance from the table. Set this room as the new current room.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 6) is reached.\n\nAnswer: 2, 3, 5, 6"
