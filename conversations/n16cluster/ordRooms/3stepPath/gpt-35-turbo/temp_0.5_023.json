            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 16 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 16 to each room. Initialize the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 16, which has a distance of 0. Also create a set of unvisited rooms containing all rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |         |\n| 2    | \u221e        |         |\n| 3    | \u221e        |         |\n| 4    | \u221e        |         |\n| 5    | \u221e        |         |\n| 6    | \u221e        |         |\n| 7    | \u221e        |         |\n| 8    | \u221e        |         |\n| 9    | \u221e        |         |\n| 10   | \u221e        |         |\n| 11   | \u221e        |         |\n| 12   | \u221e        |         |\n| 13   | \u221e        |         |\n| 14   | \u221e        |         |\n| 15   | \u221e        |         |\n| 16   | 0        |         |\n\n2. While there are unvisited rooms, select the room with the smallest distance and mark it as visited. For each of its unvisited neighbors, calculate the distance from room 16 to that neighbor through the current room. If this distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance, update the table.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 4        | visited |\n| 2    | 1        | visited |\n| 3    | 3        | visited |\n| 4    | 5        | visited |\n| 5    | 6        | visited |\n| 6    | 5        | visited |\n| 7    | 4        | visited |\n| 8    | 3        | visited |\n| 9    | 7        | visited |\n| 10   | 4        | visited |\n| 11   | 5        | visited |\n| 12   | 6        |         |\n| 13   | 4        | visited |\n| 14   | 5        | visited |\n| 15   | 5        | visited |\n| 16   | 0        | visited |\n\n3. Once room 12 has been visited, we can trace back the shortest path from room 16 to room 12 using the table. Starting from room 12, we look for its neighbor with the smallest distance, which is room 10. Then we look for the neighbor of room 10 with the smallest distance, which is room 8. Continuing in this way, we get the shortest path:\n\nAnswer: 16, 2, 10, 8, 6, 12"
