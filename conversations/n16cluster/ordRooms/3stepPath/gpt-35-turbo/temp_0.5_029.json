Look at all the rooms connected to room 14: rooms 4, 13, 15, and 16. Calculate the distance to each of these rooms:\n   - Room 4: distance 1 (directly connected)\n   - Room 13: distance 2 (14 -> 13)\n   - Room 15: distance 2 (14 -> 13 -> 15)\n   - Room 16: distance 2 (14 -> 16)\n3. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 4.\n4. Look at all the rooms connected to room 4, except for room 14 (to avoid cycles): rooms 13, 15, and 16. Calculate the distance to each of these rooms:\n   - Room 13: distance 2 (14 -> 13)\n   - Room 15: distance 3 (14 -> 13 -> 15)\n   - Room 16: distance 3 (14 -> 16 -> 13 -> 16)\n5. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 13.\n6. Look at all the rooms connected to room 13, except for rooms 14 and 4: rooms 11, 15, and 16. Calculate the distance to each of these rooms:\n   - Room 11: distance 4 (14 -> 13 -> 11)\n   - Room 15: distance 3 (14 -> 13 -> 15)\n   - Room 16: distance 4 (14 -> 16 -> 13 -> 16)\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 15.\n8. Look at all the rooms connected to room 15, except for rooms 14, 4, and 13: rooms 3, 5, and 16. Calculate the distance to each of these rooms:\n   - Room 3: distance 4 (14 -> 13 -> 3)\n   - Room 5: distance 4 (14 -> 13 -> 15 -> 5)\n   - Room 16: distance 4 (14 -> 16 -> 13 -> 16)\n9. Choose the room with the shortest distance, which is room 5.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 5 is: 14, 13, 15, 5.\n\nAnswer: 14, 13, 15, 5"
