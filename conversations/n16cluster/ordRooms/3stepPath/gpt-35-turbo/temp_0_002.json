Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n20. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n21. For each room connected to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance plus the distance from room 7. For example, room 5 is connected to room 7 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance in the table to 3 (2 + 1).\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 0        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 3        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 2        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | 4        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 4        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n22. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 8.\n\n23. Mark room 8 as visited.\n\n24. For each room connected to room 8, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance plus the distance from room"
