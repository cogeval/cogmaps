Assign a tentative distance value to every room: 0 for Room 3 and infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current, and mark it as visited.\n3. For each neighbor of the current room that has not been visited, calculate a tentative distance value. The distance value is the sum of the current room's distance value and the weight of the edge between the current room and the neighbor.\n4. If the tentative distance value of a neighbor is less than its current distance value, update the neighbor's distance value.\n5. When we are done considering all the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new current room then go back to step 3.\n\nAfter applying the algorithm, the shortest path from Room 3 to Room 15 is: 3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15."
