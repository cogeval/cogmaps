Look at all the rooms connected to room 2 (rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16) and calculate their distances from room 2. The distances are 1, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n3. Move to the room with the shortest distance (room 1) and mark it as visited.\n4. Look at all the rooms connected to room 1 (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7) that haven't been visited yet and calculate their distances from room 2. The distances are 1, 2, 2, and 1, respectively.\n5. Move to the room with the shortest distance (room 7) and mark it as visited.\n6. Look at all the rooms connected to room 7 (rooms 1, 5, 6, and 8) that haven't been visited yet and calculate their distances from room 2. The distances are 2, 3, 4, and 2, respectively.\n7. Move to the room with the shortest distance (room 8) and mark it as visited.\n8. Look at all the rooms connected to room 8 (rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10) that haven't been visited yet and calculate their distances from room 2. The distances are 3, 4, 2, and 3, respectively.\n9. Move to the room with the shortest distance (room 10) and mark it as visited.\n10.
