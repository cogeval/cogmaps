The distance to rooms 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. Mark room 3 as visited and set its distance to 0.\n\n2. Look at all the rooms connected to room 3 (rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5). Update their distances if the distance through room 3 is shorter than their current distance. The updated distances are: room 1 - 1, room 2 - 1, room 4 - 1, and room 5 - 2.\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 1) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 2 - 1, room 4 - 1, room 5 - 2, and room 7 - 2.\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 2) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 4 - 1, room 5 - 2, room 7 - 2, and room 16 - 2.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 4) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 5 - 2, room 7 - 2, room 14 - 2, and room 16 - 2.\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 5) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 7 - 2, room 6 - 3, room 8 - 3, and room 14 - 2.\n\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 7) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 6 - 3, room 8 - 3, and room 14 - 2.\n\n8. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 14) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 6 - 3, room 8 - 3, and room 15 - 3.\n\n9. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 6) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 8 - 3, room 12 - 4, and room 15 - 3.\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 8) and repeat step 2. The updated distances are: room 12 - 4 and room 15 - 3.\n\n11. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (room 15) and repeat step 2. There are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 5, 14, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 14, 15"
