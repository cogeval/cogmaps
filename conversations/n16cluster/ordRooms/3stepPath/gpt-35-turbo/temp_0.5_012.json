Initially, set the distance of room 3 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n3. Set the current room to room 3.\n\n4. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance from room 3 to that neighbor, using the distance from room 3 to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor. If this distance is shorter than the current distance of the neighbor in the table, update the distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | 5        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 4        |\n| 16   | 3        |\n\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n6. Set the unvisited room with the shortest distance in the table as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms left, stop.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the current room is room 15.\n\nThe shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 5, 7, 1, 14, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 7, 1, 14, 15"
