            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 3. Set the distance of room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is connected to room 3 and its distance is 1. Since 1 is less than infinity, we update the distance of room 5 to 1.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 5.\n\n5. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n6. For each room connected to room 5, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 3 is already visited and its distance is 0. The distance from room 5 to room 3 is 1, so we update the distance of room 3 to 1.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n8. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n9. For each room connected to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is already visited and its distance is 1. The distance from room 7 to room 5 is 1, so we do not update the distance of room 5.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n10. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 8.\n\n11. Mark room 8 as visited.\n\n12. For each room connected to room 8, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is already visited and its distance is 1. The distance from room 8 to room 5 is 2, so we do not update the distance of room 5.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n13. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 6.\n\n14. Mark room 6 as visited.\n\n15. For each room connected to room 6, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is already visited and its distance is 1. The distance from room 6 to room 5 is 2, so we do not update the distance of room 5.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n16. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 12.\n\n17. Mark room 12 as visited.\n\n18. For each room connected to room 12, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 9 is already visited and its distance is infinity. The distance from room 12 to room 9 is 2, so we update the distance of room 9 to 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n19.

For each room connected to room 9, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 15 is already visited and its distance is infinity. The distance from room 9 to room 15 is 2, so we update the distance of room 15 to 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | 2        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n22.
