            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 3. Set the distance of room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 has a distance of 1 from room 3, so we update its distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 3. In this case, it is room 5.\n\n5. Mark room 5 as visited.\n\n6. For each room connected to room 5 that is unvisited, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance plus the distance from room 5. For example, room 8 has a distance of 2 from room 5, so we update its distance in the table to 3 (1 + 2).\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until room 15 is visited.\n\n8. The shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 5, 8, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8, 15."
