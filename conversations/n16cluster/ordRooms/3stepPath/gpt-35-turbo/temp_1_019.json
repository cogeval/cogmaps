            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use the Dijkstra algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign to every room a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial room and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighbor is the distance from the initial room to the current room, plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new current room then go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is:\n\n3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9 -> 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8, 9, 15"
