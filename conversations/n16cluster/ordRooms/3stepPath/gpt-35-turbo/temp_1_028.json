Starting from room 3, we can calculate the shortest distance to all other rooms in the network. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 3, which has a distance of 0. We will also create a set of unvisited rooms, which initially includes all rooms.\n   - Room 1: infinity\n   - Room 2: infinity\n   - Room 3: 0\n   - Room 4: infinity\n   - Room 5: infinity\n   - Room 6: infinity\n   - Room 7: infinity\n   - Room 8: infinity\n   - Room 9: infinity\n   - Room 10: infinity\n   - Room 11: infinity\n   - Room 12: infinity\n   - Room 13: infinity\n   - Room 14: infinity\n   - Room 15: infinity\n   - Room 16: infinity\n\n2. Set the current room to room 3.\n\n3. For each of the rooms connected to the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the two rooms. If this distance is less than the current distance to that room, update the distance to that room. For example, for room 3, we can update the distances to rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5 as follows:\n   - Room 1: distance = 1 (3 to 1), previous = 3\n   - Room 2: distance = 2 (3 to 2), previous = 3\n   - Room 4: distance = 2 (3 to 4), previous = 3\n   - Room 5: distance = 1 (3 to 5), previous = 3\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n5. If the destination room (room 15) has been visited, we can stop the algorithm and backtrack from room 15 to room 3 to find the shortest path. The shortest path from room 15 to room 3 is:\n   15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 9 -> 12 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 11, 9, 12, 6, 5, 3"
