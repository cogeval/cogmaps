Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 2 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set room 2 as the current room.\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room (room 2). If this distance is less than the tentative distance previously assigned to the neighbor room, update the tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 9) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the shortest tentative distance and set it as the current room. If no such room exists, stop.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 9 is: 2, 8, 9\n\nAnswer: 2, 8, 9"
