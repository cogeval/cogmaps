Here are the steps to apply the algorithm:\n\n1. Assign each room a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial room and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Mark the initial room as visited and set the distance to zero. Put it in a priority queue (heap).\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n  a. Get the room with the minimum distance from the priority queue (let's call it A).\n  b. For each neighbor of A that is not yet visited:\n    i. Calculate the tentative distance to that neighbor through A.\n    ii. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance, update the neighbor's distance and the previous room (to A).\n    iii. Add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n\n4. When the destination room (room 8) is visited, we have found the shortest path. We can backtrack from room 8 to room 4 using the previous room information.\n\nHere is the shortest path from room 4 to room 8:\nAnswer: 4, 1, 8"
