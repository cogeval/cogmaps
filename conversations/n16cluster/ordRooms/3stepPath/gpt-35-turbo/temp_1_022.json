Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the initial node as current.\n2. For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n3. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will never be checked again.\n4. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node, then go back to step 2.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine that the shortest path from Room 3 to Room 15 is:\n\n3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 6, 9, 15"
