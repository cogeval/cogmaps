            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 10, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with the following columns: \"Room\", \"Visited\", \"Distance\", and \"Previous\". Initialize the table with the following values:\n- Room 3: Visited = False, Distance = 0, Previous = None\n- All other rooms: Visited = False, Distance = infinity, Previous = None\n\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest Distance value. In this case, it is room 3.\n\n3. For the current room (room 3), consider all of its neighbors (rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5). Calculate the distance from the current room to each of its neighbors (1 unit for each edge). Update the Distance and Previous columns in the table for each neighbor.\n\n- Room 1: Visited = False, Distance = 1, Previous = 3\n- Room 2: Visited = False, Distance = 1, Previous = 3\n- Room 4: Visited = False, Distance = 1, Previous = 3\n- Room 5: Visited = False, Distance = 1, Previous = 3\n\n4. Mark the current room (room 3) as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 10) is visited.\n\n6. Once the destination room (room 10) is visited, we can trace back the path by following the Previous column in the table. The shortest path from room 3 to room 10 is:\n3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 10\n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 4, 10"
