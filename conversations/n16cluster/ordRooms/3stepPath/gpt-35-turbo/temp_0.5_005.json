Set the distance of room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each adjacent room to room 3, update its distance in the table if it's shorter than the current distance. Then, mark it as visited.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the room with the smallest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 1.\n\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for the chosen room, until room 15 is visited.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | 4        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 4        |\n| 16   | 3        |\n\n6. The shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is 3, 5, 15. \n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 15."
