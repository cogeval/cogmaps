            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table of all the rooms and their distances from room 3. Set the distance of room 3 to 0 and all other rooms to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   0\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   1\n  6  |   2\n  7  |   1\n  8  |   2\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   2\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if the distance through room 3 is shorter than its current distance. \n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |    1\n  2  |    1\n  3  |    0\n  4  |    2\n  5  |    1\n  6  |    2\n  7  |    1\n  8  |    2\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |    2\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 1. Mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room connected to room 1, update its distance in the table if the distance through room 1 is shorter than its current distance.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |    1\n  2  |    1\n  3  |    0\n  4  |    2\n  5  |    1\n  6  |    2\n  7  |    1\n  8  |    2\n  9  |    4\n 10  |    3\n 11  |    5\n 12  |    2\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |    5\n```\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 5. Mark it as visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5-6 until room 15 is visited.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |    1\n  2  |    1\n  3  |    0\n  4  |    2\n  5  |    1\n  6  |    2\n  7  |    1\n  8  |    2\n  9  |    4\n 10  |    3\n 11  |    5\n 12  |    2\n 13  |    6\n 14  |    3\n 15  |    4\n 16  |    5\n```\n\n8. The shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is 3-5-8-10-9-15. Therefore, the answer is:\n```\nAnswer: 3,5,8,10,9,15\n```"
