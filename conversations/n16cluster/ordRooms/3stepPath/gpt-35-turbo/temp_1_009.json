We start by assigning a tentative distance of 0 to room 3, and infinity to all other rooms. We also create a set of unvisited rooms, and add all the rooms to it. \n\n2. We then choose the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which in this case is room 3. \n\n3. We update the tentative distances of the neighboring rooms of room 3 as follows:\n- Room 1: tentative distance is 1 (via room 3)\n- Room 2: tentative distance is 4 (via room 3)\n- Room 4: tentative distance is 2 (via room 3)\n- Room 5: tentative distance is 1 (via room 3)\n\n4.
