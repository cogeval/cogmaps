Initially, set the distance of room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | infinity |\n| 2    | infinity |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | infinity |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | infinity |\n| 10   | infinity |\n| 11   | infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | infinity |\n| 14   | infinity |\n| 15   | infinity |\n| 16   | infinity |\n\n2. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is connected to room 3 and its distance is 1, which is shorter than infinity, so we update its distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | infinity |\n| 2    | infinity |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | infinity |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | infinity |\n| 10   | infinity |\n| 11   | infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | infinity |\n| 14   | infinity |\n| 15   | infinity |\n| 16   | infinity |\n\n4.

For each room connected to room 5, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 3 is already visited and its distance is 0, so we don't update its distance. However, room 6 is connected to room 5 and its distance is 1 + 1 = 2, which is shorter than infinity, so we update its distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | infinity |\n| 2    | infinity |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | infinity |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | infinity |\n| 10   | infinity |\n| 11   | infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | infinity |\n| 14   | infinity |\n| 15   | infinity |\n| 16   | infinity |\n\n7.
