Check the adjacent rooms: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n3. Add the adjacent rooms to a queue, and mark room 3 as visited.\n4. Take the next room from the queue (room 1).\n5. Check the adjacent rooms of room 1: rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7. Since room 3 has already been visited, we skip it. Add rooms 2, 4, and 7 to the queue, and mark room 1 as visited.\n6. Take the next room from the queue (room 2).\n7. Check the adjacent rooms of room 2: rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16. Room 3 has already been visited, so we skip it. Room 15 is not adjacent to room 2, so we skip it as well. Add rooms 1, 4, and 16 to the queue, and mark room 2 as visited.\n8. Take the next room from the queue (room 4).\n9. Check the adjacent rooms of room 4: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 3 and 15 are not adjacent to room 4, so we skip them. Add rooms 1, 2, and 14 to the queue, and mark room 4 as visited.\n10. Take the next room from the queue (room 7).\n11. Check the adjacent rooms of room 7: rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 3 and 15 are not adjacent to room 7, so we skip them. Room 1 and 5 have already been visited, so we skip them too. Add room 8 and 6 to the queue, and mark room 7 as visited.\n12. Take the next room from the queue (room 16).\n13. Check the adjacent rooms of room 16: rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Room 15 is adjacent to room 16, so we have found the shortest path. The path is: 3, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15."
