Consider all the rooms that are directly connected to room 4: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Update their distances as follows: room 1 has a distance of 1, room 2 has a distance of 2, room 3 has a distance of 1, and room 14 has a distance of 1.\n3. Among the rooms that we just considered, choose the one with the smallest distance. In this case, it's room 3.\n4. Consider all the rooms that are directly connected to room 3: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. Update their distances as follows: room 1 already has a distance of 1, room 2 already has a distance of 2, room 4 already has a distance of 2, and room 5 has a distance of 2.\n5. Among the rooms that we just considered, choose the one with the smallest distance. In this case, it's room 4.\n6. Consider all the rooms that are directly connected to room 4: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. We have already updated their distances, so we don't need to do anything here.\n7. Among the rooms that we just considered, choose the one with the smallest distance. In this case, it's room 6.\n8.
