Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of all nodes to infinity except for room 3, which is set to 0.\n2. Set the current node to room 3.\n3. For the current node, calculate the distance to all its neighbors (rooms that it is connected to) and update their distances if they are shorter than the current distances.\n4. Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n5. If the destination node (room 15) has been visited, stop the algorithm and output the shortest path.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node with the shortest distance as the next current node and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 as follows: \n\n3, 5, 6, 12, 9, 15\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 6, 12, 9, 15"
