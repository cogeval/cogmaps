            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 4 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 4. Set the distance of room 4 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | 0        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 4 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 4, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 1 is connected to room 4 and has a distance of 1. Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 0        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 1.\n\n5. Mark room 1 as visited.\n\n6. For each room connected to room 1, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 3 is connected to room 1 and has a distance of 1. Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 0        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 3.\n\n8. Mark room 3 as visited.\n\n9. For each room connected to room 3, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is connected to room 3 and has a distance of 1. Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 0        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n10.

For each room connected to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 8 is connected to room 7 and has a distance of 1. Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 0        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n13. Choose the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 8.\n\n14. Mark room 8 as visited.\n\n15.
