            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with each room as a row and columns for \"visited\" (initially all set to false), \"distance\" (initially set to infinity for all except room 3, which is set to 0), and \"previous\" (initially set to null for all).\n2. Starting with room 3, mark it as visited and set its distance to 0.\n3. For each neighboring room of room 3 (rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5), update its distance to be 1 and set its previous room to be room 3.\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 1) and mark it as visited.\n5. For each neighboring room of room 1 (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7), update its distance to be 2 (since it takes 1 step to get to room 1 and then 1 more step to get to the neighboring room) and set its previous room to be room 1.\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (which is room 2) and mark it as visited.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have visited room 15.\n8. To find the path from room 3 to room 15, start at room 15 and follow the \"previous\" rooms back to room 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 is: 3, 5, 8, 9, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 5, 8, 9, 15."
