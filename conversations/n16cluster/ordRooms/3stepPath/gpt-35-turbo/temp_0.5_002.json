            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 3. Initially, the distance to room 3 is 0 and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  | infinity |\n|   2  | infinity |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  | infinity |\n|   5  | infinity |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  | infinity |\n|   8  | infinity |\n|   9  | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  | infinity |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  | infinity |\n```\n2. Mark room 3 as visited and update the distances of its neighbors: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. The distances are the lengths of the corresponding edges.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  | infinity |\n|   8  | infinity |\n|   9  | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  | infinity |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  | infinity |\n```\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 1 with a distance of 1. Mark it as visited and update the distances of its neighbors: rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  |    2     |\n|   8  | infinity |\n|   9  | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  | infinity |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  | infinity |\n```\n4. Repeat step 3 until room 15 is visited. The next room to visit is room 4 with a distance of 1. Update the distances of its neighbors: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  |    2     |\n|   8  | infinity |\n|   9  | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  |    2     |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  | infinity |\n```\n5. The next room to visit is room 2 with a distance of 1. Update the distances of its neighbors: rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  |    2     |\n|   8  |    2     |\n|   9  | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  |    2     |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  |    2     |\n```\n6.

The next room to visit is room 15 with a distance of 3. Update the distances of its neighbors: rooms 13, 14, and 9.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|   1  |    1     |\n|   2  |    1     |\n|   3  |    0     |\n|   4  |    1     |\n|   5  |    1     |\n|   6  | infinity |\n|   7  |    2     |\n|   8  |    2     |\n|   9  |    4     |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  | infinity |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  |    3     |\n|  14  |    2     |\n|  15  |    3     |\n|  16  |    2     |\n```\n9.
