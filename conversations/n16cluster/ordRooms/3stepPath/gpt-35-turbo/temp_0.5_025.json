            "content": "To find the shortest path from Room 3 to Room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from Room 3. Set the distance of Room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | 5        |\n\n2. Mark Room 3 as visited.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of Room 3 (Rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5), update their distances in the table. The new distances are the sum of the distance to Room 3 and the distance from Room 3 to the neighboring room.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the neighboring room with the smallest distance (Room 1) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each neighboring room of Room 1 (Rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7), update their distances in the table. The new distances are the sum of the distance to Room 1 and the distance from Room 1 to the neighboring room. However, we only update the distances if the new distance is smaller than the current distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | 2        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n6. Choose the neighboring room with the smallest distance (Room 5) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Room 15 is marked as visited.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 2        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | 4        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | 5        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 4        |\n| 16   | 3        |\n\n8.
