            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 5, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 14. Set the distance of room 14 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 14 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 14, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 4 is adjacent to room 14 and its distance is 1. Update the table as follows:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |    1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (in this case, room 4) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room adjacent to room 4, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 1 is adjacent to room 4 and its distance is 2. Update the table as follows:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |    2\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |    1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |    0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance (in this case, room 1) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until room 5 is visited. The final table will be:\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |    2\n  2  |    3\n  3  |    4\n  4  |    1\n  5  |    5\n  6  |    6\n  7  |    5\n  8  |    6\n  9  |   10\n 10  |    5\n 11  |    9\n 12  |    8\n 13  |    5\n 14  |    0\n 15  |    6\n 16  |    2\n```\n\n8. To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 5, we can trace back the path from room 5 to room 14 using the table. Starting from room 5, we see that the shortest path goes to room 3 (distance 4), then to room 1 (distance 2), and finally to room 4 (distance 1), which is adjacent to room 14. Therefore, the shortest path from room 14 to room 5 is: 14, 4, 1, 3, 5.\n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 1, 3, 5"
