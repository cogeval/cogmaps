Assign a tentative distance of zero to the starting room (Room 2) and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark the starting room as visited.\n3. For the current room (Room 2), calculate the tentative distances to its neighboring rooms (Rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16). These distances are equal to the sum of the current room's distance plus the weight of the edge between the current room and the neighboring room.\n4. Select the neighboring room with the smallest tentative distance and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we reach the destination room (Room 11).\n6. Return the path to Room 11.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following path from Room 2 to Room 11:\n\n2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11\n\nTherefore, the answer is: `Answer: 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11`"
