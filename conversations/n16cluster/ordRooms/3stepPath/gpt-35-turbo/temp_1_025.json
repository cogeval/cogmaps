Starting from room 3, we can consider the neighboring rooms and assign tentative distances to them. Then, we can select the room with the smallest tentative distance and repeat the process until we reach room 15. The shortest path would be the sum of the tentative distances.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at room 3 with a tentative distance of 0.\n2. Consider the neighboring rooms: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n3. Assign tentative distances to these rooms based on their distance from room 3:\n\n   - Room 1: tentative distance = 1\n   - Room 2: tentative distance = 1\n   - Room 4: tentative distance = 1\n   - Room 5: tentative distance = 1\n\n4. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 1.\n5. Consider the neighboring rooms of room 1 that have not been visited: rooms 2, 4, and 7.\n6. Assign tentative distances to these rooms based on their distance from room 1:\n\n   - Room 2: tentative distance = 2\n   - Room 4: tentative distance = 2\n   - Room 7: tentative distance = 2\n\n7. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 2.\n8. Consider the neighboring rooms of room 2 that have not been visited: rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16.\n9. Assign tentative distances to these rooms based on their distance from room 2:\n\n   - Room 1: tentative distance = 3\n   - Room 3: tentative distance = 3\n   - Room 4: tentative distance = 3\n   - Room 16: tentative distance = 3\n\n10. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 3.\n11. Consider the neighboring rooms of room 3 that have not been visited: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. However, since these rooms have already been visited, we skip them.\n12. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 4.\n13. Consider the neighboring rooms of room 4 that have not been visited: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14.\n14. Assign tentative distances to these rooms based on their distance from room 4:\n\n   - Room 1: tentative distance = 4\n   - Room 2: tentative distance = 4\n   - Room 3: tentative distance = 4\n   - Room 14: tentative distance = 4\n\n15. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 14.\n16. Consider the neighboring rooms of room 14 that have not been visited: rooms 4, 13, 15, and 16.\n17. Assign tentative distances to these rooms based on their distance from room 14:\n\n   - Room 4: tentative distance = 5\n   - Room 13: tentative distance = 5\n   - Room 15: tentative distance = 5\n   - Room 16: tentative distance = 5\n\n18. Select the room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 15.\n19. Since we have reached room 15, we have found the shortest path from room 3 to room 15. The path is: 3, 4, 14, 15.\n\nAnswer: 3, 4, 14, 15"
