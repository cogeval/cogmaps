            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 1. Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | \u221e                    |\n| 3    | \u221e                    |\n| 4    | \u221e                    |\n| 5    | \u221e                    |\n| 6    | \u221e                    |\n| 7    | \u221e                    |\n| 8    | \u221e                    |\n| 9    | \u221e                    |\n| 10   | \u221e                    |\n| 11   | \u221e                    |\n| 12   | \u221e                    |\n| 13   | \u221e                    |\n| 14   | \u221e                    |\n| 15   | \u221e                    |\n| 16   | \u221e                    |\n\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited and set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For the current room, update the distance to all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet. For example, the distance to room 2 is 1, the distance to room 3 is 1, the distance to room 4 is 1, and the distance to room 7 is 1. Update the table accordingly.\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | 1                    |\n| 3    | 1                    |\n| 4    | 1                    |\n| 5    | \u221e                    |\n| 6    | \u221e                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | \u221e                    |\n| 9    | \u221e                    |\n| 10   | \u221e                    |\n| 11   | \u221e                    |\n| 12   | \u221e                    |\n| 13   | \u221e                    |\n| 14   | \u221e                    |\n| 15   | \u221e                    |\n| 16   | \u221e                    |\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited.\n\n6. The shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is the sequence of rooms with the shortest distances. Here, the shortest distance to room 12 is 3, which can be achieved by going from room 1 to room 4 to room 11 to room 12. Therefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 4, 11, 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 11, 12."
