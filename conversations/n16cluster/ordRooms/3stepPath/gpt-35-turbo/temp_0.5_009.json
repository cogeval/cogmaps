Initially, set the distance of Room 3 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | Infinity |\n| 2    | Infinity |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | Infinity |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | Infinity |\n| 10   | Infinity |\n| 11   | Infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | Infinity |\n| 14   | Infinity |\n| 15   | Infinity |\n| 16   | Infinity |\n\n2. Mark Room 3 as visited and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | Infinity |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | Infinity |\n| 10   | Infinity |\n| 11   | Infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | Infinity |\n| 14   | Infinity |\n| 15   | Infinity |\n| 16   | Infinity |\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (Room 1) and repeat step 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | Infinity |\n| 10   | Infinity |\n| 11   | Infinity |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | Infinity |\n| 14   | Infinity |\n| 15   | Infinity |\n| 16   | Infinity |\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until Room 15 is visited.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 0        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 1        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 3        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 3        |\n| 13   | 5        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 4        |\n| 16   | 3        |\n\n5.
