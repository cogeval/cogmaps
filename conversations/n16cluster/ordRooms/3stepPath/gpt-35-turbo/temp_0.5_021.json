            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table to keep track of the distance from the starting room (room 3) to each room. Initialize the distance to infinity for all rooms except the starting room, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a set to keep track of visited rooms. Initialize it to contain only the starting room.\n3. While there are unvisited rooms:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance from the starting room.\n   b. For each neighbor of the chosen room that is still unvisited, calculate the distance from the starting room to that neighbor through the chosen room. If this distance is smaller than the current distance recorded for the neighbor, update the distance in the table.\n   c. Mark the chosen room as visited.\n4. Once all rooms have been visited, the distance table will contain the shortest distance from the starting room to each room. The shortest path from room 3 to room 15 can be found by tracing backwards from room 15 using the distance table.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 3 to room 15 as: 3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15\n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 10, 9, 15"
