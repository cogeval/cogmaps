Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

If we find a neighbor that has already been visited and is not a parent of the current node, then we have found a cycle, which is a densely-connected cluster. We repeat this process until all rooms have been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in this world:\n\n- Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, and 16\n- Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Room 13\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
