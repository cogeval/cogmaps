One way to approach this is by using a graph representation of the rooms and their connections. From the given information, we can construct a graph with 16 vertices (one for each room) and edges connecting the rooms that are connected to each other.\n\nUsing this graph representation, we can apply a clustering algorithm such as the connected components algorithm to identify the densely-connected clusters. The connected components algorithm identifies groups of vertices in a graph that are connected to each other but not to the rest of the graph. Each group of vertices identified by the algorithm represents a densely-connected cluster in the graph.\n\nApplying the connected components algorithm to the graph representation of the rooms and their connections, we get three densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Rooms {1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16}\n2. Rooms {5, 6, 7, 8}\n3. Rooms {9, 10, 11, 12, 13}\n\nTherefore, the answer to the given question is:\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
