Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To solve this task, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent each room as a vertex in a graph, and each connection between two rooms as an edge between the corresponding vertices. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to find all the clusters of vertices that are densely connected.\n\nStarting from any vertex, we can perform a depth-first search to visit all the vertices that are connected to it with at most 2 edges. After visiting all such vertices, we mark them as visited and start a new search from the next unvisited vertex. We repeat this process until all vertices have been visited. The number of times we start a new search is equal to the number of densely-connected clusters of vertices.\n\nUsing this approach, we can find that there are 3 densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
