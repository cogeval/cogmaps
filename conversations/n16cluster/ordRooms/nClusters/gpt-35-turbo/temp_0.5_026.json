            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent each room as a node in the graph and the connections between rooms as edges. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to find all the connected components in the graph. \n\nUsing the given connections between rooms, we can create the following adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nUsing depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, we can traverse the graph and find all the connected components. A DFS algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the connected components.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.\n3. For each node in the graph, if the node has not been visited, perform a DFS starting from that node.\n4. During the DFS, mark each visited node as visited and add it to the current connected component.\n5. When the DFS is complete, add the current connected component to the list of connected components.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the following connected components:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 12, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n```\n\nAnswer: there are 1 clusters."
