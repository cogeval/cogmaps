Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

We start by picking a room and exploring all the rooms that are connected to it. Then, we pick another unexplored room and repeat the process until all rooms have been explored. During the exploration, we keep track of the number of rooms in each cluster. If a cluster has more than 2 rooms connected to each other, we count it as a densely-connected cluster. \n\nUsing this algorithm, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n\n- Cluster 1: Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, and 16\n- Cluster 2: Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Cluster 3: Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Cluster 4: Room 13\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
