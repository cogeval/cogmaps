Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To find the densely-connected clusters of rooms, we need to apply a graph theory approach. We can represent each room as a node and the connections between them as edges. Then, we can use a depth-first search algorithm to explore the graph and find the clusters. \n\nStarting with any unvisited room, we can explore all the rooms that are connected to it with one edge, marking them as visited. Then, we can explore all the unvisited rooms that are connected to any of the previous rooms with one edge. If we find a room that is connected to two or more visited rooms, we can mark it as part of the same cluster. We repeat this process until all rooms have been visited.\n\nAfter applying this algorithm, we find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world:\n- Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Rooms 13, 14, 15, and 16\n- Room 6 and 12 (connected to themselves with one edge)\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
