Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To find the densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent each room as a node and the connections between them as edges. Then, we can use an algorithm to find the clusters.\n\nOne such algorithm is Depth-First Search (DFS). We can start from any node and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. During the exploration, we can mark the nodes that we have visited. Once we have explored all the nodes that are reachable from the starting node, we can move to an unvisited node and repeat the process. We can count the number of times we start a new DFS traversal as the number of clusters.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
