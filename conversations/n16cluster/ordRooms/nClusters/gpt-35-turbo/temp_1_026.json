Starting from each room, we can visit its neighbors and continue visiting the neighbors of its neighbors until we find all the rooms that are connected to it within a max distance of 2 rooms.\n\nAfter applying the algorithm, we can see that there are 6 densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world: \n\n- Cluster 1: Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, and 16\n- Cluster 2: Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Cluster 3: Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Cluster 4: Room 13\n- Cluster 5: Room 15\n- Cluster 6: Room 16\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters."
