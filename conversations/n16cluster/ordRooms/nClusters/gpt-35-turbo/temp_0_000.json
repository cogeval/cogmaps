A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

We can represent each room as a node and the connections between rooms as edges. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to identify the clusters of nodes that are densely connected.\n\nOne such algorithm is Depth-First Search (DFS). We can start from any node and explore its neighbors recursively. If we encounter a node that has already been visited, we know that we have found a densely-connected cluster. We can mark all the nodes in this cluster as visited and continue the DFS from the next unvisited node.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n- Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, and 16\n- Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Room 13\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 4 clusters."
