Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

For example, the element (1,2) in the matrix will be 1 if there is a connection between rooms 1 and 2, and 0 otherwise. \n\nUsing this matrix, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on each room to identify all the rooms that are connected to it within 2 steps. If a group of connected rooms is identified, we can mark them and move on to the next unmarked room. \n\nAfter performing the DFS on all the rooms, we will have identified all the densely-connected clusters of rooms in the world.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
