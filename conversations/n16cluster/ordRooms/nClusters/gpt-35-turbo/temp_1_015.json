Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To find the densely-connected clusters of rooms, we can use the concept of Depth First Search (DFS). We start by choosing a room and traversing all the rooms that are connected to it. While traversing, we mark each visited room and continue until we reach a room that does not have any unvisited connected rooms. We repeat the same process for all the unvisited rooms until all the rooms have been marked. \n\nAfter completing the DFS traversal, the number of clusters of rooms will be equal to the number of times we performed the DFS algorithm. \n\nBased on the given connections between rooms, we can create a graph where each room is represented as a node, and the connections between rooms are represented as edges. \n\nFollowing is the graph representation of the given connections: \n\n```\n1--2--16--13--14--4--3--5--6--7--8--10--9--12--11--15\n```\nPerforming the DFS algorithm, we can see that there are 4 clusters of rooms in this world. \n\nCluster 1: Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, and 16\nCluster 2: Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\nCluster 3: Room 9, 10, 11, and 12\nCluster 4: Room 17 (not connected to any other room)\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
