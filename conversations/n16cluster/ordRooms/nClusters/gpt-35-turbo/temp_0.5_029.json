A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

Each room can be represented as a node in a graph, and the connections between the rooms can be represented as edges between the nodes. \n\nWe can start by identifying the clusters of rooms that are densely-connected. To do this, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each room. If a DFS traversal from a room visits at least two other rooms, then those three rooms form a densely-connected cluster. We can mark these rooms as visited and continue the DFS traversal from any unvisited room.\n\nAfter performing the DFS traversal from all unvisited rooms, we will have identified all the densely-connected clusters in the graph. We can count the number of clusters and return the result.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
