Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To find the number of densely-connected clusters of rooms in this world, we can use the concept of graph theory. The given 16 rooms can be represented as vertices of a graph, and the connections between them can be represented as edges between the vertices. \n\nTo start, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph and find all the connected components. For each component, we can check if it is densely-connected by checking if there is any pair of vertices that are more than two edges away from each other. If there is no such pair, then the component is densely-connected.\n\nAfter applying DFS to the graph, we get the following connected components:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16}\n2. {5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12}\n3. {9, 13}\n\nComponent 1 is not densely-connected, as room 14 is three edges away from room 16. Component 2 is densely-connected, as all pairs of vertices are at most two edges away from each other. Component 3 is also densely-connected, as there are only two rooms in the component.\n\nTherefore, the total number of densely-connected clusters of rooms is 2.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters."
