Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

Then, we can move on to the next unvisited room (Room 5) and visit all of its connected rooms (6, 7, 8, and 3). We can repeat this process until all rooms have been visited.\n\nDuring the DFS, we can keep track of the visited rooms and the number of clusters we have found. Whenever we encounter a room that has already been visited, we know that we have found a densely-connected cluster.\n\nAfter running DFS on all unvisited rooms, we should have identified all densely-connected clusters of rooms in the world.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
