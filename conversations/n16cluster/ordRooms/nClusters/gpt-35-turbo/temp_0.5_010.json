Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 rooms."

We start from a room and explore all its neighbors recursively until we reach a room that has no unexplored neighbors. Then we backtrack and explore the unexplored neighbors of the previous room. We repeat this process until we have explored all the rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters:\n- Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, and 16\n- Rooms 5, 6, 7, and 8\n- Rooms 9, 10, 11, and 12\n- Room 13\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 4 clusters."
