We need to find densely-connected clusters, which are groups of at least 2 rooms that are connected to each other.\n3. Room 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 4 and 7. This forms a cluster of 5 rooms (1, 2, 3, 4, 7).\n4. Room 2 is connected to rooms 1, 3, 4, 16. This adds room 16 to the cluster, making it 6 rooms (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 16).\n5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 4, 5. This adds room 5 to the cluster, making it 7 rooms (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 16).\n6. Room 4 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, 14. This adds room 14 to the cluster, making it 8 rooms (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 16).\n7. Room 5 is connected to rooms 3, 6, 7, 8. This forms a new cluster of 5 rooms (3, 5, 6, 7, 8). \n8. The remaining rooms (9-13, 15) do not form any new densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: There are 2 clusters"
