Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

I started by creating a graph of the rooms and their connections.\n2. I then used a depth-first search algorithm to visit all of the rooms in the graph.\n3. As I visited each room, I kept track of the rooms that I had already visited.\n4. If I visited a room that I had already visited, then I knew that I had found a densely-connected cluster.\n\nI confirmed that each cluster had a minimum of 2 rooms by checking the number of connections for each room in the cluster.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters\n```\n\nI apologize for the previous mistake. I have double-checked my work, and I am confident that the answer is correct now."
