Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. How many densely-connected clusters of rooms are there in this world? A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

This algorithm works by starting at a single node and exploring all of its neighbors. If a neighbor is not already in the cluster, it is added to the cluster. This process continues until no more new nodes can be added to the cluster.\n\nIn this case, the connected components algorithm found three clusters. The first cluster contains rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This cluster is densely connected because all of the rooms are connected to each other. The second cluster contains rooms 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. This cluster is also densely connected because all of the rooms are connected to each other. The third cluster contains rooms 13, 14, 15, and 16. This cluster is not as densely connected as the other two clusters, but it is still considered to be a cluster because it contains at least two rooms that are connected to each other.\n\nI hope this helps!"
