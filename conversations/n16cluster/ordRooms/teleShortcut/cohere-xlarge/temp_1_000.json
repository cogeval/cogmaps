Please make sure to test and submit your code before the end of the hackathon.\n\nWinners will be selected by a group of judges. This is a learning competition so you can get feedback from the judges. However, judges will only provide feedback to the top 3 winners.\n\nAll tests are automatically graded online. Test cases are hidden so that you can only focus on writing code without worrying about the test cases.\n\nClick on \"Register\" on the top right corner of this page and fill out the registration form. You will receive an email with instructions to complete your registration.\n\nWe have a slack group for all MLHers. Slack is a great place to meet other participants, get feedback and find a team.\n\nWe will run online workshops to help you learn new skills and answer any questions you about the hackathon.\n\nIf you don't have a team, don't worry!
