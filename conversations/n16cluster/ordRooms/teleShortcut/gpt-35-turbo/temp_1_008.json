Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Each room will be represented as a node and the connections between rooms will be represented as edges.\n\n1 -- 2 -- 16\n|    | \n3 -- 4    14\n|         |\n5 -- 6 -- 7\n|    |    |\n8    12   |\n|    |    |\n9 -- 10 --11 --13 --15 --16\n\nNext, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 16, while also taking into account the rewards and penalties associated with each room.\n\n1. Start at room 1 with a reward of 0.\n2. Explore the neighboring rooms (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7) and calculate the total reward for each path.\n   - Path 1-2 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Path 1-3 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Path 1-4 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Path 1-7 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n3. Choose the path with the highest reward and mark the destination room as visited.\n   - Choose path 1-2 and mark room 2 as visited.\n4. Repeat step 2 for the neighboring rooms of the newly visited room (room 2).\n   - Path 2-16 yields a reward of 0 + 5 = 5\n   - Path 2-3 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Path 2-4 yields a reward of 0 + 0 = 0\n5. Choose the path with the highest reward and mark the destination room as visited.\n   - Choose path 2-16 and mark room 16 as visited.\n6. Since room 16 is the destination, we have found the path with the highest reward (5).\n   - Path: 1, 2, 16\n   - Total reward: 5\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 to room 16 is 1-2-16. Answer: 1, 2, 16."
