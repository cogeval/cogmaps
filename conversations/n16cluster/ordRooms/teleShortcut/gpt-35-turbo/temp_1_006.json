Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

We start at room 1 with a reward of 0 and visit each neighboring room, updating their reward with the sum of their previous reward and the reward gained from moving to that room. We continue visiting the neighboring rooms with the highest reward until we reach room 16. The penalty for visiting room 5 is taken into account by subtracting 15 from the reward whenever we move to room 5.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the path that yields the most reward from room 1 to room 16 is:\n\n1, 2, 16\n\nThe total reward earned is 5 (for room 16) - 15 (penalty for room 5) + 10 (for room 10) = 0. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 16"
