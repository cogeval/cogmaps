Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

We start at room 1 and calculate the shortest path to all other rooms, taking into account the rewards and penalties.\n\nThe shortest path to room 16 has a reward of 5, so we can add that to our total reward. The shortest path to room 10 has a reward of 10, so we can add that as well. However, the shortest path to room 5 has a penalty of 15, so we should avoid that room.\n\nHere is the path that yields the most reward: \n\n1 -> 2 -> 16 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10\n\nTotal reward: 20 (5 for room 16 and 15 for room 10)\n\nAnswer: 1,2,16,13,11,10"
