First, we create a table with the distance from room 1 to each room, initialized as infinity for all rooms except room 1, which is initialized as 0. We also create a table to keep track of the maximum reward we can get from each room, initialized as 0 for all rooms except rooms 10 and 15, which are initialized as 50 and 10, respectively.\n\n2. We add all rooms to a priority queue, ordered by the distance from room 1. We start with room 1.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, we take the room with the smallest distance from room 1 and update the distances and rewards of its neighboring rooms. If the new reward for a neighboring room is greater than its current maximum reward, we update the maximum reward for that room. We also update the distance of each neighboring room as the sum of the distance from room 1 to the current room and the distance from the current room to the neighboring room. \n\n4. We repeat step 3 until we reach room 10 or 15. Once we reach one of these rooms, we stop and output the path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following path:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThis path has a length of 4 and a reward of 50, which is the maximum reward we can get starting from room 1. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 5, 8, 10"
