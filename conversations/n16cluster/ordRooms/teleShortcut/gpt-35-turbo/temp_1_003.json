Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to calculate the distances from room 1 to rooms 10 and 15, respectively, and then compare the rewards. The distances can be calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and infinity for the other rooms.\n2. Mark all rooms unvisited and create a set of all the unvisited rooms.\n3. For the current room (which is initially room 1), consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighbor is the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge between the two rooms.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat from step 3 until you have visited all the rooms.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we obtain the following tentative distances:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: 2\nRoom 6: 3\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 8: 2\nRoom 9: 4\nRoom 10: 3\nRoom 11: 5\nRoom 12: 4\nRoom 13: 6\nRoom 14: 5\nRoom 15: 5\nRoom 16: 6\n\nThus, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is to go to room 10. The reward is 50, which is higher than the reward of 10 in room 15. The path is: \n\n1, 7, 8, 10\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 8, 10."

To do this, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm again, but this time we need to consider room 17 as a new neighbor of room 1, with a weight of zero. Also, we need to update the tentative distances for the rooms that can be reached from room 12 through the portal. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and infinity for the other rooms.\n2. Mark all rooms unvisited and create a set of all the unvisited rooms.\n3.

The reward is 10, which is the highest among the rewards of all the reachable rooms. The path is:\n\n1, 17, 12, 11\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Answer: 1, 17, 12, 11."
