Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Starting at room 1, we can find the shortest paths to all other rooms in the graph while keeping track of the rewards and penalties associated with each path. We can then select the path that yields the highest total reward.\n\nHere is the path that yields the most reward:\n\n1, 4, 14, 15, 13, 11, 10, 8, 5, 6, 12, 9, 16, 2\n\nThis path has a total reward of 20 (5 for room 16 and 15 for room 13) and a total penalty of 15 (for room 5)."
