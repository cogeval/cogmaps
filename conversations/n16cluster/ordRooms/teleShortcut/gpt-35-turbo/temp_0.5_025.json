Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward found along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all rooms except room 1 with distance infinity and maximum reward 0. Initialize room 1 with distance 0 and maximum reward 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add room 1 to it.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the room with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   b. For each adjacent room:\n      i. Calculate the distance to the adjacent room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between them.\n      ii. If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance to the adjacent room, update the distance and maximum reward of the adjacent room.\n      iii. If the maximum reward of the adjacent room is larger than the maximum reward found so far, update the maximum reward found so far.\n      iv. Add the adjacent room to the priority queue.\n4. The shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 1 and ends at the room with the highest maximum reward found.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 1, goes to room 7 (reward 0), then to room 8 (reward 0), then to room 10 (reward 50). The total distance is 3 and the total reward is 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
