Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a table to store the distance from room 1 to each room and the previous room on the path.\n2. Initialize the distance to all rooms except room 1 to infinity and the distance to room 1 to 0.\n3. Create a set of unvisited rooms and add all rooms to it.\n4. While there are unvisited rooms, select the room with the smallest distance from room 1 and remove it from the set.\n5. For each neighbor of the selected room, calculate the distance from room 1 through the selected room to the neighbor and update the table if the new distance is smaller than the previous distance.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all rooms are visited or the distance to all remaining rooms is infinity.\n7. Trace the shortest path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward.\n\nBased on this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: \n\n1 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThe reward collected on this path is 50, which is the maximum reward that can be collected starting from room 1 and passing through room 8.
