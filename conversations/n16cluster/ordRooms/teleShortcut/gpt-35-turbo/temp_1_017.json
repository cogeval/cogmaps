Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Room 17 is connected to room 12 and room 12 is connected to four other rooms: 9, 10, 11, and 6. We can treat this as having teleportation edges between room 17 and rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1, we can see that we can reach rooms 2, 3, 4, 7, and 17. The highest reward chest is still in room 10 with a reward of 50. \n\nTo reach room 10, we can either go to room 2 and then use the path 2 \u2192 8 \u2192 10 for a total distance of 3 and a total reward of 50. Alternatively, we can use the teleportation portal from room 17 to reach room 10 in just one step, for a total distance of 2 and a total reward of 50.\n\nSo the shortest path that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 17, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 17, 10"
