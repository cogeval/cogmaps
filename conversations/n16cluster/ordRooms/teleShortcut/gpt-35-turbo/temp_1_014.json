Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We visit the adjacent rooms of room 1, which are rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7. We update their distances to 1 and their maximum rewards to 0, since there are no chests in these rooms.\n\n3. We then visit the adjacent rooms of room 2, which are rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16. We update their distances to 2 and their maximum rewards to 50 for room 10 and 0 for all other rooms.\n\n4.
