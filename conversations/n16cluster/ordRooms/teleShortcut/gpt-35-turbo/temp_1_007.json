Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, the algorithm suggests the following path:\n\n1 \u2192 7 \u2192 5 \u2192 8 \u2192 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 0 since none of the rooms in this path contains a chest. Therefore, I will backtrack and consider other possible paths that lead to the chests. \n\nThe first chest with a reward of 50 is in room 10. One possible path from room 1 to room 10 that collects this chest is:\n\n1 \u2192 7 \u2192 8 \u2192 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, which is the maximum reward possible in this world. \n\nThe second chest with a reward of 10 is in room 15. One possible path from room 1 to room 15 that collects this chest is:\n\n1 \u2192 7 \u2192 5 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 14 \u2192 15\n\nThis path has a total reward of 10. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 \u2192 7 \u2192 8 \u2192 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"

After collecting the reward in room 15, we can teleport to any neighbor of room 12 to shorten the path back to room 1. The neighbor that provides the shortest path is room 9, which is connected to room 12 and room 1. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 with the teleportation portal available is:\n\n1 \u2192 7 \u2192 5 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 14 \u2192 15 \u2192 9 \u2192 12 \u2192 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 7 \u2192 1\n\nThis path has a total reward of 10, which is the maximum reward possible in this world. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 5, 3, 4, 14, 15, 9, 12, 6, 5, 7, 1"
