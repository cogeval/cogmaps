Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Calculate the shortest path from room 1 to room 10 using Dijkstra's algorithm. The path is: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10. The reward for this path is 0, since there is no chest with a reward on this path.\n\n2. Calculate the shortest path from room 1 to room 15 using Dijkstra's algorithm. The path is: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 15. The reward for this path is 10, since there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15.\n\n3. Compare the rewards for the two paths. The path to room 10 has a reward of 0, while the path to room 15 has a reward of 10. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is the path to room 15: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 5, 3, 15"

Here are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Add room 17 to the graph and connect it to room 1.\n2. Calculate the shortest paths from room 1 to each room using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n3. Compare the rewards of the paths to room 10, 11, and 15.\n4. Choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nHere are the shortest paths and rewards for each room:\n\n- Room 10: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10. Reward: 0\n- Room 11: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 11. Reward: 0\n- Room 15: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 15. Reward: 10\n\nTo reach room 10 or room 11, we need to teleport from room 17 to one of the neighboring rooms of room 12. We can see that the shortest path to room 10 and room 11 is via room 12. Therefore, we can choose the path to room 15, which has the highest reward and doesn't require any teleportation.\n\nSo, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 5, 3, 15"
