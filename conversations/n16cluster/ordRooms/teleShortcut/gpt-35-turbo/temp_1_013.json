Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once. From room 1, what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward, we can use a depth-first search algorithm and keep track of the current reward and the visited rooms. Starting from room 1, we can visit each connected room recursively and calculate the total reward until we reach room 16. However, we need to make sure not to visit room 5 as it incurs a penalty. Additionally, we can stop exploring a path if the total reward is less than the maximum reward found so far.\n\nThe path that yields the most reward is: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16, 2, 8, 10\n\nExplanation: \n\n- Starting from room 1, we have three options: 2, 3, and 4. We choose room 4 since it has the highest reward (5).\n- From room 4, we have four options: 1, 2, 3, and 14. We skip room 1 since we already visited it, and skip room 5 due to the penalty. We choose room 14 since it has the highest reward (10).\n- From room 14, we have four options: 4, 13, 15, and 16. We skip room 5 and choose room 13 since it has the highest reward (0). \n- From room 13, we have four options: 11, 9, 15, and 16. We skip room 15 and choose room 16 since it has the highest reward (5).\n- From room 16, we have four options: 2, 13, 14, and 15. We skip room 5 and choose room 2 since it has the highest reward (5).\n- From room 2, we have four options: 1, 3, 4, and 16. We skip room 16 and choose room 8 since it has the highest reward (5).\n- From room 8, we have four options: 5, 6, 7, and 10. We skip room 5 and 7, choose room 6 since it has the highest reward (0).\n- From room 6, we have four options: 5, 7, 8, and 12. We skip room 5, choose room 7 since it has the highest reward (0).\n- From room 7, we have three options: 5, 6, and 8. We choose room 10 since it has the highest reward (10).\n- We reached room 10, which has the highest reward, so we stop exploring.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16, 2, 8, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16, 2, 8, 10"
