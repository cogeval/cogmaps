Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The feedback from the teams during the moderation stage was mostly positive, saying the difficulty was very good. But the comments, especially from 'newbie' teams, indicated they needed more guidance from the facilitators on providing hints, especially during the pre-round period. We definitely had to improve on providing hints to all the teams, regardless of their ability. This is especially important when using the 'Leaderboard' method. In our situation, we realised the 'Rosie Assistant' team was doing the same thing as the 'newbie' teams and therefore we had to provide them appropriate hints to ensure they were not left out. We also felt a leaderboard method to select teams for moderation might not be the best choice.\nAs the competition went on, we realised this was a good round for some teams.
