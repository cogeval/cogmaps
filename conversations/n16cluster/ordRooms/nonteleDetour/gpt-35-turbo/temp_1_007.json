Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and you have been told that there is no connection between room 13  and 11 and also there is no connection between room 15 and room 9. From room 1,  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

We can also avoid the penalty by avoiding room 5.\n\nFrom room 1, the next highest reward is room 10 (reward of 10), so we go to room 10. From room 10, the next highest rewards are rooms 12 (reward of 0) and 9 (reward of 0), so we choose room 12. From room 12, the next highest rewards are rooms 11 (reward of 0) and 9 (reward of 0), so we choose room 11. From room 11, the next highest reward is room 13 (reward of 0), so we choose room 13. From room 13, the next highest reward is room 14 (reward of 0), so we choose room 14. From room 14, the only remaining connected room is room 16 (reward of 5), so we choose room 16.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is: 1, 10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 16.\n\nAnswer: 1, 10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 16"
