Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and you have been told that there is no connection between room 13  and 11 and also there is no connection between room 15 and room 9. From room 1,  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."
