Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial current room as room 1.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances as the sum of the current room's distance plus the reward of the neighbor room's chest.\n4. Compare each neighbor's tentative distance to its current distance. If it is smaller, update the neighbor's distance and set its previous room to the current room.\n5. When we have finished considering all of the current room's neighbors, mark the current room as visited.\n6. From the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the current room. If there is no such room, we are done.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until we have visited the room with the highest reward or there are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 \n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, which is the maximum possible reward starting from room 1 and passing through both chests. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
