We repeat the process for each of the connected rooms to find the total reward of the path and choose the one with the highest reward:\n\n- Path 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 has a total reward of 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 = 50\n- Path 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 12 -> 9 -> 10 has a total reward of 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n- Path 1 -> 2 -> 16 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 has a total reward of 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n- Path 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 6 -> 12 -> 9 -> 15 has a total reward of 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 10\n- Path 1 -> 4 -> 14 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 has a total reward of 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 with a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
