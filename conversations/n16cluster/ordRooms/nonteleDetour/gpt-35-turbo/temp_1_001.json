Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Mark Room 1 with a distance of 0.\n\n2. From Room 1, calculate the distances to all its adjacent rooms (Rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7). Update the distance of each adjacent room to the reward of the chest in that room. So, Room 2 has a distance of 0 (no chest), Room 3 has a distance of 50, Room 4 has a distance of 0 (no chest), and Room 7 has a distance of 0 (no chest).\n\n3. Among the adjacent rooms, select the one with the shortest distance and mark it as visited. In this case, Room 2 has the shortest distance (0), so we mark it as visited.\n\n4. From Room 2, calculate the distances to all its adjacent rooms (Rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16). Update the distance of each adjacent room to the reward of the chest in that room. So, Room 1 has a distance of 0 (no chest), Room 3 has a distance of 50, Room 4 has a distance of 0 (no chest), and Room 16 has a distance of 0 (no chest).\n\n5.

Among the adjacent rooms that are not visited, select the one with the shortest distance and mark it as visited. In this case, all the adjacent rooms have a distance of 0, so we can choose any of them. Let's choose Room 1.\n\n8. We have reached the destination (Room 1 to Room 3 to Room 1). The path that yields the most reward is Room 3, which has a chest with a reward of 50. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is: 1, 3. \n\nAnswer: 1, 3"
