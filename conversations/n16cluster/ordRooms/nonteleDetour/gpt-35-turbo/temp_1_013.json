We will keep track of the shortest distance to each node and the previous node on the path.\n\nStarting at room 1:\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: Infinity\nRoom 3: Infinity\nRoom 4: Infinity\nRoom 5: Infinity\nRoom 6: Infinity\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: Infinity\nRoom 9: Infinity\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: Infinity\nRoom 12: Infinity\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 10\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: None\nRoom 3: None\nRoom 4: None\nRoom 5: None\nRoom 6: None\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: None\nRoom 9: None\nRoom 10: None\nRoom 11: None\nRoom 12: None\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: None\nRoom 15: None\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 1:\nVisit room 1\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: Infinity\nRoom 9: Infinity\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: Infinity\nRoom 12: Infinity\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: 1\nRoom 6: 1\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: None\nRoom 9: None\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: None\nRoom 12: None\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: None\nRoom 15: 1\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 2:\nVisit room 5\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: 50\nRoom 9: Infinity\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: Infinity\nRoom 12: Infinity\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: None\nRoom 6: 5\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: 5\nRoom 9: None\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: None\nRoom 12: None\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: None\nRoom 15: 1\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 3:\nVisit room 15\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: 50\nRoom 9: 10\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 100\nRoom 12: 100\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: None\nRoom 6: 5\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: 5\nRoom 9: 15\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 15\nRoom 12: 5\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: None\nRoom 15: None\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 4:\nVisit room 9\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 10\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: 50\nRoom 9: 10\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 100\nRoom 12: 50\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: 15\nRoom 6: 5\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: 5\nRoom 9: None\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 15\nRoom 12: 9\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: None\nRoom 15: None\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 5:\nVisit room 8\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 50\nRoom 5: 10\nRoom 6: 0\nRoom 7: Infinity\nRoom 8: 50\nRoom 9: 10\nRoom 10: 50\nRoom 11: 60\nRoom 12: 50\nRoom 13: Infinity\nRoom 14: 50\nRoom 15: 0\nRoom 16: Infinity\n\nPrevious nodes:\nRoom 1: None\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 1\nRoom 4: 12\nRoom 5: 15\nRoom 6: 5\nRoom 7: None\nRoom 8: None\nRoom 9: 15\nRoom 10: 1\nRoom 11: 8\nRoom 12: 9\nRoom 13: None\nRoom 14: 4\nRoom 15: None\nRoom 16: None\n\nIteration 6:\nVisit room 10\nShortest distance: \nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 50\nRoom 3: 50\nRoom 4:"
