Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and you have been told that there is no connection between room 13  and 11 and also there is no connection between room 15 and room 9. From room 1,  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

Consider all the rooms connected to room 1: rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 2 has a reward of 5, room 3 has a reward of 0, room 4 has a reward of 0, and room 7 has a reward of 0. \n3. Add these rooms to a priority queue, sorted by reward in decreasing order: (2,5), (3,0), (4,0), (7,0).\n4. Pick the room with the highest reward from the priority queue: room 2. Visit room 2 and update the reward to 5.\n5. Consider all the rooms connected to room 2: rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 1 has already been visited, room 3 has a reward of 5, room 4 has a reward of 5, and room 16 has a reward of 0.\n6. Add these rooms to the priority queue, sorted by reward in decreasing order: (3,5), (4,5), (16,0).\n7. Pick the room with the highest reward from the priority queue: room 4. Visit room 4 and update the reward to 10.\n8. Consider all the rooms connected to room 4: rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 1 and room 2 have already been visited, room 3 has a reward of 10, and room 14 has a reward of 5.\n9. Add these rooms to the priority queue, sorted by reward in decreasing order: (3,10), (14,5).\n10. Pick the room with the highest reward from the priority queue: room 3. Visit room 3 and update the reward to 15.\n11. Consider all the rooms connected to room 3: rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 1 and room 2 have already been visited, room 4 has a reward of 15, and room 5 has a penalty of -15.\n12. Add these rooms to the priority queue, sorted by reward in decreasing order: (4,15), (5,-15).\n13. Pick the room with the highest reward from the priority queue: room 4. However, room 4 has already been visited, so skip it and pick the next room: room 5. Visit room 5 and update the reward to 0.\n14. Consider all the rooms connected to room 5: rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 3 has already been visited, room 6 has a reward of 0, room 7 has a reward of -15, and room 8 has a reward of -15.\n15. Add these rooms to the priority queue, sorted by reward in decreasing order: (6,0), (7,-15), (8,-15).\n16. Pick the room with the highest reward from the priority queue: room 6. Visit room 6 and update the reward to 0.\n17. Consider all the rooms connected to room 6: rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12.

Visit room 9 and update the reward to 0.\n23. Consider all the rooms connected to room 9: rooms 10, 11, 12, and 15.

Visit room 10 and update the reward to 10.\n26. Consider all the rooms connected to room 10: rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Calculate the rewards for these rooms: room 9 has already been visited, room 11 has a reward of 10, room 8 has a reward of 0, and room 12 has already been visited.\n27.
