Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can visit the neighboring rooms and update the shortest distance to reach each of them, considering the reward in each room. We can continue this process until we reach the target rooms (room 10 or room 15).\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 7, 8, 10.\n\nExplanation:\n- From room 1, we can go to room 7 which has a path length of 1 and no reward.\n- From room 7, we can go to room 8 which has a path length of 2 and no reward.\n- From room 8, we can go to room 10 which has a path length of 3 and a reward of 50.\n- We cannot reach room 15 with a shorter path, and the reward in room 10 is greater than the reward in room 15, so we choose to go to room 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 8, 10."
