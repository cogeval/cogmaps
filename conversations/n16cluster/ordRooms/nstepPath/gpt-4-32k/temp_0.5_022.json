Room 2 is not directly connected.\n- Room 11 connects to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 2 is not directly connected.\n- Room 8 connects to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 2 is not directly connected.\n- Room 12 connects to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 2 is not directly connected.\n\nStep 4: Since none of the connected rooms have a direct connection to room 2, we need to explore further:\n- From room 9: rooms 10, 11, 12, and 15 are connected. We have already checked room 10, so we will check rooms 11, 12, and 15.\n- From room 11: rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10 are connected. We have already checked rooms 9 and 10, so we will check rooms 13 and 12.\n- From room 8: rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10 are connected. We have already checked room 10, so we will check rooms 5, 6, and 7.\n- From room 12: rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6 are connected. We have already checked rooms 9, 10, and 11, so we will check room 6.\n\nStep 5: Check the newly explored rooms for a direct connection to room 2:\n- From room 11: Room 13 connects to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 2 is not directly connected. Room 12 has already been checked.\n- From room 8: Room 5 connects to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 2 is not directly connected. Room 6 and 7 will be checked later, as they are also connected to other rooms we are exploring.\n- From room 12: Room 6 connects to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 2 is not directly connected.\n\nStep 6: Continue exploring:\n- From room 13: rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11 are connected. We have already checked room 11, so we will check rooms 14, 15, and 16.\n- From room 5: Room 3 connects to rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5. Room 2 is directly connected.\n\nStep 7: We have found the shortest path from room 10 to room 2: 10 -> 8 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2.\n\nAnswer: 10, 8, 5, 3, 2"
