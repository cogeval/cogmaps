            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 9, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 3 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 3 and its neighbor is room 1, the tentative distance to room 1 is 1 (since they are directly connected) and we compare it to the current assigned value (which is infinity). Since 1 is smaller than infinity, we update the assigned value to 1.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest assigned distance, and set it as the new current room. If there is no such room, then we are done.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 9) has been visited. The assigned distance to room 9 is the shortest path from room 3 to room 9.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 3 to room 9: 3, 1, 7, 6, 12, 10, 9.\n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 7, 6, 12, 10, 9"
