Set the distance to room 14 as 0, and all other rooms as infinity.\n2. Mark room 14 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 14, calculate the distance from room 14 to that room and update its tentative distance if it is shorter than the current distance.\n4. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until room 8 is visited.\n6. Once room 8 is visited, the shortest path from room 14 to room 8 can be found by backtracking from room 8 to room 14 using the tentative distances.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 14 to room 8 is: 14, 4, 1, 7, 8.\n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 1, 7, 8"
