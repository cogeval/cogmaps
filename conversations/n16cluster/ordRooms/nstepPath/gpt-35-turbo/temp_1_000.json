Create a table with each room as a row and three columns: Visited (whether the room has been visited yet), Distance (the current shortest distance to that room from Room 15), and Previous Room (the previous room on the shortest path to that room from Room 15).\n2. Set the Distance of Room 15 to 0 and the Distance of all other rooms to infinity. Set Visited to False for all rooms.\n3. Loop through each room in the table:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the lowest Distance and mark it as visited.\n   b. For each neighboring room that is unvisited, calculate the tentative distance to that room (the Distance of the current room + the distance between the current room and the neighboring room). If the tentative distance is less than the current Distance for that neighboring room, update the Distance and Previous Room columns for that neighboring room.\n4. Once Room 7 is marked as visited, follow the Previous Room values backwards from Room 7 to Room 15 to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Room 15 to Room 7 is: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7."
