Create a table with three columns: \"Visited,\" \"Distance,\" and \"Path.\" Set the initial values for each row. For Room 15, set \"Visited\" to false, \"Distance\" to infinity (since we don't know the distance yet), and \"Path\" to an empty list. For all other rooms, set \"Visited\" to false, \"Distance\" to infinity, and \"Path\" to an empty list.\n\n2. For Room 15, set the \"Distance\" to 0 (since it is the starting point).\n\n3. While there are unvisited rooms, choose the unvisited room with the smallest \"Distance.\" In this case, that would be Room 15.\n\n4. For each of the neighboring rooms, calculate the distance from the starting room (in this case, Room 15) to that neighboring room. Add that distance to the \"Distance\" value for the starting room. If the resulting sum is smaller than the current \"Distance\" value for the neighboring room, update the neighboring room's \"Distance\" value and \"Path\" value to include the starting room.\n\n5. Mark the starting room as \"Visited.\"\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until Room 7 is marked as \"Visited.\"\n\n7. To find the shortest path, start at Room 7 and follow the \"Path\" values backwards until you reach Room 15.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from Room 15 to Room 7 is: \n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 11, 10, 8, 7"
