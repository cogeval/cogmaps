Assign all other rooms a tentative distance of infinity.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n3. Set the current room to room 6.\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighbor is the sum of the current room's tentative distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current room to the neighbor. For example, the weight of the edge between room 6 and room 7 is 1.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. If the destination room (room 14) has been visited, stop. The shortest path has been found.\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room. If all remaining unvisited rooms have a tentative distance of infinity, stop. There is no path to the destination.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the destination room is visited.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 6 to room 14 is: 6, 5, 3, 4, 14.\n\nAnswer: 6, 5, 3, 4, 14"
