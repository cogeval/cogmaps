Create a set of unvisited nodes and assign a tentative distance value to each node. For all nodes, except the starting node, the tentative distance value should be set to infinity. The starting node's tentative distance should be set to 0.\n\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n\n3. For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distance through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current distance value and update it if the new value is lower.\n\n4. Once we have considered all of the current node's neighbors, mark the current node as visited.\n\n5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination node has been visited or there are no more unvisited nodes.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 14 to room 6 is as follows:\n\n14, 4, 1, 7, 6\n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 1, 7, 6"
