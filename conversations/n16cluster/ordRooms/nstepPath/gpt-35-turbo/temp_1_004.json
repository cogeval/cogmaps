            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 11, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Here is the step by step process:\n\n1. Assign tentative distances to all rooms, with the distance to room 3 being 0 and the distance to all other rooms being infinity. Rooms that are directly connected to room 3 (rooms 1, 2, 4, and 5) will have their tentative distance set to the weight of the edge between them and room 3 (which is 1).\n\n2. Choose the room with the smallest tentative distance as the current room. In this case, it is room 1.\n\n3. For the current room, examine all of its neighbors (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7). Calculate their tentative distances by adding the weight of the edge between the current room and each neighbor to the current room's tentative distance. If a neighbor's tentative distance is less than its current distance, update its distance.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the list of unvisited rooms.\n\n5. If the destination room (room 11) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, repeat steps 2-4 with the unvisited room that has the smallest tentative distance.\n\n6. Once the destination room has been visited, the shortest path from room 3 to room 11 can be found by backtracking from room 11 to room 3, following the path of smallest distances.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine that the shortest path from room 3 to room 11 is 3, 9, 11. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 9, 11"
