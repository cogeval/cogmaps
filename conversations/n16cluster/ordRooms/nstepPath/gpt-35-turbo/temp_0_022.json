            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 10 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with the distance from room 10 to all other rooms. Initially, the distance to room 10 is 0 and the distance to all other rooms is infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | 0        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Mark room 10 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 10, update its distance to the sum of the distance to room 10 and the distance between room 10 and the adjacent room. For example, the distance to room 8 is 1 (the distance between room 10 and 8), so we update the table:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | 0        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 8) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. For each room adjacent to room 8 that is unvisited, update its distance to the sum of the distance to room 8 and the distance between room 8 and the adjacent room. For example, the distance to room 5 is 2 (the distance between room 8 and 5), so we update the table:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | 0        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n6. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance (in this case, room 6) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until room 2 is visited.\n\n8. The shortest path from room 10 to room 2 is the sequence of rooms visited in reverse order. In this case, the sequence is: 2, 16, 13, 11, 10. So the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 10, 11, 13, 16, 2"
