Create a table of distances from room 16 to each of the other rooms. Initially, the distance to all rooms except room 16 is infinity. The distance to room 16 is 0.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | 0        |\n\n2. Mark room 16 as visited.\n\n3. For each neighboring room of room 16 that is not already visited, calculate its tentative distance from room 16. This is the sum of the distance to room 16 and the distance from room 16 to the neighboring room. If this tentative distance is shorter than the current distance to the neighboring room, update the distance in the table.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | \u221e        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | \u221e        |\n| 6    | \u221e        |\n| 7    | \u221e        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | 0        |\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 16. In this case, it is room 2.\n\n5. Mark room 2 as visited.\n\n6.
