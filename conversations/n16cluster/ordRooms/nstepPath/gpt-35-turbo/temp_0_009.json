Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 0        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | 5        |\n| 10   | 4        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n22. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance from the table. In this case, it is room 9.\n\n23. Mark room 9 as visited.\n\n24. For each room connected to room 9, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 15 is connected to room 9 and has a distance of 1. Update the table as follows:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 1        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 1        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 0        |\n| 8    | 3        |\n| 9    | 5        |\n|"
