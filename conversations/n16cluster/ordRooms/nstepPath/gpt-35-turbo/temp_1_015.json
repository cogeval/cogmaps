Mark all other rooms as unvisited with a distance of infinity.\n2. The adjacent rooms to room 15 are rooms 13, 14, and 16. Calculate the distance to these rooms (distances are provided in the problem statement) and update their distance values if they are lower than their current distance values.\n3. The next closest room is room 14 with a distance of 1. Repeat step 2 for all adjacent rooms to room 14, except for room 15 which we have already visited. Update the distance values of these rooms if they are lower than their current distance values.\n4. The next closest room is room 4 with a distance of 2. Repeat step 2 for all adjacent rooms to room 4, except for rooms 15 and 14 which we have already visited. Update the distance values of these rooms if they are lower than their current distance values.\n5. The next closest room is room 1 with a distance of 3. Repeat step 2 for all adjacent rooms to room 1, except for rooms 15, 14, and 4 which we have already visited. Update the distance values of these rooms if they are lower than their current distance values.\n6. The next closest room is room 7 with a distance of 4. We have found the shortest path to room 7.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7."
