All other rooms are assigned a tentative distance of infinity.\n2. Visit each of Room 8's neighbors: Room 5, Room 6, Room 7, and Room 10.\n3. For each neighbor, calculate the distance from Room 8 to that neighbor and update its tentative distance if it is shorter than the current tentative distance.\n   - Room 5: tentative distance is now 1 (via Room 5)\n   - Room 6: tentative distance is now 1 (via Room 6)\n   - Room 7: tentative distance is now 1 (via Room 7)\n   - Room 10: tentative distance is now 1 (via Room 10)\n4. Mark Room 8 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. In this case, it is Room 5.\n5. Visit each of Room 5's neighbors: Room 3, Room 6, Room 7, and Room 8.\n6. For each neighbor, calculate the distance from Room 5 to that neighbor and update its tentative distance if it is shorter than the current tentative distance.\n   - Room 3: tentative distance is now 2 (via Room 8 and Room 5)\n   - Room 6: tentative distance is still 1 (via Room 6)\n   - Room 7: tentative distance is still 1 (via Room 7)\n   - Room 8: tentative distance is still 0 (via Room 8)\n7. Mark Room 5 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. In this case, it is Room 6.\n8. Visit each of Room 6's neighbors: Room 5, Room 7, Room 8, and Room 12.\n9. For each neighbor, calculate the distance from Room 6 to that neighbor and update its tentative distance if it is shorter than the current tentative distance.\n   - Room 5: tentative distance is still 1 (via Room 6)\n   - Room 7: tentative distance is now 2 (via Room 7 and Room 6)\n   - Room 8: tentative distance is still 0 (via Room 8)\n   - Room 12: tentative distance is now 2 (via Room 12 and Room 6)\n10.

For each neighbor, calculate the distance from Room 7 to that neighbor and update its tentative distance if it is shorter than the current tentative distance.\n   - Room 1: tentative distance is now 3 (via Room 1, Room 4, and Room 7)\n   - Room 5: tentative distance is still 1 (via Room 7 and Room 5)\n   - Room 6: tentative distance is now 2 (via Room 7 and Room 6)\n   - Room 8: tentative distance is still 0 (via Room 8)\n13.

Mark Room 10 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. In this case, it is either Room 9 or Room 11, both with a tentative distance of 2. We can choose either one.\n19. Visit each of the chosen room's neighbors. Since both Room 9 and Room 11 have already been visited, we don't need to update any tentative distances.\n20. Mark the chosen room (in this case, Room 9) as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. In this case, it is Room 12.\n21. Visit each of Room 12's neighbors: Room 6, Room 10, Room 11, and Room 9. However, all of them have already been visited, so we don't need to update any tentative distances.\n22. Mark Room 12 as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. In this case, it is Room 11.\n23. Visit each of Room 11's neighbors: Room 10, Room 12, Room 13, and Room 9.

Mark the chosen room (in this case, Room 14) as visited and select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance. However, all other rooms have already been visited, so we have found the shortest path.\nAnswer: 8, 5, 7, 1, 4, 14"
