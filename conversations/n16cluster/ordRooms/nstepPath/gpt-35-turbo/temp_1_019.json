Starting from room 15, we explore its neighboring rooms: room 13, room 14, room 16, and room 9. Among these, room 13 and room 9 are connected to additional rooms that we haven't explored yet, so we add them to the queue. \n\nNext, we explore room 13, which is connected to room 11, room 14, room 15, and room 16. We add room 11 to the queue since it hasn't been explored yet. We also explore room 9, which is connected to room 10, room 11, room 12, and room 15. We add room 10 and room 12 to the queue since they haven't been explored yet.\n\nIn the next round, we explore room 11 and room 10, both of which are connected to room 9, so we skip them. We also explore room 12 and room 14, adding room 6 to the queue. Finally, we explore room 16, which is connected to room 13 and room 2. Since room 2 hasn't been explored yet, we add it to the queue.\n\nIn the last round, we explore room 6 and room 2, but neither of them are connected to room 7, so we skip them. Finally, we explore room 5, which is connected to room 6, room 7, room 8, and room 3. Since room 7 is one of the neighboring rooms we were looking for, we have found the shortest path from room 15 to room 7.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is: 15, 9, 8, 5, 7\n\nAnswer: 15, 9, 8, 5, 7"
