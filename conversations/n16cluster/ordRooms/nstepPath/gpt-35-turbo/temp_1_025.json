            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 15 to room 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a list of unvisited rooms, initially containing all the rooms except the starting room (room 15). Create a dictionary of distances, initially setting the distance to the starting room as 0 and all other rooms as infinity. Create a dictionary of previous rooms, initially setting all previous rooms as None.\n\n2. While there are still unvisited rooms, select the room with the smallest distance from the starting room (room 15). For the first iteration, this will be room 15 itself.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to the selected room that is still unvisited, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the selected room and the distance between the selected room and the adjacent room. If this distance is smaller than the current distance to the adjacent room in the dictionary of distances, update the distance and the previous room in the dictionaries.\n\n4. Mark the selected room as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination room (room 7) is visited.\n\n6. Trace back the path from the destination room (room 7) to the starting room (room 15) using the previous rooms dictionary.\n\nThe shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 14, 4, 1, 7."
