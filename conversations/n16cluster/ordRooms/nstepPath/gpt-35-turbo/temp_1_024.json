For all rooms except room 9, we set the distance to infinity and the distance to room 9 itself is 0. \n\n2. We then examine all the rooms that are adjacent to room 9 (rooms 10, 11, 12, and 15). We update their distances to be 1 (since it takes only one step to reach them from room 9). \n\n3. We then examine the adjacent rooms to these rooms and update their distances if they can be reached with a shorter path through the rooms we have already visited. \n\n4. Continuing this process, we eventually find that the shortest path from room 9 to room 3 is: \n\n9, 12, 6, 5, 3 \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 9, 12, 6, 5, 3"
