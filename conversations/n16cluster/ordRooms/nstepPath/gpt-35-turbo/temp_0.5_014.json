            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 14. Initially, set the distance to infinity for all rooms except room 14, which has a distance of 0. Also, create a set of unvisited rooms containing all the rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 2    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 3    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 4    | 0        | false   |\n| 5    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 6    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 7    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | 0        | false   |\n| 15   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 16   | \u221e        | false   |\n\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest distance, which is room 4 (distance 0). Mark it as visited.\n\n3. For each of the unvisited rooms that are connected to room 4, calculate the distance from room 14 through room 4. If this distance is shorter than the current distance in the table, update the table with the new distance.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | 1        | false   |\n| 2    | 2        | false   |\n| 3    | 1        | false   |\n| 4    | 0        | true    |\n| 5    | 4        | false   |\n| 6    | 3        | false   |\n| 7    | 1        | false   |\n| 8    | 2        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | 3        | false   |\n| 11   | 4        | false   |\n| 12   | 4        | false   |\n| 13   | 1        | false   |\n| 14   | 0        | true    |\n| 15   | 2        | false   |\n| 16   | 1        | false   |\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all rooms have been visited or the destination room (room 6) has been visited.\n\n5. The shortest path from room 14 to room 6 is: 14, 4, 7, 6.\n\nAnswer: 14, 4, 7, 6."
