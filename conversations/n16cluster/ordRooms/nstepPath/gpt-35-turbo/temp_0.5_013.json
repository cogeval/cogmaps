            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 5 to room 15, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 5. For the rooms that are directly connected to room 5, we set their distance to 1, and for all other rooms, we set their distance to infinity. The table looks like this:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | \u221e        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | \u221e        |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | 1        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | 2        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | \u221e        |\n| 15   | \u221e        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n\n2. Choose the room with the smallest distance from the table. In this case, it is room 5.\n3. For each room that is directly connected to room 5 (rooms 3, 6, 7, and 8), update their distance in the table to 1.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until we reach room 15. The table will look like this:\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 2        |\n| 2    | 2        |\n| 3    | 1        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 0        |\n| 6    | 1        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | 1        |\n| 9    | 3        |\n| 10   | 2        |\n| 11   | 4        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 3        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 3        |\n| 16   | 3        |\n\n5. The shortest path from room 5 to room 15 is the path with the smallest total distance. We can follow the path backwards from room 15 to room 5 using the table. The path is: 5, 8, 10, 9, 15.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 5 to room 15 is: Answer: 5, 8, 10, 9, 15."
