            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 14. Set the distance of room 14 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   0\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 14 as visited.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to room 14, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 4 is adjacent to room 14 and has a distance of 1. Update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 4.\n\n5. Mark room 4 as visited.\n\n6. For each room adjacent to room 4, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 1 is adjacent to room 4 and has a distance of 2. Update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   2\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 1.\n\n8. Mark room 1 as visited.\n\n9. For each room adjacent to room 1, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 7 is adjacent to room 1 and has a distance of 2. Update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   2\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   inf\n  7  |   2\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n10. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n11. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n12. For each room adjacent to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 6 is adjacent to room 7 and has a distance of 2. Update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   2\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   1\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |   4\n  7  |   2\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   0\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n13. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 6.\n\n14. The shortest path from room 14 to room 6 is: 14, 7, 6. \n\nAnswer: 14, 7, 6."
