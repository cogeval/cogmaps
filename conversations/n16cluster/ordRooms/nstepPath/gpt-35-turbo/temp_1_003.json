Mark all rooms as unvisited and set the distance of each room to infinity, except for Room 15 which has a distance of 0.\n2. Set the current room to Room 15.\n3. For each of the rooms connected to the current room (Room 13, Room 14, Room 16, and Room 9), calculate the distance from Room 15 to that room through the current room. For example, the distance from Room 15 to Room 13 through Room 15 is 0 + 1 = 1. Update the \"Distance\" column of the corresponding row in the table if the new distance is shorter than the previous distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance as the new current room. In this case, it is Room 13.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the current room is Room 7.\n7. The shortest path from Room 15 to Room 7 is the sequence of rooms with the lowest cumulative distance. In this case, the shortest path is Room 15, Room 13, Room 11, Room 10, Room 8, Room 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 11, 10, 8, 7"
