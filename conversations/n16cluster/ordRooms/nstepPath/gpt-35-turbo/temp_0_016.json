            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 6 to room 16, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 6. Set the distance of room 6 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |    0\n  7  |   inf\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n2. Mark room 6 as visited.\n\n3. For each room connected to room 6, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 7 has a distance of 1 from room 6, so we update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |   inf\n  6  |    0\n  7  |    1\n  8  |   inf\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |   inf\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n4. Choose the room with the shortest distance from the table that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 7.\n\n5. Mark room 7 as visited.\n\n6. For each room connected to room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 has a distance of 2 from room 6 through room 7, so we update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |   inf\n  3  |   inf\n  4  |   inf\n  5  |    2\n  6  |    0\n  7  |    1\n  8  |    3\n  9  |   inf\n 10  |   inf\n 11  |   inf\n 12  |    4\n 13  |   inf\n 14  |   inf\n 15  |   inf\n 16  |   inf\n```\n\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance from the table that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 2.\n\n8. Mark room 2 as visited.\n\n9. For each room connected to room 2, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 16 has a distance of 5 from room 6 through rooms 7 and 2, so we update its distance in the table.\n```\nRoom | Distance\n--------------\n  1  |   inf\n  2  |    4\n  3  |    5\n  4  |    5\n  5  |    2\n  6  |    0\n  7  |    1\n  8  |    3\n  9  |    8\n 10  |    6\n 11  |    8\n 12  |    4\n 13  |    9\n 14  |    9\n 15  |    8\n 16  |    5\n```\n\n10. Choose the room with the shortest distance from the table that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 16.\n\n11. Mark room 16 as visited.\n\n12. We have reached our destination, so the shortest path from room 6 to room 16 is: 6, 7, 2, 16.\n\nAnswer: 6, 7, 2, 16"
