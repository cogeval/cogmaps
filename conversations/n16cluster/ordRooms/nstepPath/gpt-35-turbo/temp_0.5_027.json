Starting from room 15, we can calculate the shortest distance to each of its adjacent rooms (rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9). Then, we can repeat the process for the adjacent rooms until we reach room 7.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from room 15, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1, to room 14 is 1, to room 16 is 2, and to room 9 is 1.\n\n2. Among the adjacent rooms, room 13 and room 14 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 13.\n\n3. Starting from room 13, the shortest distance to room 11 is 1, to room 15 is 1, to room 16 is 1, and to room 14 is 1.\n\n4. Among the adjacent rooms, room 11, room 15, and room 16 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 15.\n\n5. Starting from room 15, the shortest distance to room 9 is 1, to room 13 is 1, to room 14 is 2, and to room 16 is 2.\n\n6. Among the adjacent rooms, room 9 and room 13 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 9.\n\n7. Starting from room 9, the shortest distance to room 10 is 1, to room 11 is 1, to room 12 is 1, and to room 15 is 1.\n\n8. Among the adjacent rooms, room 10 and room 11 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 11.\n\n9. Starting from room 11, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1, to room 9 is 1, to room 10 is 1, and to room 12 is 1.\n\n10. Among the adjacent rooms, room 13 and room 9 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 9.\n\n11. Starting from room 9, the shortest distance to room 10 is 1, to room 11 is 1, to room 12 is 1, and to room 15 is 1.\n\n12. Among the adjacent rooms, room 10 and room 11 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 10.\n\n13. Starting from room 10, the shortest distance to room 8 is 1, to room 9 is 1, to room 11 is 1, and to room 12 is 2.\n\n14. Among the adjacent rooms, room 8 and room 11 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 8.\n\n15. Starting from room 8, the shortest distance to room 5 is 1, to room 6 is 1, to room 7 is 1, and to room 10 is 1.\n\n16. Among the adjacent rooms, room 5, room 6, and room 7 have the shortest distance. So, we choose one of them and move to the next step. Let's choose room 7.\n\nSo, the shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is: 15, 9, 10, 8, 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 9, 10, 8, 7."
