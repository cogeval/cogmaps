Mark all rooms as unvisited and set their tentative distances to infinity, except for room 11 which has a distance of 0.\n2. Set the current room to 11.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 11 to that room (which is the distance from room 11 to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighboring room). If this tentative distance is less than the current tentative distance for that neighboring room, update its tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 3) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room. If no such room exists, stop (there is no path from room 11 to room 3).\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room has been visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 11 to room 3: 11, 12, 9, 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 11, 12, 9, 3."
