            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 15 to room 7, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: 0 for room 15 and infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as room 15 and the list of unvisited rooms as all rooms.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its adjacent rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the current room's distance and the distance between the current room and the adjacent room.\n4. If the tentative distance of an adjacent room is less than its current distance, update its distance value.\n5. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the unvisited list.\n6. If the destination room (room 7) has been visited, stop. The shortest path has been found.\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the current room. Go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is:\n\n15 -> 13 -> 11 -> 10 -> 8 -> 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 11, 10, 8, 7"
