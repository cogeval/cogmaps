Create a table with all the rooms and their distances. Set the distance of the starting room (room 11) to 0, and the distance of all the other rooms to infinity.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   | infinity |\n|  2   | infinity |\n|  3   | infinity |\n|  4   | infinity |\n|  5   | infinity |\n|  6   | infinity |\n|  7   | infinity |\n|  8   | infinity |\n|  9   | infinity |\n|  10  | infinity |\n|  11  |    0     |\n|  12  | infinity |\n|  13  | infinity |\n|  14  | infinity |\n|  15  | infinity |\n|  16  | infinity |\n\n2. Choose the room with the shortest distance as the current room. In this case, it is room 11.\n\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance to that neighbor as the distance to the current room plus the distance between the current room and the neighbor. If this distance is shorter than the distance currently in the table, update the table with the new shorter distance.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n|  1   |    3     |\n|  2   |    2     |\n|  3   |    2     |\n|  4   |    3     |\n|  5   |    3     |\n|  6   |    2     |\n|  7   |    1     |\n|  8   |    3     |\n|  9   |    2     |\n|  10  |    2     |\n|  11  |    0     |\n|  12  |    3     |\n|  13  |    2     |\n|  14  |    4     |\n|  15  |    3     |\n|  16  |    3     |\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the destination room (room 1) is visited.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 11 to room 1 is: 11, 7, 1.\n\nAnswer: 11, 7, 1."
