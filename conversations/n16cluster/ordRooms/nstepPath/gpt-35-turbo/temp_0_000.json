            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 11, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighbor is the sum of the distance from the current room to that neighbor and the tentative distance of the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 1 and its neighbor is room 2, the tentative distance to room 2 is 1 (the distance between room 1 and 2) plus the tentative distance of room 1 (which is 0), so the tentative distance to room 2 is 1. If the current assigned distance to room 2 is infinity, then the tentative distance becomes 1. If the current assigned distance to room 2 is already smaller than 1, then it remains the same.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the next current room. If there is no such room, then we are done.\n6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the destination room (room 11) has been visited. The assigned distance to room 11 is the shortest path from room 1 to room 11.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 1 to room 11: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 11.\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 11."
