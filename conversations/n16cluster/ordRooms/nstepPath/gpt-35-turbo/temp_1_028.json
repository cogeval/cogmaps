Choosing room 15 as it has the shortest distance (distance of 1).\n\nFrom room 15, we can move to room 13, 14, or 16. We will choose room 16 as it has the shortest distance (distance of 1).\n\nFrom room 16, we can move to room 2, 13, 14, or 7. We will choose room 7 as it has the shortest distance (distance of 1).\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 15 to room 7 is 15 -> 13 -> 15 -> 16 -> 7.\n\nAnswer: 15, 13, 15, 16, 7."
