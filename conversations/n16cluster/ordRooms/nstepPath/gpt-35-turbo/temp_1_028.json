Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\nStep 2: Starting from Room 15, visit the adjacent rooms (Rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9) and mark their distances as 1.\n\nStep 3: From the visited rooms, choose the one with the shortest distance. In this case, Room 9 has a distance of 1.\n\nStep 4: Visit the adjacent rooms of Room 9 (Rooms 10, 11, 12, and 15) and mark their distances as 2.\n\nStep 5: From the visited rooms, choose the one with the shortest distance. In this case, Room 5 has a distance of 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Room 15 to Room 5 is: 15, 9, 3, 5.\n\nAnswer: 15, 9, 3, 5"
