Create a table with all the rooms and their distances from room 15. Set the distance of room 15 to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n2. Mark room 15 as visited.\n3. For each neighboring room of room 15, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 9 is a neighbor of room 15 with a distance of 2. The current distance in the table for room 9 is also 2, so we don't need to update it.\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | inf      |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 10 with a distance of 1.\n5. Mark room 10 as visited.\n6. For each neighboring room of room 10, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 8 is a neighbor of room 10 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 8 is infinity, so we update it to 2 (1 + distance from room 10 to room 8).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n7.

For each neighboring room of room 13, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 14 is a neighbor of room 13 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 14 is 2, so we update it to 2 (1 + distance from room 13 to room 14).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | inf      |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | inf      |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n10.

For each neighboring room of room 7, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 1 is a neighbor of room 7 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 1 is infinity, so we update it to 4 (3 + distance from room 7 to room 1).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 4        |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | inf      |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | 3        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n13. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 8 with a distance of 2.\n14. Mark room 8 as visited.\n15. For each neighboring room of room 8, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 5 is a neighbor of room 8 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 5 is infinity, so we update it to 3 (2 + distance from room 8 to room 5).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 4        |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | 3        |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | 3        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n16. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 5 with a distance of 3.\n17. Mark room 5 as visited.\n18. For each neighboring room of room 5, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 7 is a neighbor of room 5 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 7 is 3, so we update it to 4 (3 + distance from room 5 to room 7).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 4        |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | 3        |\n| 6    | inf      |\n| 7    | 4        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14   | 2        |\n| 15   | 0        |\n| 16   | 2        |\n```\n19. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance in the table. In this case, it is room 12 with a distance of 2.\n20. Mark room 12 as visited.\n21. For each neighboring room of room 12, update its distance in the table if it is shorter than the current distance. For example, room 6 is a neighbor of room 12 with a distance of 1. The current distance in the table for room 6 is infinity, so we update it to 3 (2 + distance from room 12 to room 6).\n```\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | 4        |\n| 2    | inf      |\n| 3    | inf      |\n| 4    | inf      |\n| 5    | 3        |\n| 6    | 3        |\n| 7    | 4        |\n| 8    | 2        |\n| 9    | 2        |\n| 10   | 1        |\n| 11   | 3        |\n| 12   | 2        |\n| 13   | 1        |\n| 14"
