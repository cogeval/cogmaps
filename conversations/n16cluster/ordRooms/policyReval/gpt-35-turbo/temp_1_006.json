Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

Create a list of unvisited rooms and set their initial distance to infinity, except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. \n2. Set the reward of each room to 0, except for rooms 5, 10, and 16 which have rewards of -15, 10, and 0, respectively.\n3. For the current room, update the distance and reward of each neighboring room if the new distance is less than the current distance. \n4. Mark the current room as visited and repeat step 3 for the next unvisited room with the lowest distance. \n5. Once we reach room 16, backtrack to room 1 and record the rooms with the highest accumulated reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the path with the highest reward from room 1 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 16. \n\nThis path has a total reward of 0, which is the maximum possible reward given the new information that room 16 has a reward of 0."
