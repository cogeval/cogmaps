Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms. Then, we calculate the tentative distances to all neighboring rooms of room 1, taking into account the reward of the chest in each room. We repeat this process, selecting the neighboring room with the lowest tentative distance until we reach room 10 or 15, whichever has the higher reward.\n\nThe path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 8, 10.\n\nExplanation:\n- The tentative distances after the first step are: 2 for room 2, 1 for room 3, 1 for room 4, and 50 for room 7.\n- We select room 7 as the next room, with a tentative distance of 50.\n- The tentative distances from room 7 are: 2 for room 1, 2 for room 5, 2 for room 6, and 60 for room 8.\n- We select room 8 as the next room, with a tentative distance of 60.\n- The tentative distances from room 8 are: 3 for room 5, 3 for room 6, 4 for room 7, and 50 for room 10.\n- We select room 10 as the next room, with a tentative distance of 50 and a reward of 50.\n- There is no need to continue the algorithm since we already found a path that yields the most reward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
