Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

Create a table to keep track of the reward for each room and the previous room in the path. Initialize the reward for Room 1 to 0 and the rewards for all other rooms to -infinity (since we want to maximize reward).\n\n| Room | Reward | Previous Room |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| 1    | 0      | None          |\n| 2    | -inf   | None          |\n| 3    | -inf   | None          |\n| 4    | -inf   | None          |\n| 5    | -15    | None          |\n| 6    | -inf   | None          |\n| 7    | -inf   | None          |\n| 8    | -inf   | None          |\n| 9    | -inf   | None          |\n| 10   | 10     | None          |\n| 11   | -inf   | None          |\n| 12   | -inf   | None          |\n| 13   | -inf   | None          |\n| 14   | -inf   | None          |\n| 15   | -inf   | None          |\n| 16   | 0      | None          |\n\n2. Add Room 1 to a priority queue, with its reward as the priority.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Pop the room with the highest reward from the priority queue.\n   b. For each neighboring room:\n      i. Calculate the potential reward for the neighboring room (the reward of the current room plus the reward for visiting the neighboring room).\n      ii. If the potential reward is greater than the current reward for the neighboring room, update the table with the new reward and the current room as the previous room.\n      iii. If the neighboring room is not in the priority queue, add it with its reward as the priority.\n\n4. Once all reachable rooms have been processed, trace the path from Room 1 to Room 16 by following the previous room in the table.\n\nThe path that yields the most reward from Room 1 is: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16. \n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 13, 16"
