Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we will calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. Here is the result:\n\nShortest path with the most reward: 1, 7, 8, 10\n\nExplanation: From room 1, we can reach rooms 7 and 8 with a distance of 1 and a reward of 0. Then, from room 7, we can reach room 5 with a distance of 2 and a reward of 0, or room 8 with a distance of 2 and a reward of 0. Continuing from room 8, we can reach room 10 with a distance of 3 and a reward of 50. Finally, we cannot reach room 15 without passing through room 10, so we have to choose the reward from room 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"

From room 2, we can reach room 16 with a distance of 2 and a reward of 0, or room 3 with a distance of 1 and a reward of 0. However, going to room 3 does not lead to any chest with a higher reward than the one in room 13, so we choose to continue to room 16. From room 16, we can reach room 13 with a distance of 2 and a reward of 100. This is the highest reward we can get in the fewest number of steps.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 16, 13"
