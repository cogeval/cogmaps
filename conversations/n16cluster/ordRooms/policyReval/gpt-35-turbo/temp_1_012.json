Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will create a graph where each room is a node, and the edges between nodes represent the connections between rooms. The weight of each edge will represent the reward in the chest in the connected room.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms, and then choose the room with the highest reward that can be reached from room 1.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create the graph:\n   ```\n   {1: {2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 7: 0},\n    2: {1: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 16: 0},\n    3: {1: 0, 2: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0},\n    4: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 14: 0},\n    5: {6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 3: 0},\n    6: {5: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 12: 0},\n    7: {1: 0, 8: 0, 6: 0, 5: 0},\n    8: {5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 10: 0},\n    9: {10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 0, 15: 0},\n    10: {9: 0, 11: 0, 8: 0, 12: 0},\n    11: {13: 0, 9: 0, 12: 0, 10: 0},\n    12: {9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 6: 0},\n    13: {14: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0, 11: 0},\n    14: {4: 0, 13: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0},\n    15: {13: 0, 14: 0, 16: 0, 9: 0},\n    16: {13: 0, 14: 0, 15: 0, 2: 0}}\n   ```\n\n2. Set the initial distance from room 1 to all other rooms to infinity, except for room 1, which is set to 0.\n\n3. Set the initial \"previous\" room for all other rooms to None.\n\n4. Create an empty set of visited rooms.\n\n5. Create a priority queue and add room 1 with a priority of 0 (since it is the starting node).\n\n6. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Get the next room with the highest priority (lowest distance).\n   - If this room has not been visited yet:\n     - Mark it as visited.\n     - Update the distances to its neighbors (if it is shorter than the current distance).\n     - Set the \"previous\" room for its neighbors to this room.\n     - Add its neighbors to the priority queue with their updated priorities (distances).\n\n7. Once the priority queue is empty, we can retrieve the shortest path that yields the most reward. In this case, the highest reward is 50 in room 10 and 10 in room 15. Since we can only collect the reward once, we will choose the room with the highest reward that can be reached from room 1. The shortest path to room 10 is through rooms 1, 4, and 8, with a reward of 50. The shortest path to room 15 is through rooms 1, 3, 5, and 9, with a reward of 10. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,4,8"

We will need to modify the weights of the edges in the graph to reflect this new information and run Dijkstra's algorithm again to find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Modify the graph by setting the weight of the edge between room 1 and room 13 to 100.\n\n2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm as before to find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms.\n\n3.
