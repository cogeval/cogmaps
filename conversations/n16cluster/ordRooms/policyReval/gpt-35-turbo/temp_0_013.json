Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.
