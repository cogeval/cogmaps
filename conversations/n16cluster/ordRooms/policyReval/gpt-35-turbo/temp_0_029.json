Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to all other rooms while keeping track of the total reward or penalty. We can stop the algorithm once we reach room 16, since there is no reward for visiting it anymore. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 10 is 1-8-10, with a total reward of 5 (from room 8) + 10 = 15. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 16 is 1-2-16, with a total reward of 5 (from room 2) + 0 = 5. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 5 is 1-7-5, with a total reward of -15 (penalty from room 5). \n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward is 1-8-10, with a total reward of 15. \n\nAnswer: 1,8,10"
