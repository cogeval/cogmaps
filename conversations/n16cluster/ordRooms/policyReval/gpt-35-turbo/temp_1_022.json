Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\n1. First, we need to create a table to keep track of the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms. We initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which we initialize to 0. We also create a table to keep track of the rooms that have been visited.\n\n2. We start from room 1 and visit all its neighboring rooms. We update the distance table with the distances from room 1 to its neighboring rooms. In this case, we update the distance to room 2, 3, 4, and 7 as 1, since they are directly connected to room 1.\n\n3. We then select the room with the shortest distance from the distance table that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, we select room 2 since it has a distance of 1. We then visit all its neighboring rooms (except the ones that have already been visited) and update the distance table with their distances from room 1, which is the sum of the distance from room 1 to room 2 and the distance from room 2 to the neighboring room. We also update the table of visited rooms.\n\n4. We repeat step 3 until we visit all rooms or until we reach room 10 or 15, which are the rooms with rewards.\n\n5. Once we reach either room 10 or 15, we check which room has a chest with a higher reward and take that path. We then backtrack from that room to room 1 to find the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 2, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 10"
