Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15 and there is a chest with a reward of 0 in room 13. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

You can use \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d to give partial answers.\nThere is no way to get 100 from only 1 room, so we know that answer is false. Let's focus on a path from 1 to 50. 1 goes to 7,5 (giving 140) 7 goes to 15,10 (giving 210) 5 goes to 6,8(giving 150) 8 goes to 9,12(giving 110) 12(the chest with 10) goes to 6,8(giving 80) 6 goes to 8,9(giving 100) We have just found our path that gives us 100! Congratulations!\nCan you solve a harder version? There are 21 rooms and you do not know the reward of any of them. You find out that from room 1, a path with a sum of reward as 50 yields a total reward of 51, what is the minimum number of rooms in that path?"
