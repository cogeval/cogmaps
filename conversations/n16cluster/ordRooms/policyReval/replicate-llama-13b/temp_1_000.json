Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 0 for visiting room 16. From room 1  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

We initialize a priority queue with node 1 and a distance of 0.\n\nAt each step, we extract the node with minimum distance from the priority queue and update its neighbors' distances if they are smaller than previously computed distances. At each iteration, we also check if visiting a neighbor would result in obtaining a larger total reward than what was obtained before.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we obtain that visiting rooms 1-2-16 has a total rewardreward for node 16), while visiting rooms 1-7-6-12-11-13 has a total reward of 10 (reward for node 10) which is greater than any other path. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1,7,6,12,11,13"
