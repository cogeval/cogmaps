Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We can collect the reward from the room 10 or 15.\n\nIf we go to the room 10, then we can collect 50. If we go to the room 15, then we can collect 10. If we go to the room 0, then we cannot collect any reward.\n\nNow, we have to choose the best path that gives the most reward. The best path is to go to the room 10 and collect 50.\n\nThe output is a comma-separated list of rooms. For example, if the best path is to go to the room 10 and collect 50, the output is 10, 5, 50.\n\nSo, I'll use the J library to implement this. You can use any other language. It's very simple.
