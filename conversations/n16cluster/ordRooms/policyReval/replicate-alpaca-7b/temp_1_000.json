Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

This route has the most reward of 5 (found in room 10) followed by 4 (room 16), followed by 3 (room 4) and it ends in room 2 (room connected to room 1) where the search is stopped due to the \u201conce from one chest\u201d restrictions. However any other option leads to less yield than 5 and eventually the search should reach a room that is not rewarded. Thus the final answer for the task is Answer: (3,7,0,11), showing that the closest rooms that yield rewards found outside of the starting room are 13 and 9 since either one skipping the starting node of 1 cannot be completed due to rewards already being received from connecting to room 11 via connecting to either 5 (room 11) or 4 (room 4). Thus the result of this AI assistance would be to travel from room 1 through connecting to 3, 4, 16,8 and finally1 15 and receive two separate rewards totaling 50 which fulfills the task goal stated at the beginning.
