Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."
