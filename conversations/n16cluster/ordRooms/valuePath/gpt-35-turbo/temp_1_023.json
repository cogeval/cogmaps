Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Set all unvisited rooms to have tentative rewards of 0.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room:\n   a. Calculate the reward for visiting that room.\n   b. If the tentative reward for the neighboring room is less than the reward for visiting that room plus the tentative reward for the current room, update the tentative reward for the neighboring room to be that value.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 10 or room 16) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the largest tentative reward, set it as the current room, and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the path from room 1 to room 10 with the most reward is: 1, 7, 8, 10, with a total reward of 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
