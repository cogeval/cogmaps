Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Initialize the distance of all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which is 0. Set all rooms as unvisited.\n2. Set the tentative distance of room 2, 3, 4, and 7 as 1 (since they are directly connected to room 1). Mark these rooms as visited.\n3. Among the visited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance. This is room 2.\n4. For each room connected to room 2 (rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16), calculate the tentative distance as the sum of the distance to room 2 (1) plus the reward of the chest in that room (0 for all except room 10 which has a reward of 50). Update the distance of each room if the tentative distance is smaller.\n5. Mark room 2 as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until we reach room 10 or 15 (since they have the rewards).\n7. The shortest path that yields the most reward is the path that ends in either room 10 or 15 with the highest reward. In this case, the path is: 1, 7, 8, 10 (with a reward of 50).\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
