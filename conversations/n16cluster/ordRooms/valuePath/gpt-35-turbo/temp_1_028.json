Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we assign a tentative distance of infinity to each room except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. Then we visit the neighbors of room 1 and update their tentative distances based on the rewards in the chests. We repeat this process, visiting the next closest room until we reach either room 10 or 15. \n\nThe distances and rewards for each room are:\n\nRoom 1: Distance 0, no reward\nRoom 2: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 3: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 4: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 5: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 6: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 7: Distance 1, no reward\nRoom 8: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 9: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 10: Distance 2, reward 50\nRoom 11: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 12: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 13: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 14: Distance infinity, no reward\nRoom 15: Distance 3, reward 10\nRoom 16: Distance infinity, no reward\n\nBased on these distances and rewards, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 7, 8, 10\n\nSo the answer is: Answer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
