Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to rooms 10 and 15 and then check which one has the highest reward. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set room 1 as the current room.\n3. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate its tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge connecting them.\n4. If a neighbor's tentative distance is less than its current distance, update its distance and set the current room as its previous room.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. If room 10 and 15 have been visited, compare their rewards and choose the one with the highest reward.\n7. If there are unvisited rooms, set the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the new current room and repeat from step 3.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 (reward of 50). The total distance of this path is 3. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
