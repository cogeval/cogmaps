Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the path from room 1 that yields the most reward, we need to calculate the rewards for each possible path from room 1 to room 16 or 10, while avoiding room 5. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, we create a graph with the connections between rooms and the rewards/penalties for each room:\n\n```\ngraph = {\n    1: {2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 7: 0},\n    2: {1: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 16: 5},\n    3: {1: 0, 2: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0},\n    4: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 14: 0},\n    5: {6: -15, 7: 0, 8: 0, 3: 0},\n    6: {5: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 12: 0},\n    7: {1: 0, 6: 0, 8: 0, 5: 0},\n    8: {5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 10: 0},\n    9: {10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 0, 15: 0},\n    10: {9: 0, 11: 0, 8: 10, 12: 0},\n    11: {13: 0, 9: 0, 12: 0, 10: 0},\n    12: {9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 6: 0},\n    13: {14: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0, 11: 0},\n    14: {4: 0, 13: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0},\n    15: {13: 0, 14: 0, 16: 0, 9: 0},\n    16: {13: 0, 14: 0, 15: 0, 2: 5}\n}\n```\n\nNext, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from room 1 to rooms 10 and 16, while avoiding room 5:\n\n```\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, avoid):\n    heap = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    while heap:\n        (cost, node, path) = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if node == avoid:\n            continue\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            path = path + [node]\n            if node in graph:\n                for next_node, edge_cost in graph[node].items():\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + edge_cost, next_node, path))\n            if node == 10 or node == 16:\n                return path, cost\n    return [], 0\n\npath_to_10, reward_10 = dijkstra(graph, 1, 5)\npath_to_16, reward_16 = dijkstra(graph, 1, 5)\n```\n\nFinally, we compare the rewards of the two paths and return the one with the higher reward:\n\n```\nif reward_10 >= reward_16:\n    answer = ','.join(str(room) for room in path_to_10)\nelse:\n    answer = ','.join(str(room) for room in path_to_16)\n\nAnswer: 1,4,14,13,11,10"
