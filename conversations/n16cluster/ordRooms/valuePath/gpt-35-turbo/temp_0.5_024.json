Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of zero to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to that adjacent room by adding the reward of the chest in that room to the current room's tentative distance. If this tentative distance is less than the adjacent room's current distance, update the adjacent room's distance to this tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. From the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest current distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms, stop.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (either room 10 or room 15) is visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, which is the reward of the chest in room 10. The path from room 1 to room 15 is longer and has a total reward of 10, which is the reward of the chest in room 15. Therefore, the optimal path is to go to room 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"
