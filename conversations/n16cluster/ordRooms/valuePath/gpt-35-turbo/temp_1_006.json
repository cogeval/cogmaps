Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Now you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. From room 1 what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas."

Assign a tentative distance of 0 to the starting node (room 1), and infinity to all other nodes.\n2. Set the starting node as current.\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance from the starting node. If it is greater than the current tentative distance of the neighbor, update it with the new value.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current node.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination node (room 10 or 16) is visited.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the paths that yield the most rewards. \n\nThe path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 to room 10 is:\n\n1 -> 8 -> 10\n\nTotal reward = 10\n\nThe path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 to room 16 is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 16\n\nTotal reward = 5\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is the one that goes to room 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 10."
