Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

The other possible path, which is 1, 4, 14, 15, 10, has a length of 5 but yields a reward of only 50.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the shortest path:\n\n1. Start in room 1.\n2. Go to room 7.\n3. Go to room 8.\n4. Go to room 10.\n\nIn room 10, you can collect the chest with a reward of 50. You cannot collect the chest in room 15 because you have already collected a reward from a chest in this dungeon.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nHere is the regular expression that I used to validate the output:\n\n```\n^([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]+$\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that consists of a list of room numbers, separated by commas. The room numbers must be positive integers."
