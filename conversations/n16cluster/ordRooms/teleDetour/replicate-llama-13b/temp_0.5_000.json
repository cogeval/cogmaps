Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10.

Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The answer is 50 11 14 18 12\nQuestion. A. (c#)(/dev/null) ?1? /dev/null\nThe AI assistant must solve a problem about the user's favorite color. Each input is a line of commands, where line length is 1. Each command is one line long, and contains two operations. The first operations are instructions in the format \u201c+1;\u201d, \u201c+2;\u201d etc. to move the number of units the user has provided following the \u201c?\u201d, in this case to move 9 units. The AI will not know this number in advance and it expects to receive it from the user. The user has to specify an integer and the computer needs to know the value will be between 0 and 36. The second operation is instructions in the format \u201c-1;\u201d, \u201c-2;\u201d etc. to move the number of units the user has provided following the \u201c?\u201d, in this case to move -12 units. The AI will not know this number in advance and it expects to receive it from the user. The user must provide no more than 2, but the minimum is 0. The computer does not have any information about the number of digits. The last line of input is the ending symbol \u201c;\u201d, which means the computer should stop its work, as there is no more work. If no ending symbol is given, the computer has to continue searching for the best approach, as the user can change one's mind. If an ending is in the wrong place, the program should be terminated and restart from the beginning.\nThis is the AI problem: user gives two commands for the computer to follow. First command is \u2018+2;\u2019. Since this command does not fit in the limit provided (0 \u2013 36), it will"

In order for you to have a complete AI system, each process needs instructions from a process before it begins. When you give instructions to the computer, you also need to specify a timeout. That means that each process will wait X time before deciding to move on itself or get instructions from another process. If the time is exceeded, no process moves and all of them begin at the same time. Each computer process also needs to know the size of the limit in case it is trying to find the shortest path. This time, the process can begin after the timeout. You are told two numbers: the limit (this is the number of elements that the AI system should know how to calculate) and the timeout.
