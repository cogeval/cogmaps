Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

First, we assign a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1 which has a distance of 0. We also keep track of the previous room that leads to each room. Then, we explore the adjacent rooms of room 1 and update their tentative distances and previous rooms accordingly. We continue exploring the adjacent rooms with the smallest tentative distance until we reach either room 10 or room 15. At this point, we return the path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward. \n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 7, 8, 10 \n\nThe reward obtained is 50 which is from the chest in room 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10"

Therefore, we need to find an alternative path from room 1 to the other rooms. \n\nOne option is to take the path from room 1 to room 5, use the teleportation portal to teleport to one of the neighboring rooms of room 12, and then take the path to either room 10 or room 15. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 to room 5 is: \n\n1, 4, 3, 5 \n\nThe shortest path from room 5 to room 10 or room 15 can be found using the following tentative distances: \n\n- Room 8: 5 (reward: 0)\n- Room 6: 6 (reward: 0)\n- Room 12: 7 (reward: 0)\n- Room 9: 8 (reward: 0)\n- Room 11: 9 (reward: 0)\n- Room 16: 10 (reward: 0)\n- Room 13: 11 (reward: 10)\n- Room 14: 12 (reward: 0)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 4, 3, 5, 13 \n\nThe reward obtained is 10 which is from the chest in room 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 3, 5, 13"
