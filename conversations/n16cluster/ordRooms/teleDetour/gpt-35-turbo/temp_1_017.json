Using the information provided, we get the following table:\n\n| Room | Connected To | Reward |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| 1    | 2, 3, 4, 7  | 0      |\n| 2    | 1, 3, 4, 16 | 0      |\n| 3    | 1, 2, 4, 5  | 0      |\n| 4    | 1, 2, 3, 14 | 0      |\n| 5    | 6, 7, 8, 3  | 0      |\n| 6    | 5, 7, 8, 12 | 0      |\n| 7    | 1, 8, 6, 5  | 0      |\n| 8    | 5, 6, 7, 10 | 0      |\n| 9    | 10, 11, 12, 15 | 0      |\n| 10   | 9, 11, 8, 12   | 50     |\n| 11   | 13, 9, 12, 10  | 0      |\n| 12   | 9, 10, 11, 6   | 0      |\n| 13   | 14, 15, 16, 11 | 0      |\n| 14   | 4, 13, 15, 16  | 0      |\n| 15   | 13, 14, 16, 9  | 10     |\n| 16   | 13, 14, 15, 2  | 0      |\n\nNext, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1 and calculate the shortest path to each room while keeping track of the maximum reward. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Mark the distance from room 1 to itself as 0, and all other distances as infinity.\n\n2. Set the maximum reward for room 1 as 0.\n\n3. Visit each connected room of room 1 (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7) and update their distance to 1 and their maximum reward to 0 since they don't have a chest.\n\n4. Select the room with the lowest distance (room 2) and visit its connected rooms (rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16). Update their distances and maximum rewards accordingly.\n\n5. Continue visiting the connected rooms with the lowest distance and updating their distances and maximum rewards until we reach room 10 or 15. \n\n6. Since the reward for room 10 is greater than the reward for room 15, we choose room 10 as the chest to collect and the shortest path that yields the most reward is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 8, 10.
