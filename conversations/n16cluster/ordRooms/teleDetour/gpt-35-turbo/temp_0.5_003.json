Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nStarting from room 1, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7. Among these, room 2 has a chest with a reward of 50, so we will add it to our priority queue with a distance of 50. We can also add rooms 3, 4, and 7 to the queue with a distance of 0, since they do not have any chests.\n\nNext, we will explore the neighbors of room 2. We can reach rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16 from here. Room 16 has a chest with a reward of 10, so we will add it to the queue with a distance of 60 (50 from room 2 + 10 from room 16). We can also add rooms 1, 3, and 4 to the queue with a distance of 50, since they do not have any chests.\n\nNow, we will explore the neighbors of room 16. We can reach rooms 2, 13, 14, and 15 from here. Room 15 has a chest with a reward of 10, so we will add it to the queue with a distance of 70 (60 from room 16 + 10 from room 15). We can also add rooms 2, 13, and 14 to the queue with a distance of 60, since they do not have any chests.\n\nFinally, we will explore the neighbors of room 15. We can reach rooms 13, 14, 9, and 16 from here. However, since we have already collected a chest with a reward of 10, we will not consider room 15 anymore. We can add rooms 13, 14, and 9 to the queue with a distance of 70, since they do not have any chests.\n\nAt this point, our priority queue looks like this: \n\n(70, 13), (70, 14), (70, 9), (60, 2), (60, 3), (60, 4), (50, 1), (50, 3), (50, 4), (50, 7)\n\nWe will now extract the room with the highest reward from the queue, which is room 13. We can reach room 13 from room 16 with a distance of 10, so the total distance from room 1 to room 13 is 70 + 10 = 80.\n\nNext, we will extract room 14 from the queue. We can reach room 14 from room 4 with a distance of 10, so the total distance from room 1 to room 14 is 60 + 10 = 70.\n\nFinally, we will extract room 9 from the queue. We can reach room 9 from room 10 with a distance of 0, so the total distance from room 1 to room 9 is 70 + 0 = 70.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 4, 14, 13. \n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 13"

However, we need to take into account the teleportation portal in room 5.

Room 16 has a chest with a reward of 10, so we will add it to the queue with a distance of 60 (50 from room 2 + 10 from room 16).

We can reach room 14 from room 4 with a distance of 10, so the total distance from room 1 to room 14 is 50 + 10 = 60.\n\nNow, we need to consider the teleportation portal in room 5. From room 5, we can go to any neighboring room of room 12. The neighboring rooms of room 12 are rooms 6, 10, 11, and 9. We can add these rooms to our queue from room 5 with a distance of 0, since they do not have any chests.\n\nAt this point, our priority queue looks like this: \n\n(70, 13), (70, 14), (70, 9), (60, 2), (60, 3), (60, 4), (50, 1), (50, 3), (50, 4), (50, 5), (50, 6), (50, 9), (50, 10), (50, 11)\n\nWe will now extract the room with the highest reward from the queue, which is room 13. We can reach room 13 from room 16 with a distance of 10, so the total distance from room 1 to room 13 is 60 + 10 = 70.\n\nNext, we will extract room 14 from the queue. We can reach room 14 from room 4 with a distance of 10, so the total distance from room 1 to room 14 is 50 + 10 = 60.\n\nFinally, we will extract room 9 from the queue.
