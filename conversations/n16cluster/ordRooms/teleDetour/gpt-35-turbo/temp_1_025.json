Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will have to find an alternative path. \n\nAs the teleportation portal appears in room 5 and it allows us to go to any neighboring room of room 12, we can use this to our advantage. Room 12 is connected to room 10, which has a chest with a reward of 50. Therefore, if we can get to room 12 from room 5, we can then go to room 10 and collect the reward.\n\nSo, the shortest path that yields the most reward is as follows:\n\n1-3-5-6-12-10 (total reward: 0+0+0+0+0+50 = 50)\n\nNote that we did not need to go to room 15 as its reward is lower than the reward in room 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward with the given conditions is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 10"
