Create a table with columns \"Room\", \"Distance\", \"Visited\", and \"Previous\". Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and all other distances to infinity. Set \"Visited\" and \"Previous\" to null for all rooms.\n\n2. From room 1, calculate the distance to all connected rooms (rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7). Update the table with the new distances and set \"Previous\" to 1 for each room.\n\n3. Mark room 1 as \"Visited\" and select the room with the shortest distance that has not been visited (in this case, room 2 with a distance of 1).\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the newly selected room (room 2), updating the distances and previous rooms for all connected rooms (rooms 1, 3, 4, and 16).\n\n5. Continue this process until you have visited all rooms or until the target room (room 10 or 15) has been visited.\n\n6.
