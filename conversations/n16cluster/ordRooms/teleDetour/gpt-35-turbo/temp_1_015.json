Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only  once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room  13 and 11 and also there is no connection between room 15 and room 9. From room 1,  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 16 while keeping track of the rewards and penalties along the way. However, since we are interested in the path that yields the most reward, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to prioritize visiting rooms with higher rewards and avoid rooms with penalties.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can keep track of the total reward or penalty accumulated so far and the path taken to reach each room. We initialize the total reward of room 1 as 0 and the rewards and penalties for each room as follows:\n\n- Room 2: reward of 0\n- Room 3: reward of 0\n- Room 4: reward of 0\n- Room 5: penalty of -15\n- Room 6: reward of 0\n- Room 7: reward of 0\n- Room 8: reward of 0\n- Room 9: reward of 0\n- Room 10: reward of 10\n- Room 11: reward of 0\n- Room 12: reward of 0\n- Room 13: reward of 0\n- Room 14: reward of 0\n- Room 15: reward of 0\n- Room 16: reward of 5\n\nWe can use a priority queue to keep track of the rooms to visit next, ordered by the highest total reward so far. We can add room 1 to the priority queue and start the algorithm.\n\n1. Pop the first room from the priority queue. This will be room 1 with a total reward of 0 and no path taken yet.\n2. Check if the popped room is room 16. If it is, we have found the optimal path and can stop the algorithm. Otherwise, continue with the next steps.\n3. For each neighbor of the popped room, calculate the potential total reward if we were to visit the neighbor, taking into account the reward or penalty of the neighbor and the total reward accumulated so far. If the neighbor has already been visited, ignore it. Otherwise, add the neighbor to the priority queue with the updated total reward and path taken.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the priority queue is empty or we have visited room 16.\n\nHere is the optimal path:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 16\n\nThe total reward for this path is 5."
