Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to  rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is  connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10.  Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11,  8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also  connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and  11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13,  14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. Initially, you have been told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting room 16, and a reward of 10 for visiting room 10. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting room 5. You are in room 1 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only  once. At the same time, you have been told that there is no connection between room  13 and 11 and also there is no connection between room 15 and room 9. From room 1,  what is the path that yields the most reward? Please list the room numbers in  order, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the path that yields the most reward, we can use the concept of Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from room 1, we can explore all the possible paths by visiting each connected room only once and keeping track of the rewards and penalties. We can use a stack to keep track of the current path and a list to keep track of the visited rooms. We can stop exploring a path if we reach a dead end or a visited room. Once all the paths have been explored, we can choose the one with the highest reward.\n\nFollowing this approach, we can find that the path that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 2, 16, 13, 14, 4, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 20 (5 for room 16 and 15 for room 10) and a total penalty of 15 for room 5. Note that we cannot visit room 9 from room 15 as there is no connection between them. Also, we cannot visit room 11 from room 13 as there is no connection between them.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 16, 13, 14, 4, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10"
