Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Repeat the following until all rooms are visited:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance.\n   b. For each room connected to the chosen room, update its distance to the maximum reward between its current distance and the reward in that room.\n   c. Mark the chosen room as visited.\n5. Trace back the path from room 10 or room 15 to room 1, choosing the adjacent room with the maximum reward at each step.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, collected from room 10. Note that the path 1 -> 5 -> 8 -> 10 also has a reward of 50, but it is longer than the previous path. Therefore, the first path is the shortest. Answer: 1, 8, 10"
