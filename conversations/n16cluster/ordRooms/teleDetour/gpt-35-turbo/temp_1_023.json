Room 4 is also connected to rooms 1, 2, 3, and 14. Room 5 is connected to rooms 6, 7, 8, and 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 5, 7, 8, and 12. Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 8, 6, and 5. Room 8 is also connected to rooms 5, 6, 7, and 10. Room 9 is connected to rooms 10, 11,12, and 15. Room 10 is connected to rooms 9, 11, 8, and 12. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13, 9, 12, and 10. Room 12 is also connected to rooms 9, 10, 11, and 6. Room 13 is connected to rooms 14, 15, 16, and 11. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 13, 15, 16. Room 15 is connected to rooms 13, 14, 16, and 9. Room 16 is also connected to rooms 13, 14, 15, and 2. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 10 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 15. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 4, and 7 with no reward. Room 7 is connected to rooms 5 and 8, and room 5 is connected to rooms 6 and 8, both with no reward. Room 8 is connected to rooms 10 and 5, but since we can only collect one reward, we will not go to room 10. \n\nRoom 7 is also connected to room 6, which is connected to room 12, which is connected to room 9, which is connected to room 15 with a reward of 10. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 6, 12, 9, 15.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 6, 12, 9, 15"

From room 5, we can teleport to any neighboring room of room 12.\n\nWe can first go to room 6 from room 5, which is connected to room 12, which is connected to room 9, which is connected to room 15 with a reward of 10. Alternatively, we can directly go to room 10 from room 5, which has a reward of 50.\n\nTherefore, the two possible paths that yield a reward are:\n\n1. 1, 5, 6, 12, 9, 15 (total reward = 10)\n2. 1, 5, 10 (total reward = 50)\n\nThe second path yields the highest reward, so the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 5, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 10"
