The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

However, we are not interested in the sunflower field as it does not offer any free flowers. \n\nThe tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field. We can obtain a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if we visit the chrysanthemum field, so we will prioritize visiting the chrysanthemum field. \n\nThe daisy field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. However, the chrysanthemum field offers more flowers than the daisy field, so we will skip the daisy field. \n\nThe lily field is connected to the rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. Since the chrysanthemum field offers more flowers than the lily field, we will skip the lily field as well. \n\nThe peony field is connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. However, we have already prioritized visiting the chrysanthemum field, so we will skip the peony field. \n\nThe orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. We have already visited the chrysanthemum field, so we will skip the orchid field. \n\nThe hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. We have already visited the chrysanthemum field, so we will skip the hydrangea field. \n\nThe marigold field is connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. We have already visited the chrysanthemum field, so we will skip the marigold field. \n\nThe daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. We can obtain a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if we visit the lavender field, so we will prioritize visiting the lavender field. \n\nThe lavender field is connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. Since we have already prioritized visiting the chrysanthemum field and obtained the maximum number of flowers, we will skip the lavender field. \n\nThe aster field is connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. We have already skipped the lavender field, so we will skip the aster field as well. \n\nThe zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. Since we have already skipped the daisy field and lavender field, we will skip the zinnia field as well. \n\nThe poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. We have already skipped the lavender field and aster field, so we will skip the poppy field as well. \n\nThe carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. We have already visited the chrysanthemum field, so we will skip the carnation field. \n\nFinally, we have reached the chrysanthemum field, which offers a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: \n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Chrysanthemum"

Therefore, we need to find an alternative route.\n\nFrom the rose field, we can still visit the sunflower field, tulip field, and daisy field. However, none of these fields offer any free flowers.\n\nNow, considering the teleportation portal in the orchid field, we can immediately go to any field from there.\n\nFrom the orchid field, we can directly teleport to the hydrangea field, which is connected to the lily field. This allows us to bypass the blocked path from the rose field to the lily field.\n\nThe lily field is connected to the rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. Since we are already in the hydrangea field, we can obtain a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if we visit the lavender field.\n\nTherefore, the updated shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, considering the teleportation portal, is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily"
