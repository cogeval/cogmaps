The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

A farmer has 2368000 units to use in the farm, of which 13000 units are used to build fences. Fences around individual planting sites can only have three different widths, and at least one side of a single-piece fence needs to have at least two pieces. Furthermore, there must be at least one fence around each planting site. For example, the following diagram illustrates the use of 140 units to build fences: (a) A single piece can hold up to 100 units, and a single planting site can cover at most 4*4*4 cells. Now you are given an input file with the following information: The first line of each file contains the number of flower fields (1\u201315); each line after that describes a row in the field matrix. The cells are numbered from 0 to 255. Each cell can be equal to either a number or an uppercase letter. Each flower field has a single row for each side of its border, and 16 rows in total. Each line specifies a series of flower fields (with two exceptions, the border fields), where the end of each series is defined by an uppercase B (1st exception) or a lowercase b (2nd exception). The second line contains two numbers, the number of pieces in the final fence and the area of the field itself. The third line contain the number of rows required to create these pieces at the specified border. The fourth line contains the coordinates of the start of each fence, each separated by a space. The fifth line contains the coordinates of the end of each piece in the fence, each separated by a space. The sixth line contains additional coordinates, each separated by a space; the coordinates of a flower field begin with a number (0 for the first site in the flower field, and a negative digit otherwise).
