The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Please help me to write some regexes that would check if the number of words in the question before the action exceeds the number of words in the answer. The first word before the action should be a verb, which is the answer for the \"before\" action. The answer must be a noun. The verb can indicate the before action. When the word before is longer than the answer, the answer is wrong.\nAnswer: ^(.*, before|before:)* answer:[^A-FJZ-]+\nuser: The name of the school is \"The School of Cool\", it just turned 90 years old, and it is the #1 school when it comes to cool points. (Cool points is a school-ranking system developed in this question. It is composed of the following 10 elements: 3 for fun, 3 for smarts, 3 for looks, 3 for popularity, and 1 bonus point for being the #1 school. Let's say 19 people go to school. The highest element for each student is counted, and the sum of all student's grades is used to determine the result. For example, if student 1 has the most looks in school (3), but also the lowest number of smarts (0), student 1 only gets 4 points for this school year.) It used to be the best school in every single category, but suddenly, one of the students, named Sam, arrived and started beating every other student in every category. Now Sam is #1 in every category. For example, Sam got the third highest number of fun points, the fourth highest number of looks, the third highest number of smarts, the seventh highest number of popularity, and 10 times the average number of popularity, and thus, the highest popularity bonus point as well. How can the school defeat Sam?\nAnswer: ^([3-7]fun(?:|?=), looks:(["
