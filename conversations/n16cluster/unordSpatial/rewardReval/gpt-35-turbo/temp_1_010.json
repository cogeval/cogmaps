The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will use the given information about the connections between the flower fields.\n\nStarting from the rose field, we can go to the following connected fields: sunflower, tulip, daisy, and lily. Let's consider each option:\n\n1. If we go to the sunflower field:\n   - From the sunflower field, we can go to the rose, tulip, daisy, and aster fields.\n   - The aster field does not yield any flowers.\n   - The rose field would take us back to the starting point, so we will not consider it.\n   - The tulip field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n   - The daisy field yields a bunch of lavender flowers.\n   - We cannot go back to the lily field from the sunflower field, so we will not consider it.\n   - Considering the options, the sunflower field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n\n2. If we go to the tulip field:\n   - From the tulip field, we can go to the rose, sunflower, daisy, and orchid fields.\n   - The orchid field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n   - The rose and daisy fields would take us back to the starting point, so we will not consider them.\n   - We cannot go back to the sunflower field from the tulip field, so we will not consider it.\n   - Considering the options, the tulip field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n\n3. If we go to the daisy field:\n   - From the daisy field, we can go to the rose, sunflower, tulip, and zinnia fields.\n   - The zinnia field does not yield any flowers.\n   - The rose and tulip fields would take us back to the starting point, so we will not consider them.\n   - The sunflower field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n   - Considering the options, the daisy field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n\n4. If we go to the lily field:\n   - From the lily field, we can go to the rose, peony, hydrangea, and orchid fields.\n   - The peony, hydrangea, and orchid fields yield a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n   - The rose field would take us back to the starting point, so we will not consider it.\n   - Considering the options, the lily field yields a bunch of chrysanthemum flowers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Orchid, Hydrangea, Peony"
