The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections between fields as edges, where the weights of the edges represent the number of flowers obtained.\n\nThe graph representation is as follows:\n\n- Rose field: Connected to Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Sunflower field: Connected to Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Tulip field: Connected to Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, and Orchid fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Daisy field: Connected to Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, and Zinnia fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Orchid field: Connected to Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, and Tulip fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Hydrangea field: Connected to Orchid, Lily, Peony, and Marigold fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Lily field: Connected to Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, and Orchid fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Peony field: Connected to Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, and Chrysanthemum fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Daffodil field: Connected to Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, and Lavender fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Chrysanthemum field: Connected to Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, and Marigold fields (with a reward of 50 chrysanthemum flowers).\n- Carnation field: Connected to Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, and Chrysanthemum fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Marigold field: Connected to Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, and Hydrangea fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Poppy field: Connected to Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, and Carnation fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Zinnia field: Connected to Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, and Aster fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n- Lavender field: Connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, and Daffodil fields (with a reward of 10 lavender flowers).\n- Aster field: Connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, and Sunflower fields (with no direct flower rewards).\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can determine the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers. The path would be as follows:\n\n1. Rose field (0 flowers)\n2. Sunflower field (0 flowers)\n3. Aster field (0 flowers)\n4. Poppy field (0 flowers)\n5. Zinnia field (0 flowers)\n6. Daisy field (0 flowers)\n7. Daffodil field (0 flowers)\n8. Lavender field (10 lavender flowers)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers includes: Rose, Sunflower, Aster, Poppy, Zinnia, Daisy, Daffodil, and Lavender.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Aster, Poppy, Zinnia, Daisy, Daffodil, Lavender"
