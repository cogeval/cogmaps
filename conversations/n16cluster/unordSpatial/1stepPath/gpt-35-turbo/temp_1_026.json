The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

We'll start by creating a graph representation of the flower county and assigning weights to the edges based on the given connections.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the flower county with 16 flower fields.\n   - The graph should have 16 nodes, each representing a flower field.\n   - The edges between nodes should represent the connections between flower fields.\n\n2. Assign weights to the edges based on the given connections.\n   - The weight of an edge represents the distance between two connected flower fields.\n   - In this case, the weight of each edge is 1 since all connections have equal distances.\n\n3. Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the orchid field to the lily field.\n   - Start by initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the orchid field which is 0.\n   - Explore the neighboring nodes of the current node, updating their distances if a shorter path is found.\n   - Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited or the lily field is reached.\n\n4. Trace back the shortest path from the lily field to the orchid field.\n   - Starting from the lily field, follow the path of nodes with decreasing distance until reaching the orchid field.\n   - Record the flower names in order, including the orchid field, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Tulip, Rose, Lily"
