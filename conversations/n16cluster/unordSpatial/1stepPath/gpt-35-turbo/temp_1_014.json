The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the daisy field what is the shortest path to the tulip field? Starting from daisy, please list the flower names in order, including daisy, separated by commas."

Check the neighboring fields of the daisy field, which are the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field.\n3. Since the tulip field is one of the neighboring fields, we can add it to our path.\n4. Move to the tulip field.\n5. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field, which are the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n6. Since the daisy field is already in our path, we can skip it to avoid cycles.\n7. The remaining neighboring fields are the rose field, sunflower field, and orchid field. We can add the rose field to our path.\n8. Move to the rose field.\n9. Check the neighboring fields of the rose field, which are the sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, and lily field.\n10. Since the daisy field is already in our path, we can skip it.\n11. The remaining neighboring fields are the sunflower field, tulip field, and lily field. We can add the tulip field to our path.\n12. We have reached the tulip field, so the shortest path from the daisy field to the tulip field is \"daisy, rose, tulip\".\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Rose, Tulip"
