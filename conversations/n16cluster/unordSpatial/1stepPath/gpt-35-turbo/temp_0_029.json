The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the zinnia field what is the shortest path to the poppy field? Starting from zinnia, please list the flower names in order, including zinnia, separated by commas."

Start at the zinnia field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the zinnia field: daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue the first field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the poppy field, we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, check the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n   - Add the unvisited neighboring fields to the queue.\n   - Mark the dequeued field as visited.\n5. The shortest path from the zinnia field to the poppy field is the sequence of fields visited during the BFS traversal.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the poppy field is:\n\nAnswer: zinnia, poppy"
