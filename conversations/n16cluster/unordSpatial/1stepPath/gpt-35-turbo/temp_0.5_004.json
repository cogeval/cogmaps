The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue the sunflower field.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the previous field in the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the rose field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighboring field of the dequeued field that has not been visited:\n     - Mark the neighboring field as visited.\n     - Add the neighboring field to the queue.\n     - Set the previous field of the neighboring field as the dequeued field in the dictionary.\n6. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the sunflower field to the rose field.\n   - In this case, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow let's follow these steps:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Rose"
