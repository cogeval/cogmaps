The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field.

I have tried two different ways to create a method that takes in a number, and if the number is divisible by 5 it will print \"yes\" and if it isn't it will print \"no\". The first method I tried is to create a boolean that is true if the number is divisible by 5, and if the boolean is true then I want to print \"yes\". However, I can't figure out how to do this, as I keep getting a \"no\" printed instead of \"yes\".
