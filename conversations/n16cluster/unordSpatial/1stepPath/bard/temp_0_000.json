The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the rose field what is the shortest path to the sunflower field? Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a graph of the flower fields, where each flower field is a node and the edges represent connections between the fields.\n2. Find the shortest path between the rose field and the sunflower field using a Dijkstra algorithm.\n\nThe Dijkstra algorithm works by finding the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and a table of distances to each node. The algorithm starts by adding the starting node to the set of unvisited nodes and setting the distance to the starting node to 0.\n\nThe algorithm then repeatedly does the following:\n\n* Find the node in the set of unvisited nodes with the shortest distance.\n* Add that node to the set of visited nodes.\n* Update the distances to the neighbors of the node that was just added, by taking the minimum of the distance to the node and the distance to its neighbor plus the weight of the edge between the node and its neighbor.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when the set of unvisited nodes is empty. At this point, the table of distances will contain the shortest distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from the rose field to the sunflower field has a distance of 1. The path is:\n\n1. rose\n2. sunflower\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
