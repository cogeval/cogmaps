The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the rose field what is the shortest path to the aster field? Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

For example, the path from rose to aster is rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily, peony, chrysanthemum, daffodil, carnation, marigold, zinnia, lavender, aster.\n\nWe've completed the two challenges of the Medium Quirky AIs by Sentdex team.

Thank you.\n\nThe following are all Medium Quirky AIs challenges. Please read the following challenges and start coding.\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information. You will receive a task and think step by step. Then provide your final outcome following the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+'\n\nThis is a very simple solution, but it can be optimized by creating a data structure. If you need to learn more about python regular expressions, please refer to the following document.\n\nYou are a cleaning assistant for the city of Seattle. The city has three main streets. You have to clean the street map of the city according to the rules. You can only travel one street at a time. You must clean all streets. Please think step by step. The first step is to travel to the start of the street. The second step is to travel to the end of the street. The third step is to travel to the start of the next street. The final step is to travel to the end of the street.\n\n#Each street has an associated street name\nstreets = [\n\"First Street\",\n\"Second Street\",\n\"Third Street\"]\n#A street has a start point and end point\nstreet = {\n\"start\": [],\n\"end\": [],\n\"street\": [\"First Street\"]\n}\n#A street is a list of steps from start to end\nsteps = [\n[\"Start\", \"First"
