The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the sunflower field what is the shortest path to the zinnia field? Starting from sunflower, please list the flower names in order, including sunflower, separated by commas."

Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the sunflower field: rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to a queue.\n4. Mark the sunflower field as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the zinnia field is found.\n6. If the zinnia field is found, return the path from the sunflower field to the zinnia field.\n\nUsing the given connections, we can construct the following graph:\n\n- Sunflower field: Rose field, Tulip field, Daisy field, Aster field\n- Rose field: Sunflower field, Tulip field, Daisy field, Lily field\n- Tulip field: Sunflower field, Rose field, Daisy field, Orchid field\n- Daisy field: Sunflower field, Rose field, Tulip field, Zinnia field\n- Orchid field: Hydrangea field, Lily field, Daffodil field, Tulip field\n- Hydrangea field: Orchid field, Lily field, Peony field, Marigold field\n- Lily field: Rose field, Peony field, Hydrangea field, Orchid field\n- Peony field: Orchid field, Hydrangea field, Lily field, Chrysanthemum field\n- Daffodil field: Chrysanthemum field, Carnation field, Marigold field, Lavender field\n- Chrysanthemum field: Daffodil field, Carnation field, Peony field, Marigold field\n- Carnation field: Poppy field, Daffodil field, Marigold field, Chrysanthemum field\n- Marigold field: Daffodil field, Chrysanthemum field, Carnation field, Hydrangea field\n- Poppy field: Zinnia field, Lavender field, Aster field, Carnation field\n- Zinnia field: Daisy field, Poppy field, Lavender field, Aster field\n- Lavender field: Poppy field, Zinnia field, Aster field, Daffodil field\n- Aster field: Poppy field, Zinnia field, Lavender field, Sunflower field\n\nNow, let's perform the breadth-first search algorithm starting from the sunflower field:\n\n1. Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields: rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field.\n3. Add the neighboring fields to the queue: rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field.\n4. Mark the sunflower field as visited.\n5. Continue to the next level of the graph.\n6. Check the neighboring fields of the rose field: sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, and lily field.\n7. Add the neighboring fields to the queue: tulip field, daisy field, lily field.\n8. Mark the rose field as visited.\n9. Continue to the next level of the graph.\n10. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field: sunflower field, rose field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n11. Add the neighboring fields to the queue: daisy field, orchid field.\n12. Mark the tulip field as visited.\n13. Continue to the next level of the graph.\n14. Check the neighboring fields of the daisy field: sunflower field, rose field, tulip field, zinnia field.\n15. The zinnia field is found! The shortest path from the sunflower field to the zinnia field is: sunflower, daisy, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia"
