The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the aster field what is the shortest path to the daffodil field? Starting from aster, please list the flower names in order, including aster, separated by commas."

Create a queue and enqueue the aster field.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of visited flower fields.\n3. Create a path dictionary to store the previous flower field for each visited flower field.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a flower field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued flower field is the daffodil field, exit the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighboring flower field of the dequeued flower field that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the neighboring flower field to the queue.\n     - Add the neighboring flower field to the visited set.\n     - Add the dequeued flower field as the previous flower field for the neighboring flower field in the path dictionary.\n5. If the daffodil field is not found, return \"Path not found.\"\n\nNow let's implement the algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Aster, Poppy, Daffodil"
