The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the sunflower field what is the shortest path to the orchid field? Starting from sunflower, please list the flower names in order, including sunflower, separated by commas."

Each flower field will be a node, and the connections between fields will be edges.\n\nBased on the given information, the graph representation of the flower county can be as follows:\n\n- Rose field: connected to Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily fields\n- Sunflower field: connected to Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster fields\n- Tulip field: connected to Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, and Orchid fields\n- Daisy field: connected to Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, and Zinnia fields\n- Orchid field: connected to Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, and Tulip fields\n- Hydrangea field: connected to Orchid, Lily, Peony, and Marigold fields\n- Lily field: connected to Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, and Orchid fields\n- Peony field: connected to Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, and Chrysanthemum fields\n- Daffodil field: connected to Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, and Lavender fields\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, and Marigold fields\n- Carnation field: connected to Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, and Chrysanthemum fields\n- Marigold field: connected to Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, and Hydrangea fields\n- Poppy field: connected to Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, and Carnation fields\n- Zinnia field: connected to Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, and Aster fields\n- Lavender field: connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, and Daffodil fields\n- Aster field: connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, and Sunflower fields\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the Sunflower field to the Orchid field using a breadth-first search algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the Sunflower field.\n2. Check if the current field is the Orchid field. If yes, stop.\n3. If not, explore the neighboring fields of the current field.\n4. Enqueue the neighboring fields that have not been visited yet.\n5. Dequeue the next field from the queue and repeat steps 2-5 until the Orchid field is found.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from the Sunflower field to the Orchid field is:\n\nSunflower, Rose, Tulip, Orchid\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Rose, Tulip, Orchid"
