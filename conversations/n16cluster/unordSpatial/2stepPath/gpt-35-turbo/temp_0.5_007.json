The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

Each flower field will be a node in the graph, and the connections between fields will be the edges.\n\n1. Create a graph with 16 nodes representing the flower fields: rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, lily, aster, orchid, hydrangea, daffodil, zinnia, peony, chrysanthemum, carnation, marigold, poppy, and lavender.\n\n2. Add edges to the graph based on the connections mentioned in the problem description:\n   - The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, and lily fields.\n   - The sunflower field is connected to the rose, tulip, daisy, and aster fields.\n   - The tulip field is connected to the rose, sunflower, daisy, and orchid fields.\n   - The daisy field is connected to the rose, sunflower, tulip, and zinnia fields.\n   - The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea, lily, daffodil, and tulip fields.\n   - The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid, lily, peony, and marigold fields.\n   - The lily field is connected to the rose, peony, hydrangea, and orchid fields.\n   - The peony field is connected to the orchid, hydrangea, lily, and chrysanthemum fields.\n   - The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum, carnation, marigold, and lavender fields.\n   - The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, peony, and marigold fields.\n   - The carnation field is connected to the poppy, daffodil, marigold, and chrysanthemum fields.\n   - The marigold field is connected to the daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation, and hydrangea fields.\n   - The poppy field is connected to the zinnia, lavender, aster, and carnation fields.\n   - The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, poppy, lavender, and aster fields.\n   - The lavender field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, aster, and daffodil fields.\n   - The aster field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, lavender, and sunflower fields.\n\n3. Use a shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path from the sunflower field to the zinnia field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Aster, Zinnia"
