The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the aster field what is the shortest path to the carnation field? Starting from aster, please list the flower names in order, including aster, separated by commas."

Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections based on the given information.\n2. Start at the aster field and enqueue it in a queue.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the flower fields we have visited.\n4. Create an empty path dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from the aster field to each flower field.\n5. Initialize the path dictionary with the aster field as the key and an empty list as the value.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue the next flower field from the queue.\n   2. If the flower field is the carnation field, stop the traversal and return the path from the path dictionary.\n   3. If the flower field has not been visited:\n      1. Add it to the visited set.\n      2. Update the path dictionary for the flower field by extending the path from the previous flower field.\n      3. Enqueue all the neighboring flower fields of the current flower field that have not been visited.\n7. If the traversal completes without finding the carnation field, there is no path from the aster field to the carnation field.\n\nBased on this algorithm, the shortest path from the aster field to the carnation field is:\n\nAnswer: Aster, Poppy, Carnation"
