The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the aster field what is the shortest path to the rose field? Starting from aster, please list the flower names in order, including aster, separated by commas."

Starting from the aster field, we will explore its neighboring fields one by one until we reach the rose field. We will keep track of the visited fields to avoid visiting them again.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from the aster field, mark it as visited.\n2. Check if the current field is the rose field. If yes, we have found the shortest path. In this case, the shortest path from aster to rose is just aster, rose.\n3. If the current field is not the rose field, add its neighboring fields to the queue. The neighboring fields are sunflower, zinnia, lavender, and poppy.\n4. Take the first field from the queue. In this case, it is the sunflower field.\n5. Mark the sunflower field as visited.\n6. Check if the current field is the rose field. If yes, we have found the shortest path. In this case, the shortest path from aster to rose is aster, sunflower, rose.\n7. If the current field is not the rose field, add its neighboring fields to the queue. The neighboring fields are tulip, daisy, aster, and rose.\n8. Continue this process until we reach the rose field.\n\nBased on the given information, the shortest path from the aster field to the rose field is:\n\nAnswer: aster, sunflower, rose."
