The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the aster field what is the shortest path to the daisy field? Starting from aster, please list the flower names in order, including aster, separated by commas."

Since the graph is small and doesn't have weighted edges, we can use BFS.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process using BFS:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the flower fields to be explored.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of the flower fields we have already visited.\n3. Start from the aster field and add it to the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a flower field from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if it is the daisy field. If it is, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If it is not the daisy field, mark it as visited and enqueue its neighboring flower fields that haven't been visited yet.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the aster field to the daisy field.\n\nLet's perform the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the aster field to the daisy field:\n\nAnswer: Aster, Sunflower, Daisy"
