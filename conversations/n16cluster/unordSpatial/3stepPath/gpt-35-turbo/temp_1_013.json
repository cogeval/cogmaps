The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the daisy field what is the shortest path to the peony field? Starting from daisy, please list the flower names in order, including daisy, separated by commas."

We start at the daisy field and iteratively move to its neighboring fields, keeping track of the shortest path to each field.\n\n1. Start at the daisy field.\n2. The daisy field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. We will consider the neighbors in alphabetical order.\n    - Move from the daisy field to the rose field.\n    - Move from the daisy field to the sunflower field.\n    - Move from the daisy field to the tulip field.\n    - Move from the daisy field to the zinnia field.\n3. Among the neighboring fields, the tulip field is the closest to the peony field. We add the tulip field to our path and move to the tulip field.\n4. At the tulip field, we check its neighboring fields: rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n    - Move from the tulip field to the rose field.\n    - Move from the tulip field to the sunflower field.\n    - Move from the tulip field to the daisy field.\n    - Move from the tulip field to the orchid field.\n5. Among the neighboring fields, the orchid field is the closest to the peony field. We add the orchid field to our path and move to the orchid field.\n6. At the orchid field, we check its neighboring fields: hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field.\n    - Move from the orchid field to the hydrangea field.\n    - Move from the orchid field to the lily field.\n    - Move from the orchid field to the daffodil field.\n    - Move from the orchid field to the tulip field.\n7. Among the neighboring fields, the peony field is the closest to the peony field. We add the peony field to our path.\n8.
