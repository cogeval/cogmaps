The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

Check if the tulip field is connected to the lavender field directly. If yes, then the shortest path is just \"tulip, lavender\".\n3. If not, create a queue and add the tulip field to it.\n4. Create an empty set to keep track of visited flower fields.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the parent field for each field.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a flower field from the queue.\n   2. If the dequeued field is the lavender field, stop the search.\n   3. Otherwise, for each adjacent field that has not been visited:\n      1. Add the adjacent field to the visited set.\n      2. Add the adjacent field to the queue.\n      3. Set the parent field of the adjacent field to the dequeued field.\n7. If the search reaches this point, it means there is no path from the tulip field to the lavender field.\n8. If the search finds a path to the lavender field, backtrack from the lavender field to the tulip field using the parent field dictionary to find the shortest path.\n9. Return the shortest path as a comma-separated list of flower names.\n\nAnswer: tulip, rose, sunflower, aster, lavender"
