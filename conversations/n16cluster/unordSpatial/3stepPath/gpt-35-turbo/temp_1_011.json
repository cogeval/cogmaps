The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the tulip field what is the shortest path to the chrysanthemum field? Starting from tulip, please list the flower names in order, including tulip, separated by commas."

Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections as follows:\n   - tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n   - rose field is connected to the tulip field, sunflower field, daisy field, and lily field.\n   - sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, aster field, and chrysanthemum field.\n   - daisy field is connected to the tulip field, rose field, sunflower field, zinnia field, and chrysanthemum field.\n   - orchid field is connected to the tulip field, hydrangea field, lily field, and daffodil field.\n   - hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field.\n   - lily field is connected to the rose field, orchid field, hydrangea field, and peony field.\n   - peony field is connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field.\n   - chrysanthemum field is connected to the daisy field, peony field, carnation field, and marigold field.\n   - daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field.\n   - carnation field is connected to the peony field, chrysanthemum field, poppy field, and marigold field.\n   - marigold field is connected to the hydrangea field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, daffodil field, and poppy field.\n   - poppy field is connected to the carnation field, zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and marigold field.\n   - zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, aster field, and marigold field.\n   - lavender field is connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field.\n   - aster field is connected to the sunflower field, poppy field, zinnia field, and lavender field.\n\n2. Initialize the distances to all flower fields from the tulip field as infinity, except for the tulip field itself which is 0. Also, initialize an empty set of visited flower fields.\n\n3. While there are unvisited flower fields:\n   - Select the flower field with the minimum distance from the tulip field (initially the tulip field itself).\n   - Mark the selected flower field as visited.\n   - Update the distances to its neighboring flower fields if they are shorter than the current distances.\n\n4. Once all flower fields are visited, the shortest path from the tulip field to the chrysanthemum field can be obtained by backtracking from the chrysanthemum field to the tulip field using the updated distances and the connections between the flower fields.\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Daisy, Chrysanthemum"
