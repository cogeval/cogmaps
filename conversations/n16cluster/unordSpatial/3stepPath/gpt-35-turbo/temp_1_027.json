The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the orchid field what is the shortest path to the carnation field? Starting from orchid, please list the flower names in order, including orchid, separated by commas."

Create a graph of the flower fields and their connections:\n   - Create a node for each flower field: rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, lily, aster, orchid, hydrangea, peony, daffodil, zinnia, carnation, marigold, chrysanthemum, poppy, lavender.\n   - Add edges between connected fields as described in the question.\n\n2. Initialize the distances from the orchid field to all other fields:\n   - Set the distance to the orchid field as 0.\n   - Set the distance to all other fields as infinity.\n\n3. While there are unvisited fields:\n   - Select the field with the minimum distance that has not been visited yet.\n   - For each neighbor of the selected field, calculate the distance from the orchid field and update the minimum distance if necessary.\n\n4. Once all fields have been visited, trace back the shortest path from the carnation field to the orchid field:\n   - Start from the carnation field and follow the path of minimum distances back to the orchid field.\n   - List the flower names in the order visited, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: orchid, tulip, daisy, zinnia, poppy, carnation"
