The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the aster field what is the shortest path to the orchid field? Starting from aster, please list the flower names in order, including aster, separated by commas."

Starting from the aster field, we check its connections: poppy, zinnia, lavender, and sunflower.\n2. From the aster field, we first explore the poppy field. But the poppy field is not connected to the orchid field, so we move on to the next connection.\n3. Next, we explore the zinnia field. Again, the zinnia field is not connected to the orchid field, so we move on.\n4. Then, we explore the lavender field. Unfortunately, the lavender field is not connected to the orchid field, so we move on.\n5. Finally, we explore the sunflower field. The sunflower field is connected to the tulip field, daisy field, and aster field. However, we have already visited the aster field, so we ignore it. The sunflower field is also connected to the rose field, but it is not the orchid field, so we move on.\n\nSince we have explored all the connections from the aster field and none of them lead to the orchid field, there is no path from the aster field to the orchid field.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from the aster field to the orchid field."
