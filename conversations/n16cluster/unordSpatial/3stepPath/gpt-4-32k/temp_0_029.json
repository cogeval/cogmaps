The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the zinnia field what is the shortest path to the orchid field? Starting from zinnia, please list the flower names in order, including zinnia, separated by commas."

Tulip field is connected to Orchid field.\n- Poppy field is connected to Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, and Carnation. None of these fields are directly connected to the Orchid field.\n- Lavender field is connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, and Daffodil. None of these fields are directly connected to the Orchid field.\n- Aster field is connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, and Sunflower. None of these fields are directly connected to the Orchid field.\n\nStep 4: Identify the shortest path from the connected fields to the Orchid field.\n- From Daisy field, the shortest path is through Tulip field (Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid).\n- From Poppy, Lavender, and Aster fields, there is no direct connection to the Orchid field, so the shortest path is longer than the one from Daisy field.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid"
