The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the peony field what is the shortest path to the zinnia field? Starting from peony, please list the flower names in order, including peony, separated by commas."

No Zinnia.\n- Hydrangea: Connected to Orchid, Lily, Peony, and Marigold. No Zinnia.\n- Lily: Connected to Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, and Orchid. No Zinnia.\n- Chrysanthemum: Connected to Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, and Marigold. No Zinnia.\n\nStep 3: Since there is no direct connection, we must check the next set of fields connected to the ones in step 2.\n\n- Orchid: Check Tulip, which connects to Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, and Orchid.\n- Hydrangea: Already checked in Step 2.\n- Lily: Already checked in Step 2.\n- Chrysanthemum: Already checked in Step 2.\n\nStep 4: We find that Daisy field is connected to Zinnia field.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Peony to Zinnia field is: Peony, Orchid, Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Peony, Orchid, Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia"
