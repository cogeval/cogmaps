In this case, Panda Express and Yogurtland are the closest, as they are connected to some buildings that are directly connected to the art library.\nStep 4: Determine the buildings connected to Panda Express and Yogurtland. Panda Express is connected to swimming center, and Yogurtland is connected to health center.\nStep 5: From the connected buildings in step 4, identify the ones that have a direct connection to the art library. In this case, health center is directly connected to the art library.\nStep 6: As we have found a direct connection from health center to the art library, the shortest path from science library to the art library would be science library -> Yogurtland -> health center -> art library.\n\nAnswer: Science library, Yogurtland, Health center, Art library"
