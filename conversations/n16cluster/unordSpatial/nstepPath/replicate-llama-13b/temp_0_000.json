The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the lavender field what is the shortest path to the lily field? Starting from lavender, please list the flower names in order, including lavender, separated by commas."

Assume that if the final tank amount of gasoline is greater than zero, it is full.\nAnswer: A 4-digit number has a three-digit number as its last two digits and also a two-digit number as the first two digits. The three-digit number is 20% smaller than the two-digit number. For the given numbers, find what the three-digit number is and what the two-digit number is.\nuser: A triangle ABC is drawn. A ray is extended from A so that the chord formed meets the side BC of the triangle. Now the ray is reflected from the side BC and meets BC again. If C is on side BC, what is the value of the acute angle CAB?\nAnswer: A polygon has a total of \u03c0 / 4 radians of area and 4 diagonals. For each of the n diagonals Dk (k= 1 ..n ), the length is always equal to the angle between Dk and the polygon's sides, which is equal to \u03c0 / 4k + (a - \u03c0 / 4k), where a is the area of the polygon.
