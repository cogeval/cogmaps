The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the peony field what is the shortest path to the zinnia field? Starting from peony, please list the flower names in order, including peony, separated by commas."

Check if the peony field is connected to the zinnia field. If yes, the shortest path is just \"peony, zinnia\". If not, continue to the next step.\n3. Create a queue to store the fields to be visited.\n4. Enqueue the peony field.\n5. Create a visited set to keep track of the visited fields.\n6. Add the peony field to the visited set.\n7. Create a dictionary to store the parent field for each field.\n8. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued field is the zinnia field. If yes, break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighboring field of the dequeued field that has not been visited, do the following steps:\n     - Enqueue the neighboring field.\n     - Add the neighboring field to the visited set.\n     - Set the parent field of the neighboring field as the dequeued field in the dictionary.\n9. If the zinnia field is not found, there is no path from the peony field to the zinnia field.\n10. If the zinnia field is found, construct the shortest path by following the parent fields from the zinnia field to the peony field.\n11. Reverse the constructed path to get the correct order.\n12. Return the shortest path as a comma-separated list of flower names.\n\nAnswer: peony, hydrangea, orchid, zinnia"
