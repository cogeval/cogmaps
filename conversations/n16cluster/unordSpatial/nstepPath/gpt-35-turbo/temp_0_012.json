The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

Start at the orchid field.\n2. Check the neighboring fields of the orchid field: hydrangea, lily, daffodil, and tulip.\n3. Move to the tulip field.\n4. Check the neighboring fields of the tulip field: rose, sunflower, daisy, and orchid (already visited).\n5. Move to the daisy field.\n6. Check the neighboring fields of the daisy field: rose, sunflower, tulip, and zinnia.\n7. Move to the zinnia field.\n8. Check the neighboring fields of the zinnia field: daisy (already visited), poppy, lavender, and aster.\n9. Move to the poppy field.\n\nThe shortest path from the orchid field to the poppy field is: orchid, tulip, daisy, zinnia, poppy.\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia, Poppy"
