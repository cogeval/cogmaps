The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the peony field what is the shortest path to the aster field? Starting from peony, please list the flower names in order, including peony, separated by commas."

Let's first represent the connections between the flower fields:\n\nPeony -> Orchid -> Tulip -> Sunflower -> Aster\n\nNow let's calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the peony field.\n2. Set the distance to the peony field as 0 and all other distances as infinity.\n3. Mark the peony field as visited.\n4. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the peony field: orchid, hydrangea, lily, and chrysanthemum. \n   - The distance to orchid is 1 (peony field -> orchid field).\n   - The distance to hydrangea is infinity (not connected).\n   - The distance to lily is infinity (not connected).\n   - The distance to chrysanthemum is infinity (not connected).\n5. Select the unvisited field with the smallest distance (orchid).\n6. Mark the orchid field as visited.\n7. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the orchid field: peony, hydrangea, lily, and tulip.\n   - The distance to peony is 1 (orchid field -> peony field).\n   - The distance to hydrangea is 2 (orchid field -> hydrangea field).\n   - The distance to lily is infinity (not connected).\n   - The distance to tulip is infinity (not connected).\n8. Select the unvisited field with the smallest distance (peony).\n9. Since we have reached the aster field, the shortest path from peony to aster is: Peony, Orchid, Tulip, Sunflower, Aster.\n\nAnswer: Peony, Orchid, Tulip, Sunflower, Aster"
