The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the chrysanthemum field what is the shortest path to the daisy field? Starting from chrysanthemum, please list the flower names in order, including chrysanthemum, separated by commas."

Initialize the distance from the chrysanthemum field to all other fields as infinity, except for the distance from the chrysanthemum field to itself, which is 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited fields and add all the fields in the flower county to it.\n3. While the set of unvisited fields is not empty:\n    a. Select the field with the smallest distance from the chrysanthemum field (initially, this will be the chrysanthemum field itself).\n    b. For each neighboring field that is still in the set of unvisited fields:\n        - Calculate the distance from the chrysanthemum field to this neighboring field through the current field. If this distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance, update it.\n    c. Remove the current field from the set of unvisited fields.\n4. Once we have visited all the fields, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the chrysanthemum field to the daisy field by following the recorded distances.\n\nAnswer: Chrysanthemum, Marigold, Daffodil, Daisy"
