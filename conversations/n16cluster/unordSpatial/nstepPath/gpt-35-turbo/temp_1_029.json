The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the lavender field what is the shortest path to the lily field? Starting from lavender, please list the flower names in order, including lavender, separated by commas."

Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections:\n\n   - Lavender field: Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, Daffodil\n   - Poppy field: Zinnia, Daisy, Lavender, Carnation\n   - Zinnia field: Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, Aster\n   - Aster field: Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, Sunflower\n   - Sunflower field: Rose, Tulip, Daisy, Aster\n   - Rose field: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Lily\n   - Tulip field: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid\n   - Daisy field: Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Zinnia\n   - Orchid field: Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, Tulip\n   - Hydrangea field: Orchid, Lily, Peony, Marigold\n   - Lily field: Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, Orchid\n   - Peony field: Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, Chrysanthemum\n   - Chrysanthemum field: Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, Marigold\n   - Daffodil field: Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, Lavender\n   - Carnation field: Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, Chrysanthemum\n   - Marigold field: Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Hydrangea\n\n2. Initialize the distance of all flower fields as infinity, except for the lavender field which is 0, since it is the starting point.\n\n3. Mark all flower fields as unvisited.\n\n4. Set the current flower field as lavender and initialize an empty path.\n\n5. While there are unvisited flower fields:\n   - Mark the current flower field as visited.\n   - For each neighboring flower field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current flower field to the neighboring flower field.\n     - If the calculated distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and update the path.\n\n6. The shortest path from lavender to lily is the path recorded when we reach the lily field.\n\nAnswer: Lavender, Poppy, Daisy, Rose, Lily"
