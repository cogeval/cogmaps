The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the daisy field what is the shortest path to the chrysanthemum field? Starting from daisy, please list the flower names in order, including daisy, separated by commas."

Starting from the daisy field, the neighbors are the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field.\n2. From the daisy field, we will explore each neighbor field in a queue fashion. So, the queue now contains: rose, sunflower, tulip, and zinnia.\n3. Next, we will explore the neighbors of each field in the queue. For the rose field, the neighbors are daisy (already visited), sunflower, tulip, and lily. For the sunflower field, the neighbors are rose (already visited), tulip, daisy (already visited), and aster. For the tulip field, the neighbors are rose (already visited), sunflower (already visited), daisy (already visited), and orchid. For the zinnia field, the neighbors are daisy (already visited), poppy, lavender, and aster.\n4. Continuing the process, we explore each neighbor field and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited. The queue now contains: sunflower, tulip, zinnia, aster, lily, and orchid.\n5. We keep repeating this process until we reach the chrysanthemum field. The queue now contains: tulip, zinnia, aster, lily, orchid, and peony.\n6. Finally, the shortest path from the daisy field to the chrysanthemum field is: daisy, tulip, orchid, peony, and chrysanthemum.\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Peony, Chrysanthemum."
