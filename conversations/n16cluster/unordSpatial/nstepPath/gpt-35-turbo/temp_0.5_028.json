The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. From the lavender field what is the shortest path to the orchid field? Starting from lavender, please list the flower names in order, including lavender, separated by commas."

Initialize a distance array to keep track of the shortest distance from the lavender field to each flower field. Set the distance of the lavender field to 0 and the distance of all other flower fields to infinity.\n3. Create a priority queue to store the flower fields based on their distances.\n4. Add the lavender field to the priority queue.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the flower field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring flower field of the current flower field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current flower field to the neighboring flower field.\n     - If this distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring flower field, update its distance in the distance array and add it to the priority queue.\n6. After the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the lavender field to all other flower fields.\n7. The shortest path from the lavender field to the orchid field can be obtained by backtracking from the orchid field using the distance array.\n\nAnswer: lavender, poppy, zinnia, daisy, orchid"
