The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here, I'm using strong connectivity instead of weak to ensure that the path goes in a nice logical ordering because with these connections there could otherwise easily multiple order options for the same or lower price (where we are trying to maximize the flower yield here). A strong-connected component here in this flower garden graph is something all fields in which when reaching any field all following fields connected to are guaranteed connections to this flower fields. Starting at a rose: 1) You have lavender, poppy aster connected to you, and sunflowers are too, you cannot choose right this case because we go somewhere other then connect. Next stop you try the next available field and travel straight from your starting point so that's over to your first destination and travel to lavender. 2) When reaching lavender you already mentioned can pick that field because sun, daffodils next to field to collect those also but if your free bunch does not have chrysanthemums still the two additional bunch destinations after chrsyanemes and orchids to consider lavenders still there! So you collect in bunch  Lav. Then when moving offsite travel through aster, or daisies connected to next destination poppy: 10 poppy, lavender field! To get max amount fields now. This poppied field bunch 1. Then poppy, you now collect both zinnia and aster too bunches 2 & 3 respectively! Orchids then field bunch, but because hydrangeas just a single and daffs too, you decide to move in field in any particular and do next to decide and do, hyd and orchids not available! After zinnias next poppy field visited by just travel straight after reaching all. This travel poppy in 5 so then go straight across.  Next reach last and you stop with many flower bunches of your field in different orders and locations! You visit tiger too because there can just so we are not doing chrys and sun any favors and chrys fields just chris you decide not to get that  free or cheap (not the priority and your last flower stop): Bands: First Lav + Rose field and order: Field Rose Daff Aste + Chris Lilies + Pe Hy Ori Mar Popp + Och \nSo collect this maximum ordered batched field flowers to your next steps so there may appear opportunities at any time without preorder that is to complete some field bunch collecton but that is after the first order.
