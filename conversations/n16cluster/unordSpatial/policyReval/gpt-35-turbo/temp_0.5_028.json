The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the number of flowers obtained at each field and select the field with the maximum number of flowers at each step. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Initialize a queue and add the rose field to it.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of flowers obtained at each field.\n4. Initialize the number of flowers at the rose field to 0.\n5. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the previous field visited for each field.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   b. Check if the field has not been visited before. If it hasn't, proceed; otherwise, skip to the next iteration.\n   c. If the field is the chrysanthemum field, stop the algorithm.\n   d. For each neighboring field of the current field, do the following steps:\n      i. If the neighboring field has not been visited before, add it to the queue.\n      ii. Update the number of flowers obtained at the neighboring field based on the flowers obtained at the current field and the flowers available at the neighboring field.\n      iii. Update the previous field visited for the neighboring field.\n7. Start from the chrysanthemum field and backtrack using the previous field visited until reaching the rose field, keeping track of the flower names in order.\n8. Return the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
