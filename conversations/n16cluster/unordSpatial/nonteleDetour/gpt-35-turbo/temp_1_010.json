The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Based on the given information, we can create a graph representing the connections between the fields and the number of flowers in each field.\n\nThe graph can be represented as follows:\n\n- Rose Field: Connected to Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily fields. No flowers available.\n- Sunflower Field: Connected to Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster fields. No flowers available.\n- Tulip Field: Connected to Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, and Orchid fields. No flowers available.\n- Daisy Field: Connected to Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, and Zinnia fields. No flowers available.\n- Lily Field: Connected to Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, and Orchid fields. No flowers available.\n- Orchid Field: Connected to Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, and Tulip fields. No flowers available.\n- Hydrangea Field: Connected to Orchid, Lily, Peony, and Marigold fields. No flowers available.\n- Peony Field: Connected to Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, and Chrysanthemum fields. No flowers available.\n- Daffodil Field: Connected to Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, and Lavender fields. No flowers available.\n- Chrysanthemum Field: Connected to Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, and Marigold fields. 50 chrysanthemum flowers available.\n- Carnation Field: Connected to Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, and Chrysanthemum fields. No flowers available.\n- Marigold Field: Connected to Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, and Hydrangea fields. No flowers available.\n- Poppy Field: Connected to Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, and Carnation fields. No flowers available.\n- Zinnia Field: Connected to Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, and Aster fields. No flowers available.\n- Lavender Field: Connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, and Daffodil fields. 10 lavender flowers available.\n- Aster Field: Connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, and Sunflower fields. No flowers available.\n\nTo find the shortest path with the maximum number of flowers starting from the Rose Field, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. From the Rose Field, we have the following options: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily fields.\n2. Since none of these fields have any flowers available, we can ignore them.\n3. There are no other fields connected to the Rose Field, so the shortest path ends here.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the Rose Field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose.\n\nAnswer: Rose"
