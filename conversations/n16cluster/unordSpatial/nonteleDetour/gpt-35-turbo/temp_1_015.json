The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we will explore all possible paths and keep track of the number of flowers obtained in each path.\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a dictionary to keep track of visited fields.\n\n2. Enqueue the starting field, which is the rose field, to the queue.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n\n4. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n\n5. If the dequeued field is the chrysanthemum field, the shortest path has been found. Return the path taken to reach this field, including the rose field, separated by commas.\n\n6. If the dequeued field has not been visited, add it to the visited dictionary.\n\n7. Enqueue all the adjacent fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue is empty.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Chrysanthemum"

While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n\n4. Dequeue a field from the queue.\n\n5. If the dequeued field is the chrysanthemum field, the shortest path has been found.

Enqueue all the adjacent fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited and are not blocked.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue is empty.\n\nIn this case, since the path from rose to lily field is blocked, we need to consider alternative paths. Let's analyze the paths available from the rose field and find the one that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\nThe paths available from the rose field are as follows:\n\n- Rose -> Sunflower -> Aster -> Zinnia -> Poppy -> Lavender\n- Rose -> Sunflower -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Hydrangea -> Lily\n- Rose -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Zinnia -> Poppy -> Lavender\n- Rose -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Hydrangea -> Lily\n\nLet's count the number of flowers obtained in each path:\n\n- First path: 50 chrysanthemum flowers.\n- Second path: 0 chrysanthemum flowers.\n- Third path: 50 chrysanthemum flowers.\n- Fourth path: 0 chrysanthemum flowers.\n\nSince the first and third paths both yield the maximum number of 50 chrysanthemum flowers, we can choose either one. Let's choose the first path for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Aster, Zinnia, Poppy, Lavender"
