The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will start at the rose field and explore all possible paths while keeping track of the number of flowers collected. The algorithm will terminate when we reach a field that has no unexplored connections or when we have visited all fields.\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all fields as infinity, except for the rose field, which is set to 0. Set the number of flowers collected at each field as 0.\n\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields to be explored, prioritized by the distance.\n\n3. Add the rose field to the priority queue.\n\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - If the field has already been visited, continue to the next iteration.\n   - Mark the field as visited.\n   - For each neighboring field, do the following:\n     - Calculate the number of flowers collected if we take the flowers from the current field.\n     - If this number is greater than the number of flowers collected at the neighboring field, update the number of flowers collected and the distance.\n     - Enqueue the neighboring field with the updated distance.\n\n5. After exploring all possible paths, the maximum number of flowers collected will be stored at each field.\n\n6. To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we will trace back from the lavender field to the rose field.\n   - Start at the lavender field.\n   - While the current field is not the rose field, do the following:\n     - Add the current field to the list of flowers.\n     - Find the neighboring field with the highest number of flowers collected.\n     - Set the current field to the neighboring field.\n\n7.
