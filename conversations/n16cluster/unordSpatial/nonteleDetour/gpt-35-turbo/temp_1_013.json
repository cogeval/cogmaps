The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the number of flowers obtained at each field and select the path with the maximum number of flowers. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Initialize an empty queue to store the fields to be visited.\n3. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained at each field.\n4. Enqueue the rose field to the queue.\n5. Initialize the number of flowers obtained at the rose field as 0.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n    - If the field has not been visited before, update the number of flowers obtained at the current field:\n        - If the current field is the chrysanthemum field, add 50 to the number of flowers obtained.\n        - If the current field is the lavender field, add 10 to the number of flowers obtained.\n        - Otherwise, add 1 to the number of flowers obtained.\n    - Mark the current field as visited.\n    - Enqueue all neighboring fields that have not been visited yet.\n7. Once the queue is empty, we have visited all reachable fields from the rose field. The final number of flowers obtained at each field is stored in the dictionary.\n8. Find the field with the maximum number of flowers obtained.\n9. Traverse back from the field with the maximum number of flowers to the rose field by selecting the neighboring field with the maximum number of flowers at each step.\n10. Return the path from the rose field to the field with the maximum number of flowers, including the field names separated by commas.\n\nNow let's execute these steps and find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
