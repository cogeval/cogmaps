Law school building is connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, health center, and gym. Computer science building is connected to rooms electrical engineering building, law school building , health center and Starbucks. Health center is also connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, law school buildings, and Yogurtland. Starbucks is connected to bioscience building, art library, student union building, and computer science building. Bioscience building is connected to Starbucks, art library, student union building, and KFC. Art library is connected to electrical engineering building, student union building, bioscience building, and Starbucks. Student union building is also connected to Starbucks, bioscience building, art library, and football stadium. Musical theater is connected to football stadium, swimming center, KFC, and science library. Football stadium is connected to musical theater, swimming center, student union building, and KFC. Swimming center is connected to Panda Express, musical theater, KFC, and football stadium. KFC is also connected to musical theater, football stadium, swimming center, and bioscience building. Panda Express is connected to Yogurtland, science library, gym, and swimming center. Yogurtland is connected to health center, Panda Express, science library and gym. Science library is connected to Panda Express, Yogurtland, gym, and musical theater. Gym is also connected to Panda Express, Yogurtland, science library, and law school building. Initially, you were told that there is a reward of 5 for visiting gym, and a reward of 10 for visiting football stadium. Also, there is a penalty of 15 for visiting Starbucks. You have been told that the gym is now connected to the musical theater. From electrical engineering building what is the path to the building that yields the most reward? Please list the buildings in order, separated by commas."
