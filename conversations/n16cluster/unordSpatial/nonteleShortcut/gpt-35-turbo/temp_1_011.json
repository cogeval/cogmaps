The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a graph with 16 flower fields and their connections as mentioned in the given information.\n2. Set the initial distance of all fields to infinity, except the rose field which has a distance of 0.\n3. Create a priority queue and add the rose field to it.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field of the removed field:\n     - Calculate the total distance to reach the neighboring field from the removed field.\n     - If the total distance is less than the current distance of the neighboring field, update its distance with the total distance and add it to the priority queue.\n5. After the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest distances from the rose field to all other fields.\n6. Determine the field with the maximum number of flowers based on the given information:\n   - The chrysanthemum field gives a bunch of 50 flowers for free.\n   - The lavender field gives a bunch of 10 flowers for free.\n7. Starting from the rose field, follow the shortest path to maximize the number of flowers:\n   - Follow the shortest path to a field that gives a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free.\n   - Continue following the shortest path until reaching a field that gives a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free.\n   - Finally, return the path of fields in order, including the rose field, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
