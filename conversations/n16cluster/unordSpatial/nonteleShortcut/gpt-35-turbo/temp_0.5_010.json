The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's examine the connections of these fields:\n\n- The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field.\n- The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n- The daisy field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field.\n- The lily field is connected to the rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, we need to choose the path that allows us to visit the most flower fields. From the rose field, we can choose either the sunflower field or the tulip field as our first step. Let's compare the paths:\n\nPath 1: Rose -> Sunflower -> Aster\nPath 2: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid\n\nFrom the sunflower field, we can only visit the aster field, while from the tulip field, we can visit the orchid field. Since the orchid field is connected to more flower fields (hydrangea and lily), we should choose Path 2.\n\nContinuing from the tulip field, we can visit the orchid field, which is connected to the hydrangea and lily fields. Let's compare the paths:\n\nPath 2: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Hydrangea\nPath 3: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily\n\nFrom the hydrangea field, we can only visit the lily field, while from the orchid field, we can visit the hydrangea field. Since the lily field is connected to more flower fields (rose and peony), we should choose Path 3.\n\nContinuing from the lily field, we can visit the rose field or the peony field. Let's compare the paths:\n\nPath 3: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Rose\nPath 4: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Peony\n\nFrom the rose field, we can only visit the tulip field, while from the lily field, we can visit the rose field. Since the peony field is connected to more flower fields (orchid, hydrangea, and chrysanthemum), we should choose Path 4.\n\nFinally, from the peony field, we can visit the chrysanthemum field. Therefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum"

Let's compare the paths:\n\nPath 1: Rose -> Sunflower -> Aster\nPath 2: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Hydrangea\nPath 3: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Rose\nPath 4: Rose -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Peony -> Chrysanthemum\nPath 5: Rose -> Dahlia\n\nFrom the sunflower field, tulip field, orchid field, and lily field, we have already examined the paths and determined that they do not lead to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, we can exclude Paths 1, 2, 3, and 4 from consideration.\n\nConsidering Path 5, starting from the rose field, we can directly go to the dahlia field. However, the dahlia field is not connected to any other flower fields, so we cannot visit any additional fields.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers remains as:\n\nRose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
