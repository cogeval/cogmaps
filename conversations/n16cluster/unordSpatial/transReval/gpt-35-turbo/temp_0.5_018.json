The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's start by creating a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections:\n\n- Rose field: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Lily\n- Sunflower field: Rose, Tulip, Daisy, Aster\n- Tulip field: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid\n- Daisy field: Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Zinnia\n- Orchid field: Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, Tulip\n- Hydrangea field: Orchid, Lily, Peony, Marigold\n- Lily field: Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, Orchid\n- Peony field: Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, Chrysanthemum\n- Daffodil field: Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, Lavender\n- Chrysanthemum field: Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, Marigold\n- Carnation field: Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, Chrysanthemum\n- Marigold field: Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Hydrangea\n- Poppy field: Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, Carnation\n- Zinnia field: Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, Aster\n- Lavender field: Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, Daffodil\n- Aster field: Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, Sunflower\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers. We will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nStarting from the rose field, we will visit the neighboring fields in a breadth-first manner until we reach a field with free flowers. We will keep track of the number of flowers we can collect in each field.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start from the rose field and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue the rose field and mark it as visited.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of flowers collected.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the path of fields visited.\n5. Initialize a variable to store the current number of flowers collected.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the field has free flowers:\n     - If yes, update the maximum number of flowers collected and the path of fields visited if the current number of flowers collected is greater than the previous maximum.\n   - For each neighboring field of the dequeued field that is not visited, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the neighboring field.\n     - Mark the neighboring field as visited.\n     - Update the current number of flowers collected based on the type of flower in the neighboring field.\n     - Append the neighboring field to the path of fields visited.\n7. Return the path of fields visited with the maximum number of flowers collected.\n\nNow, let's execute this algorithm to find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Aster, Poppy, Carnation, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum"
