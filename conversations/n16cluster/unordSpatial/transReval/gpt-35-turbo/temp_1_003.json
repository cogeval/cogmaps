The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose Field -> Sunflower Field: This path would allow us to collect a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free at the chrysanthemum field, which is connected to the sunflower field. However, this path does not offer any additional free flowers, so it is not the optimal choice.\n\n2. Rose Field -> Tulip Field: This path would allow us to collect a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free at the lavender field, which is connected to the tulip field. Additionally, the tulip field is connected to the orchid field, where we can collect a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Therefore, this path offers a total of 60 flowers (10 lavender + 50 chrysanthemum).\n\n3. Rose Field -> Daisy Field: This path does not offer any additional free flowers beyond the initial rose field, so it is not the optimal choice.\n\n4. Rose Field -> Lily Field: This path does not offer any additional free flowers beyond the initial rose field, so it is not the optimal choice.\n\nBased on our analysis, the optimal path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field\n\nAnswer: Rose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field"

Rose Field -> Sunflower Field: This path now connects to the marigold field. However, none of the fields connected to the marigold field offer any additional free flowers. Therefore, this path does not yield any additional flowers beyond the initial rose field.\n\n2.

Therefore, this path offers a total of 50 flowers (50 chrysanthemum).\n\n3. Rose Field -> Daisy Field: This path now connects to the lily field. However, since the path from the rose field to the lily field is blocked, we cannot proceed further. Therefore, this path does not yield any additional flowers beyond the initial rose field.\n\nBased on our analysis, the optimal path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field\n\nAnswer: Rose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field"
