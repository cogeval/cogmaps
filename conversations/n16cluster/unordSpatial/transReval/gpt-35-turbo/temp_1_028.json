The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we will explore all possible paths and keep track of the number of flowers in each path. We will select the path with the maximum number of flowers at the end. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty visited set.\n2. Enqueue the starting node, \"rose\", into the queue.\n3. Create an empty list to store the flowers in the path.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\n   - Add the flower name of the current node to the flower list.\n   - If the current node is the chrysanthemum field, stop the search and return the flower list.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all neighboring fields of the current node that have not been visited.\n5. If the search ends without finding the chrysanthemum field, return an empty list.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
