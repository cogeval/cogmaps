You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

            "content": "To find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nFirst, let's represent the flower fields and their connections as a graph:\n\n- Rose field: connected to Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily fields.\n- Sunflower field: connected to Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster fields.\n- Tulip field: connected to Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, and Orchid fields.\n- Daisy field: connected to Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, and Zinnia fields.\n- Orchid field: connected to Hydrangea, Lily, Daffodil, and Tulip fields.\n- Hydrangea field: connected to Orchid, Lily, Peony, and Marigold fields.\n- Lily field: connected to Rose, Peony, Hydrangea, and Orchid fields.\n- Peony field: connected to Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, and Chrysanthemum fields.\n- Daffodil field: connected to Chrysanthemum, Carnation, Marigold, and Lavender fields.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to Daffodil, Carnation, Peony, and Marigold fields.\n- Carnation field: connected to Poppy, Daffodil, Marigold, and Chrysanthemum fields.\n- Marigold field: connected to Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation, and Hydrangea fields.\n- Poppy field: connected to Zinnia, Lavender, Aster, and Carnation fields.\n- Zinnia field: connected to Daisy, Poppy, Lavender, and Aster fields.\n- Lavender field: connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Aster, and Daffodil fields.\n- Aster field: connected to Poppy, Zinnia, Lavender, and Sunflower fields.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm starting from the Rose field:\n\n1. Create a priority queue to store the fields to visit, with the Rose field as the starting point.\n2. Initialize the distance to each field as infinity, except for the Rose field which is 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Get the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighboring field:\n     - Calculate the distance to the neighboring field from the current field.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance to the neighboring field:\n       - Update the distance to the neighboring field.\n       - Update the path to the neighboring field.\n       - Add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n4. Once the algorithm finishes, the shortest path from the Rose field to each field is determined.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start from the Rose field.\n2. The neighboring fields are Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily.\n3. Calculate the distance to each neighboring field:\n   - Sunflower field: 1 (Rose to Sunflower)\n   - Tulip field: 1 (Rose to Tulip)\n   - Daisy field: 1 (Rose to Daisy)\n   - Lily field: 1 (Rose to Lily)\n4.

Add the neighboring fields (Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Lily) to the priority queue.\n6. Repeat the process for the next field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - The next field is Sunflower.\n   - The neighboring fields are Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster.\n   - Calculate the distance to each neighboring field:\n     - Rose field: 1 (Sunflower to Rose)\n     - Tulip field: 1 (Sunflower to Tulip)\n     - Daisy field: 1 (Sunflower to Daisy)\n     - Aster field: 1 (Sunflower to Aster)\n   - Update the distance and path to each neighboring field:\n     - Rose field: distance = 1, path = Sunflower\n     - Tulip field: distance = 1, path = Sunflower\n     - Daisy field: distance = 1, path = Sunflower\n     - Aster field: distance = 1, path = Sunflower\n   - Add the neighboring fields (Rose, Tulip, Daisy, and Aster) to the priority queue.\n7. Repeat the process until all fields have been visited.\n\nBased on the given graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from the Rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Sunflower, Aster, Pop"
