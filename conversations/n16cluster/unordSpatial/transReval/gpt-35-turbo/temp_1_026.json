The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We'll keep track of the total number of flowers collected at each field and the path taken to reach that field.\n\nWe start at the rose field and initialize the number of flowers collected at each field as follows:\n- rose field: 0 (since we haven't collected any flowers yet)\n- sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, and lily field: 1 (since we collect one rose at the rose field)\n\nWe then consider the neighboring fields of the rose field:\n- sunflower field: we can collect 1 sunflower\n- tulip field: we can collect 1 tulip\n- daisy field: we can collect 1 daisy\n- lily field: we can collect 1 lily\n\nAmong these neighboring fields, the lily field has the highest number of flowers (1 lily). So, we select the lily field as the next field in our path.\n\nNext, we consider the neighboring fields of the lily field:\n- rose field: we can collect 1 rose\n- peony field: we can collect 1 peony\n- hydrangea field: we can collect 1 hydrangea\n- orchid field: we can collect 1 orchid\n\nAmong these neighboring fields, the hydrangea field has the highest number of flowers (1 hydrangea). So, we select the hydrangea field as the next field in our path.\n\nWe continue this process until we reach a field where we can no longer collect more flowers or we have visited all fields. Considering the neighboring fields of each field and selecting the field with the highest number of flowers, we determine the following path and total number of flowers:\n\nrose field -> lily field -> hydrangea field -> orchid field -> tulip field -> daisy field -> zinnia field -> poppy field -> aster field\n\nTotal number of flowers: 1 rose + 1 lily + 1 hydrangea + 1 orchid + 1 tulip + 1 daisy + 1 zinnia = 7 flowers\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Hydrangea, Orchid, Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia"
