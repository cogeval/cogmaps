The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize the distances from the rose field to all other fields as infinity, except for the rose field itself which is 0.\n\n2. Create an empty set called visited to keep track of the fields we have visited.\n\n3. Create an empty dictionary called flower_counts to store the number of flowers we can collect from each field.\n\n4. Create a priority queue called pq and add the rose field with a distance of 0 to it.\n\n5. While pq is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Extract the field with the smallest distance from pq.\n   b. Add the extracted field to the visited set.\n   c. Update the flower_counts dictionary with the number of flowers we can collect from the extracted field.\n\n     - If the extracted field is the chrysanthemum field, set the number of chrysanthemum flowers to 50.\n     - If the extracted field is the lavender field, set the number of lavender flowers to 10.\n     - For all other fields, set the number of flowers to 0.\n\n   d. Iterate through the adjacent fields of the extracted field:\n      - If the adjacent field is not in the visited set and the distance from the extracted field plus 1 is smaller than the current distance to the adjacent field, update the distance and add the adjacent field to pq with the updated distance.\n\n6. After the algorithm finishes, we will have the shortest path from the rose field to all other fields and the number of flowers we can collect from each field.\n\n7. The path with the maximum number of flowers is the one with the shortest distance.
