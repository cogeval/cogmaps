The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the rose field, we can go to the sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, and lily field.\n\n2. From the sunflower field, we can go to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field. No flowers are available in the sunflower field.\n\n3. From the tulip field, we can go to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field. No flowers are available in the tulip field.\n\n4. From the daisy field, we can go to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. No flowers are available in the daisy field.\n\n5. From the lily field, we can go to the rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. No flowers are available in the lily field.\n\n6. From the orchid field, we can go to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. No flowers are available in the orchid field.\n\n7.

From the peony field, we can go to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. No flowers are available in the peony field.\n\n9. From the daffodil field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. No flowers are available in the daffodil field.\n\n10. From the chrysanthemum field, we can go to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. We can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free in the chrysanthemum field.\n\n11. From the carnation field, we can go to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. No flowers are available in the carnation field.\n\n12. From the marigold field, we can go to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. No flowers are available in the marigold field.\n\n13.

From the aster field, we can go to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.

From the rose field, we can still go to the sunflower field, but since it is no longer connected to the aster field, we cannot access the marigold field anymore.\n\n2. The lily field is blocked and cannot be reached from the rose field.\n\n3. Since the sunflower field is no longer connected to the aster field, there is no way to access the aster field from the rose field.\n\nGiven these changes, the only flower field we can reach from the rose field is the sunflower field.
