The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose -> Lily -> Hydrangea -> Peony -> Chrysanthemum (5 fields)\nFor lavender field:\n1. Rose -> Sunflower -> Aster -> Lavender (4 fields)\n\nNow, we have to decide whether we should go for the shorter path and get 10 lavender flowers or take the slightly longer path and get 50 chrysanthemum flowers. As the goal is to maximize the number of flowers, it makes more sense to choose the path leading to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Lily, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum"

Also, the daisy field is no longer connected to the zinnia field and, instead, the daisy field is now connected to the lily field. The path from the rose field to the lily field is blocked.

Rose -> Sunflower -> Marigold -> Daffodil -> Lavender (5 fields)\n\nNow, both paths have the same length (5 fields). However, as the goal is to maximize the number of flowers, it still makes more sense to choose the path leading to the chrysanthemum field since it offers 50 flowers, compared to the 10 flowers at the lavender field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Marigold, Carnation, Chrysanthemum"
