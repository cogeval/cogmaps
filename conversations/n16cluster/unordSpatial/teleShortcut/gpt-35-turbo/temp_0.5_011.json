The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's go through the given information step by step:\n\n1. The rose field is connected to the sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, and lily field.\n2. The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster field.\n3. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, and orchid field.\n4.

The lavender field is connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field.\n16. The aster field is connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can create a graph to visualize the relationships between the fields:\n\n```\nRose - Sunflower - Aster\n  |       |        |\n  |       |        |\nTulip - Daisy - Zinnia\n  |                |\n  |                |\nOrchid - Hydrangea - Marigold\n  |                |\n  |                |\nLily - Peony - Chrysanthemum\n  |\n  |\nDaffodil - Carnation\n  |\n  |\nPoppy\n  |\n  |\nLavender\n```\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. However, since we are only interested in the number of flowers, we can simplify the problem and find the field with the highest number of flowers connected to the rose field.\n\nBy analyzing the connections, we can see that the chrysanthemum field is connected to the rose field through the peony field. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is:\n\nRose - Peony - Chrysanthemum\n\nAnswer: Rose, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
