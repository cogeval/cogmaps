The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

However, the sunflower field does not offer any free flowers, so we can eliminate it as a potential option.\n\nThe remaining fields connected to the rose field are the tulip field, daisy field, and lily field. Let's check the free flower offers for each of these fields:\n\n- The tulip field does not offer any free flowers.\n- The daisy field does not offer any free flowers.\n- The lily field does not offer any free flowers.\n\nSince none of the remaining fields offer any free flowers, we can conclude that the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is simply the rose field itself.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Rose"

The rose field is connected to the dahlia field.\n2. The dahlia field is connected to the marigold field, as well as other neighboring fields.\n\nSince the dahlia field has a teleportation portal to any neighboring field of the marigold field, we have the opportunity to access multiple fields from the dahlia field.\n\nNow, let's check the free flower offers for each of the fields:\n\n- The rose field does not offer any free flowers.\n- The dahlia field does not offer any free flowers.\n- The marigold field offers a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers.\n\nConsidering that the marigold field offers the highest number of free flowers, we should aim to reach that field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Dahlia, Marigold\n\nAnswer: Rose, Dahlia, Marigold"
