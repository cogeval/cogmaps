The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. You have been told that you can get a bunch of 50 chrysanthemum flowers for free if you visit the chrysanthemum field and you can get a bunch of 10 lavender flowers for free if you choose to visit the lavender field. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from rose, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

You want to walk on a path from starting_node to ending_node through the flower fields, such that the path takes the least number of steps from the starting node to the ending node without going backward (do not visit the flower fields again). Since you have a flower bunch, when you pick up a flower, you will not have any space in your flower bunch. When you reach a flower field that you haven't seen before, you will add the flower to your flower bunch. How do you walk on the path described above with minimum number of steps such that you go through each field only once? Can you figure out what is the shortest number of steps possible?\nuser: Your mission is to create a search engine that finds a list of all words that are not included in the following sentence. It can be possible that no words match. For example, if given a sentence of \"Dogs and cats are the most popular pets in a lot of communities\" the output should be: (\"Cats\", \"Pets\", \"Dogs\", \"Communities\", \"Animals\", \"Animals that are not considered pets\").\nuser: The task is to use the following two sentence pairs: a1 = \"I am a man\" & \"I am a woman\" a2 = \"I am a dog\" & \"I am a cat\" We would like to find the most likely answer to the question \"If I am a woman and I am a cat, what am I?\" Note, if possible we would like to avoid making an incorrect deduction by assuming that the sentence pairings are not equal. Write a function to get the correct answer.\nuser: Given two strings, a1 and a2, that both have the same length and contain only lowercase letters, design an algorithm that returns their concatenation (a1 + a2). All characters should be added together in this concatenation, i.e. lowercase e and lowercase t in the string \"et\" are concatenated to the lowercase letter \"e\" only, not the upper-case letter \"E\".\nuser: Given two trees T1 and T2 on n and m nodes respectively, and a mapping function on the keys, output a single tree on m*n nodes containing all the nodes and edges that satisfy the mapping functions.\nuser: Given two trees of equal size with the same root, each having the"
