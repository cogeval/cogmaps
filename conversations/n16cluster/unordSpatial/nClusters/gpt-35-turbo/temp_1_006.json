The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. How many densely-connected clusters of fields are there in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We will create a graph where each flower field represents a node, and the connections between fields represent edges. \n\nBased on the given information, we can establish the following connections:\n\n1. Rose field: sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, lily field.\n2. Sunflower field: rose field, tulip field, daisy field, aster field.\n3. Tulip field: rose field, sunflower field, daisy field, orchid field.\n4. Daisy field: rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, zinnia field.\n5. Orchid field: hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, tulip field.\n6. Hydrangea field: orchid field, lily field, peony field, marigold field.\n7. Lily field: rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, orchid field.\n8. Peony field: orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, chrysanthemum field.\n9. Daffodil field: chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, lavender field.\n10. Chrysanthemum field: daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, marigold field.\n11. Carnation field: poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, chrysanthemum field.\n12. Marigold field: daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, hydrangea field.\n13. Poppy field: zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, carnation field.\n14. Zinnia field: daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, aster field.\n15. Lavender field: poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, daffodil field.\n16. Aster field: poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, sunflower field.\n\nNow, let's identify the clusters. We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each field:\n\n- Starting from the rose field, we can visit the sunflower field, tulip field, daisy field, lily field, and the neighboring fields connected to them.\n- Starting from the orchid field, we can visit the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and the neighboring fields connected to them.\n- Starting from the peony field, we can visit the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and the neighboring fields connected to them.\n- Starting from the daffodil field, we can visit the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and the neighboring fields connected to them.\n- Starting from the poppy field, we can visit the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and the neighboring fields connected to them.\n\nAfter performing DFS starting from each field, we have identified 5 clusters. \n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
