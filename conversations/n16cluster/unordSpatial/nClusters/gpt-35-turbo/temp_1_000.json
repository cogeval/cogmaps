Law school building is connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, health center, and gym. Computer science building is connected to rooms electrical engineering building, law school building , health center and Starbucks. Health center is also connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, law school buildings, and Yogurtland. Starbucks is connected to bioscience building, art library, student union building, and computer science building. Bioscience building is connected to Starbucks, art library, student union building, and KFC. Art library is connected to electrical engineering building, student union building, bioscience building, and Starbucks. Student union building is also connected to Starbucks, bioscience building, art library, and football stadium. Musical theater is connected to football stadium, swimming center, KFC, and science library. Football stadium is connected to musical theater, swimming center, student union building, and KFC.

We start with each unvisited building as a root and explore its neighbors until we find all buildings that are connected to the root. If there are no more unvisited buildings connected to the root, we mark the cluster as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nAfter applying the breadth-first search algorithm to the campus graph, we find that there are 6 densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Electrical engineering building, computer science building, health center, law school building\n2. Starbucks, art library, bioscience building, student union building\n3.
