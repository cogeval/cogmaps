The sunflower field is connected to the rose field, tulip field, daisy field, and aster fields. The tulip field is connected to the rose field, sunflower field, daisy field and orchid field. The daisy field is also connected to the rose field, sunflower field, tulip field, and zinnia field. The orchid field is connected to the hydrangea field, lily field, daffodil field, and tulip field. The hydrangea field is connected to the orchid field, lily field, peony field, and marigold field. The lily field is connected to rose field, peony field, hydrangea field, and orchid field. The peony field is also connected to the orchid field, hydrangea field, lily field, and chrysanthemum field. The daffodil field is connected to the chrysanthemum field, carnation field, marigold field, and lavender field. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the daffodil field, carnation field, peony field, and marigold field. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field, daffodil field, marigold field, and chrysanthemum field. The marigold field is also connected to the daffodil field, chrysanthemum field, carnation field, and hydrangea field. The poppy field is connected to the zinnia field, lavender field, aster field, and carnation field. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy field, poppy field, lavender field, and aster field. The lavender field is connected to poppy field, zinnia field, aster field, and daffodil field. The aster field is also connected to the poppy field, zinnia field, lavender field, and sunflower field. How many densely-connected clusters of fields are there in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We will start with the first field and traverse all the connected fields to form a cluster. Then, we will move on to the next unvisited field and repeat the process until all fields have been visited.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the number of densely-connected clusters:\n\n1. Initialize a list to keep track of visited fields and set the cluster count to 0.\n2. For each unvisited field, perform the following steps:\n   a. Start a depth-first search from the current field to find all connected fields in the cluster.\n   b. Mark each visited field as visited in the list.\n   c. Increment the cluster count by 1.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all fields have been visited.\n\nLet's go through these steps and calculate the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
