Law school building is connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, health center, and gym. Computer science building is connected to rooms electrical engineering building, law school building , health center and Starbucks. Health center is also connected to electrical engineering building, computer science building, law school buildings, and Yogurtland. Starbucks is connected to bioscience building, art library, student union building, and computer science building. Bioscience building is connected to Starbucks, art library, student union building, and KFC. Art library is connected to electrical engineering building, student union building, bioscience building, and Starbucks. Student union building is also connected to Starbucks, bioscience building, art library, and football stadium. Musical theater is connected to football stadium, swimming center, KFC, and science library. Football stadium is connected to musical theater, swimming center, student union building, and KFC. Swimming center is connected to Panda Express, musical theater, KFC, and football stadium. KFC is also connected to musical theater, football stadium, swimming center, and bioscience building. Panda Express is connected to Yogurtland, science library, gym, and swimming center. Yogurtland is connected to health center, Panda Express, science library and gym. Science library is connected to Panda Express, Yogurtland, gym, and musical theater. Gym is also connected to Panda Express, Yogurtland, science library, and law school building. How many densely-connected clusters of buildings are there in this university? A densely-connected cluster is a group of buildings that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 buildings."

Each building within the cluster should connect to a maximum of 2 buildings.\n\nCluster 1:\n- Electrical Engineering Building connects to 4 buildings (Law School, Computer Science, Health Center, and Art Library)\n- Law School Building connects to 4 buildings (Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Health Center, and Gym)\n- Computer Science Building connects to 4 buildings (Electrical Engineering, Law School, Health Center, and Starbucks)\n- Health Center connects to 4 buildings (Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Law School, and Yogurtland)\n- Art Library connects to 4 buildings (Electrical Engineering, Student Union, Bioscience, and Starbucks)\n- Starbucks connects to 4 buildings (Bioscience, Art Library, Student Union, and Computer Science)\n- Bioscience Building connects to 4 buildings (Starbucks, Art Library, Student Union, and KFC)\n- Student Union Building connects to 4 buildings (Starbucks, Bioscience, Art Library, and Football Stadium)\n\nCluster 2:\n- Musical Theater connects to 4 buildings (Football Stadium, Swimming Center, KFC, and Science Library)\n- Football Stadium connects to 4 buildings (Musical Theater, Swimming Center, Student Union, and KFC)\n- Swimming Center connects to 4 buildings (Panda Express, Musical Theater, KFC, and Football Stadium)\n- KFC connects to 4 buildings (Musical Theater, Football Stadium, Swimming Center, and Bioscience)\n- Science Library connects to 4 buildings (Panda Express, Yogurtland, Gym, and Musical Theater)\n- Panda Express connects to 4 buildings (Yogurtland, Science Library, Gym, and Swimming Center)\n- Yogurtland connects to 4 buildings (Health Center, Panda Express, Science Library, and Gym)\n- Gym connects to 4 buildings (Panda Express, Yogurtland, Science Library, and Law School)\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely connected clusters of buildings. As each building in both clusters connects to 4 buildings, neither cluster meets the condition of having a maximum of 2 connections. Therefore, there are no densely-connected clusters in this university.\n\nAnswer: there are 0 clusters"
