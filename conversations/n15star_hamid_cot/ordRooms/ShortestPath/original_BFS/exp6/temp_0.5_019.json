Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 11 to room 8? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Dequeue the first vertex in the queue.\n  b. If the dequeued vertex is the target vertex (room 8), stop the algorithm.\n  c. Otherwise, enqueue all the adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex that have not been visited yet and mark them as visited.\n\nStep 5: Reconstruct the path from the target vertex (room 8) to the starting vertex (room 11) by following the visited vertices.\n\nThe steps of the BFS algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Start at room 11.\n2. Enqueue room 11.\n3. Dequeue room 11 and enqueue its adjacent rooms (room 2 and room 5).\n4. Dequeue room 2 and enqueue its adjacent rooms (none, since room 11 and room 5 have already been visited).\n5. Dequeue room 5 and enqueue its adjacent rooms (room 8).\n6. Dequeue room 8, which is the target vertex.\n\nNow, reconstruct the path:\n\n1. Room 8 was reached from room 5.\n2. Room 5 was reached from room 11.\n\nSo, the shortest path from room 11 to room 8 is: 11, 5, 8. \n\nAnswer: 11, 5, 8"
