Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 11 to room 8? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Also, create a dictionary to store the path for each room visited.\n\nStep 3: While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n\n  Step 3.1: Dequeue the front element from the queue and store it in a variable, current_room.\n\n  Step 3.2: Check if current_room is equal to the target point (room 8). If yes, we have found the shortest path, so stop.\n\n  Step 3.3: If current_room is not equal to the target point (room 8), get the connected rooms of the current_room and loop through them. For each connected room, add the room to the queue and update the path in the dictionary, only if it hasn't been visited before.\n\nStep 4: Once the shortest path has been found, print the path.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\nStep 1: Starting point: room 11, Target point: room 8\n\nStep 2: Queue = [11], Path dictionary = {11: [11]}\n\nStep 3: Queue is not empty\n\n  Step 3.1: current_room = 11\n\n  Step 3.2: current_room is not equal to room 8\n\n  Step 3.3: Connected rooms of room 11 are [7, 5, 14].
