Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 11 to room 8? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Depth-first search (DFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In DFS, the algorithm traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses a stack data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that all vertices connected to a visited vertex are explored before backtracking. DFS is useful for finding cycles in a graph, for exploring all the vertices in a graph, or for finding a path between two vertices. However, unlike BFS, DFS does not guarantee that the shortest path is found.|endofprompt|"

In this case, room 11 is the starting point, and room 8 is the destination point.\n\nStep 2: Initialize the DFS algorithm. Create an empty stack and a visited list to keep track of the visited rooms.\n\nStep 3: Push the starting point (room 11) onto the stack and mark it as visited.\n\nStep 4: Check the adjacent rooms of the current room (room 11). Rooms 1, 2, 5, and 14 are connected to room 11.\n\nStep 5: Push the first unvisited adjacent room (room 1) onto the stack and mark it as visited.\n\nStep 6: Check the adjacent rooms of the current room (room 1). Rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11 are connected to room 1.\n\nStep 7: Since all adjacent rooms of room 1 have been visited, backtrack to room 11 and pop room 1 from the stack.\n\nStep 8: Push the next unvisited adjacent room (room 2) onto the stack and mark it as visited.\n\nStep 9: Check the adjacent rooms of the current room (room 2).
