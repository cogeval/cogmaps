Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

The adjacent rooms are room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11.\nStep 4: Continue visiting adjacent rooms of the next layer, considering the connections of each room, avoiding revisiting any rooms.\nStep 5: Visit the adjacent rooms of room 7 (room 1, room 4, room 10, room 13) - all visited or already in the queue. Move to room 10 (room 1, room 7, room 13, room 4) - all visited or already in the queue. Move to room 13 (room 1, room 7, room 10, room 4) - all visited or already in the queue. Move to room 11 (room 1, room 2, room 5, room 8, room 14) - add room 2, room 5, room 8, room 14 to the queue.\nStep 6: Visit the adjacent rooms of room 2 (room 5, room 8, room 11, room 14) - all visited or already in the queue.
