Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other.

Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Dequeue the front vertex (current room) from the queue.\n  b. Check if the current room is room 12. If yes, the path is found.\n  c. If not, enqueue all connected rooms that have not been visited yet and mark them as visited.\nStep 6: If the path is found, backtrack from room 12 to room 1, keeping track of the rooms visited.\n\nFollowing the BFS algorithm:\n\n1. Room 1 is the source vertex.\n2. Add room 1 to the queue.\n3. Dequeue room 1 and check its connected rooms (room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 11).\n4. Enqueue rooms 7, 10, 13, and 11.\n5.

Dequeue room 9 and check its connected rooms (room 6, room 3, and room 12).\n28. Room 12 is already visited, so skip it. Rooms 6 and 3 are already in the queue, so skip them.\n29. Dequeue room 12, which is our destination. Path found.\n\nBacktrack from room 12 to room 1:\n- Room 12 is connected to room 15.\n- Room 15 is connected to room 13.\n- Room 13 is connected to room 1.\n\nSo, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is 1, 13, 15, 12. \n\nAnswer: 1, 13, 15, 12"
