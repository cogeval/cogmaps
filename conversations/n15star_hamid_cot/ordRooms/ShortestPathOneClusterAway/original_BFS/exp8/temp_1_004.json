Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\nStep 5: Dequeue room 7 and explore its connected rooms. It is connected to 1, 4, 10, and 13. Rooms 1, 10, and 13 are already visited, so we add room 4 to the queue.\nStep 6: Dequeue room 10 and explore its connected rooms. It is connected to 1, 7, 13, and 4. All of them are already visited.\nStep 7: Dequeue room 11 and explore its connected rooms. It is connected to 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14. Rooms 1 and 8 have already been visited, so we add rooms 2, 5, and 14 to the queue.\nStep 8: Dequeue room 13 and explore its connected rooms. It is connected to 1, 7, 10, and 4.

Rooms 2, 5, 8, and 11 have already been visited, so we add room 12 to the queue.\nStep 13: Since we have found room 12, stop the BFS and traceback the path from room 12.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1 -> 11 -> 14 -> 12\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 12"
