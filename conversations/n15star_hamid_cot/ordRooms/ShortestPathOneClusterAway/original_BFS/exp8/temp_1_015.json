Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

If not, proceed to Step 7.\nStep 7: Dequeue the first room from the queue and identify it as the current room.\nStep 8: Check if the current room is the target room (room 12). If yes, end the BFS loop and output the path. If not, proceed to Step 9.\nStep 9: Iterate through the adjacent rooms of the current room. For each adjacent room, check if it has been visited (i.e., if it has a path in the dictionary). If not, update the path for the adjacent room by appending it to the current room's path and add the adjacent room to the queue.\nStep 10: Repeat Steps 6 to 9 until the queue is empty or the target room has been visited.\n\nApplying the above steps, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 10, 13, 15, 12"
