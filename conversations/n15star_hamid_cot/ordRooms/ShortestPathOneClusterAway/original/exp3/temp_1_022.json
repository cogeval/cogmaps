Room 1 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 11, and 13.\nStep 3: Check each connected room's connections and find the shortest path to room 12. \n\n- Room 7 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 10, and 13. No direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 10 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 7, and 13. No direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 11 is connected to rooms 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14. No direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 13 is connected to rooms 1, 4, 7, and 10. No direct connection to room 12.\n\nStep 4: Since none of these rooms have a direct connection to room 12, we'll have to check their connections for any connection to room 12.\n\n- Room 7's connection, room 4, is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15. No direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 10's connection, room 4, also has no direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 11's connection, room 2, is connected to rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14. No direct connection to room 12.\n- Room 13's connection, room 4, also has no direct connection to room 12.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the next level of connections. \n\n- Room 4's connection, room 15, is connected to rooms 4, 6, 9, and 12. Room 12 is directly connected.\n\nStep 6: Trace the path back from room 12 to room 1.\n\n- Room 12 is connected to room 15.\n- Room 15 is connected to room 4.\n- Room 4 is connected to room 7.\n- Room 7 is connected to room 1.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 15, 12"
