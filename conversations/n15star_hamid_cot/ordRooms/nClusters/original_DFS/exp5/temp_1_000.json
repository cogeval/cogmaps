Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Depth-first search (DFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In DFS, the algorithm traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses a stack data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that all vertices connected to a visited vertex are explored before backtracking. DFS is useful for finding cycles in a graph, for exploring all the vertices in a graph, or for finding a path between two vertices. However, unlike BFS, DFS does not guarantee that the shortest path is found.|endofprompt|"

Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited rooms and a counter to count the number of densely-connected clusters.\n2. Start with room 1, perform DFS on the castle's layout.\n3. Each time a room is visited, add it to the visited set.\n4. After completing the DFS for a room, increment the counter for clusters.\n5. Continue to the next unvisited room in numerical order and perform DFS.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all the rooms have been visited.\n\nStep 3: Execute the DFS and count the number of clusters.\n- DFS starting from room 1 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13\n- Increment counter to 1.\n- DFS starting from room 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 14\n- Increment counter to 2.\n- DFS starting from room 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 15\n- Increment counter to 3.\n- Room 4, already visited.\n- Room 5, already visited.\n- Room 6, already visited.\n- Room 7, already visited.\n- Room 8, already visited.\n- Room 9, already visited.\n- Room 10, already visited.\n- Room 11, already visited.\n- Room 12, already visited.\n- Room 13, already visited.\n- Room 14, already visited.\n- Room 15, already visited.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final outcome based on the counter value.\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
