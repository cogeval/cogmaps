Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Merge them into a single cluster: Room 1, Room 7, Room 10, Room 13, Room 11, and Room 15.\n- Clusters 2 and 5 overlap with rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14. Merge them into a single cluster: Room 2, Room 5, Room 8, Room 11, and Room 14.\n- Cluster 3 and 6 overlap with rooms 6, 9, and 12. Merge them into a single cluster: Room 3, Room 6, Room 9, Room 12, and Room 8.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected room clusters.\nThere are now 3 densely-connected room clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
