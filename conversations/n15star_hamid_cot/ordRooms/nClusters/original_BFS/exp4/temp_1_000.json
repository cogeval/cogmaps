Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

If the room hasn't been visited yet, we perform the BFS algorithm.\n\nStep 5: BFS algorithm.\nWhile performing BFS, we start with the current room, visit all its connected rooms, and mark them as visited. We also maintain a queue to keep track of the rooms to be explored.\n\nStep 6: Increment cluster counter.\nAfter BFS is completed for a room, we can increment the cluster counter.\n\nStep 7: Continue BFS for other rooms.\nWe perform the BFS for all other rooms (if any) that have not been visited, and increment the cluster counter accordingly.\n\nStep 8: Determine the number of densely connected room clusters.\nAfter completing BFS for all rooms, we will have the number of clusters in the castle.\n\nFinal outcome:"
