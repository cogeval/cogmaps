Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Add them to the visited list and queue.\nVisited: [1, 7, 10, 13, 11]\nQueue: [7, 10, 13, 11]\n\nStep 4: Apply BFS for each room in the queue until it's empty\n- For room 7: connected to 10, 13.

Already in the visited list, no changes.\n- For room 13: no connections to new rooms.\n- For room 11: connected to 14. Add 14 to visited list and queue.\nVisited: [1, 7, 10, 13, 11, 14]\nQueue: [14]\n\nStep 5: Continue BFS for room 14\n- For room 14: no connections to new rooms.\n\nStep 6: Since the queue is empty, this marks the end of the first cluster. Initialize a new queue and visited list for the remaining rooms.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 3-5 for the remaining rooms\nWe start with room 2:\nVisited: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]\nQueue: [5, 8, 11, 14]\nBFS for rooms in the queue:\n- For room 5: connected to 8, 11, 14. All are already in the visited list, no changes.\n- For room 8: connected to 14. Already in the visited list, no changes.\n- For room 11: Already visited in the first cluster, no changes.\n- For room 14: Already visited in the first cluster, no changes.\n\nStep 8: No new clusters are formed in the second iteration, so there is no need to continue further.\n\nAnswer: there are 2 clusters"
