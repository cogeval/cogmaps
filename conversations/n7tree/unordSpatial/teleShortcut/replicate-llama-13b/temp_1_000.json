This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

But the United Airlines flight from San Diego to Denver is delayed to your flight to San Diego. How long would it take you if this flight was not delayed?</p>\n<p id=\"20090311-answer-01\">Assume the difference between the departure time for flight 1 and the arrival time for flight 2 is 2 hours. Then the difference between the departure time for flight 2 and the arrival time for flight 3 is 2 hours. The departure of flight 1 is 5 hours ago, and the flight is currently at the gate waiting for boarding passengers. The flight time from San Diego to Denver is 2 hours, so departure time of flight 3 is 5 hours from now. You have to wait for flight 3 for 2 hours. Thus, you would reach home on Monday at around 8:30 PM.</p>"
