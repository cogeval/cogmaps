You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

We know the lily field has a portal to any neighboring field of the rose field, so we can access the daisy and tulip fields from there.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum number of flowers we can get from the lily field and its portal.\n- Lily field + Daisy field: Unknown + 22\n- Lily field + Tulip field: Unknown + 56\n\nStep 5: Since the number of flowers in the lily field is unknown, we can't determine the exact total for each path. However, we can make a decision based on the available information.\n\n- If the lily field has more than 4 flowers, Path 3 (Lily field, Tulip field) will have more than 60 flowers, making it the best choice.\n- If the lily field has 4 or fewer flowers, Path 1 (Sunflower field, Hydrangea field, Orchid field) will still have the maximum number of flowers.\n\nStep 6: Provide the final outcome with the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas.\nAnswer: Entrance, Lily field, Tulip field"
