You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

I'll leave the implementation of that to you.\n\nNow that we have an AI Assistant to help us with our problems, let's explore what we can do with it. In the next article, we will explore using the AI Assistant to build a search engine.\n\nWe want to learn how to build a search engine. Let's say we have two websites, the IMD (Internet Movie Database) and Stack Overflow.\n\nA search engine takes a query and returns a list of results that match the query. For example, if we search for \"Anakin Skywalker\", we expect to get results for \"Darth Vader\".\nAs a second example, if we search for \"CSS framework\", we expect to get results for \"Bootstrap\" and \"Foundation\".\n\nTo implement this, we will first look at a naive approach and then a more efficient approach using caching.\n\nNote: In the rest of this article, I will use \"search engine\" and \"searching\" interchangeably. We will build a search engine for IMDB and Stack Overflow, but you can build a search engine for any website.\n\nOur naive approach will"
