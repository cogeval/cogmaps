You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

You cannot pick those two flowers concurrently since they're from different groups so you choose Daisy field. The path to a Daisy and a Lily leads away from the entrance so if you go back for a path that maximized for roses and Orchids will be blocked so your answer is only one path for now but it should give the biggest flow probability. The one remaining unknown field is the Lily field from the new path. In other words the neighbor field from a lily field is in reality. From here going one by one the maximum flow order is from a ros/orhi/daisy (this is already blocked as indicated),then from an entrance daise is blocked with neighboring orch/lis field with portal and can reach other field through this portalling of lily/orbis,tuls/hip. So to get the MAXIMIUM Flow from daisy ros/orp is through lyl field. Hopefully."
