You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

Starting from the entrance, if you go to the right, you will enter the sunflower field.\n2. From the sunflower field, if you go to the right again, you will enter the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n3. Returning to the sunflower field, if you go to the left, you will enter the orchid field with 10 orchid flowers.\n4. Returning to the entrance, if you go to the left, you will enter the rose field.\n5. From the rose field, if you go to the right, you will enter the daisy field with 22 daisy flowers.\n6. Returning to the rose field, if you go to the left, you will enter the tulip field with 56 tulip flowers.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, the path to take would be: Entrance, Sunflower field (Right), Hydrangea field, Rose field (Right), Daisy field, Tulip field.\n\nTherefore, the path with the maximum number of flowers is: Entrance, Sunflower field (Right), Hydrangea field, Rose field (Right), Daisy field, Tulip field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Sunflower field, Hydrangea field, Rose field, Daisy field, Tulip field."

From the lily field, you can use the portal to access any neighboring field of the rose field.\n3. As the previous path that led to the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to find an alternative path.\n\nTo maximize the number of flowers, we need to explore other options. Let's consider the remaining unexplored fields:\n\n1. Sunflower field (Left): This field was not previously visited. We don't know how many flowers are there.\n2. Orchid field: This field has 10 orchid flowers.\n3. Rose field (Left): This field leads to the tulip field with 56 tulip flowers.\n\nComparing these options, the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by choosing the path that leads to the tulip field with 56 tulip flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path with the maximum number of flowers from the entrance, considering the new field and the portal, is: Entrance, Rose field (Left), Tulip field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Rose field, Tulip field."
