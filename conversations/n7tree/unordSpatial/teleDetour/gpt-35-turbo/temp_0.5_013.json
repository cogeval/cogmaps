You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

From the entrance, you can choose to go to the right or left. Since the right path only leads to the sunflower field, which does not have any flowers available for collection, it is better to choose the left path.\n\n2. After entering the orchid field, you find 10 orchid flowers for free. Remembering that you can only pick one path to collect flowers, it is best to continue exploring.\n\n3. In the rose field, you have two options: left or right. Since the right path leads to the daisy field where you can collect 22 daisy flowers, it is better to choose the right path.\n\n4. After collecting the daisy flowers, you go back to the rose field. This time, choose the left path to enter the tulip field.\n\n5. In the tulip field, you find 56 tulip flowers for free, but since you can only pick one path to collect flowers, it is better to continue exploring.\n\n6. Finally, you go back to the entrance, which concludes your exploration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers is: Entrance, Rose Field (Right), Daisy Field, Rose Field (Left), Tulip Field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Rose Field, Tulip Field"

However, since it is mentioned that the path that previously led to the maximum number of flowers is now blocked, we need to explore other options.\n\n2. We know that the previous path was: Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Rose Field, Tulip Field. Since we cannot take that path anymore, we need to consider alternative paths.\n\n3. Since the lily field has a portal that allows you to go to any neighboring field of the rose field, we can utilize this to our advantage.\n\n4. From the entrance, we can go to the right path that leads to the sunflower field. However, since there are no flowers available for collection in the sunflower field, it is not the optimal choice.\n\n5. Therefore, we should choose the left path from the entrance, which leads to the orchid field.\n\n6. From the orchid field, we can go to the rose field via the lily field portal. This allows us to access the neighboring fields of the rose field.\n\n7. In the rose field, we have two options: left or right. Since the right path leads to the daisy field where we can collect 22 daisy flowers, it is the better choice.\n\n8. After collecting the daisy flowers, we go back to the rose field. This time, choose the left path to enter the tulip field.\n\n9. In the tulip field, we find 56 tulip flowers for free, but since we can only pick one path to collect flowers, it is better to continue exploring.\n\n10. Finally, we go back to the entrance, which concludes our exploration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the new path that allows us to collect the maximum number of flowers is: Entrance, Orchid Field, Rose Field (Right), Daisy Field, Rose Field (Left), Tulip Field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Orchid Field, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Rose Field, Tulip Field"
