You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

Left field in the sunflower field (orchid field): 10 orchid flowers.\n6. Right field in the hydrangea field: 50 hydrangea flowers.\n7. Left field in the orchid field: No flowers.\n8. Right field in the rose field (daisy field): 22 daisy flowers.\n9. Left field in the rose field (tulip field): 56 tulip flowers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nEntrance, Left field in the sunflower field (orchid field), Right field in the hydrangea field, Right field in the rose field (daisy field), Left field in the rose field (tulip field).\n\nTherefore, the order of flower names in this path, including the entrance, separated by commas, is:\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Orchid, Hydrangea, Daisy, Tulip"

Let's analyze the number of flowers in each field:\n\n1. Entrance: No flowers.\n2. New field (lily field): Unknown number of flowers.\n3. Portal from the lily field to any neighboring field of the rose field: Unknown number of flowers.\n4. Right field in the rose field (daisy field): 22 daisy flowers.\n5. Left field in the rose field (tulip field): 56 tulip flowers.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the flowers in the lily field and the neighboring fields of the rose field. Since we don't have information about the number of flowers in the lily field or the neighboring fields, we cannot determine the exact path to maximize the number of flowers.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the lily field and the neighboring fields have the same number of flowers as before, the previous path that led to the maximum number of flowers would be:\n\nEntrance, Left field in the sunflower field (orchid field), Right field in the hydrangea field, Right field in the rose field (daisy field), Left field in the rose field (tulip field).\n\nTherefore, if we make this assumption, the order of flower names in this path, including the entrance, separated by commas, would be:\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Orchid, Hydrangea, Daisy, Tulip"
