Do you know how to tackle those cases?\n#artificial_intelligence\n#task_2\nThis task has to be solved without the help of any library for NLP or text processing. Your task is to build an automated assistant, who will do the tasks, given by the user. You will not get any further input. The only input you will receive will be as following:\nuser: You are visiting Disneyland. You hit the entrance and you see two passages, one on the right and one on the left. You choose the passage on the right and enter Tomorrowland. You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas.\nGot it, I'll take a crack at this.\nI made a parser for this using Python's nltk library. I think the solution is as follows:\npath = 'Mad Tea Party';\n# get the shortest wait time for the path\nshortest = list(path.find('wait_time'))[0]\n# get the attractions in the path\nattractions = list(path.findall('attraction'))\n# compare the wait time for each attraction in the path\nattractions.sort(key=lambda attraction: float(attraction[shortest]))\nattractions[0]  # list the results\n#"

When you return to entrance and choose the path that led to the shortest wait time previously, you discover that the passage from Fantasyland to Mad Tea Party is now blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one attraction with the least wait time. From the entrance, where should you go to for the shortest wait time?

Instead, I'd use a \"State Machine\" approach.\nI won't go much into detail, as this is a common problem.\nIn essence, it consists of a start node (the question). From that start node you need to enter your state machine, which will have an \"accept\" node and a \"reject\" node. The accept node is reached when the correct answer is given (here, the path you'd walk to minimize wait time). In that case you'll hit the accept node. Otherwise, you'll hit the reject node, with its correct answer(s) (here, paths that do not work for the wait time).\nThen you can do whatever logic you need and finally, reach back to the start node and either take the path or reject the path, as this is where the user asks their question.\nI think this is more clean and easier to understand.\nanswer: Tomorrowland\nanswer: Fantasyland\nThe main point with AI assistants is the clean, predictable feedback.
