You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

Then, given the limited time, which path should I choose? I think about the wait time only. Since I know that Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes, I can choose.\nBrian C: I'm confused on what the final output should be. How can I identify that my user chose the correct path if they never actually said which path they chose?\nuser: My bot said \"Autopia, Space Mountain\". That is my answer."
