Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas.\nAutopia has a wait time of exactly 20 minutes and Space Mountain has a wait time of exactly 10 minutes. The first two time durations are equal. We have a set of two numbers, A and B, and we are to find out the minimum of these two.\nIf A is less than B, then the desired answer is A.\nIf A is equal to B, then the desired answer is B.\nIf A is greater than B, then the desired answer is B.\nIn our case, the two durations are 20 and 10 minutes. A is the minimum duration, and the answer is 20.\nFor our solution, we will first assume that the given statement is valid. If the given statement is invalid, then we will return an answer different than the given answer, which implies that our solution will be incorrect.\nAssume that the given statement is valid and that we have"
