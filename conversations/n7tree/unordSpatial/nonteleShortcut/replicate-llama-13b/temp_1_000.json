Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only.

How would you make an Artificial Intelligence agent, given the following tasks:\n* The following three sentences are all the same \"I'm thinking about going to Disneyland\" \"I'm thinking about going to Disney World\" \"I'm thinking about going to Europa Park\". As an intelligence you need to know, which sentence, if any, are true.\n* I wake up in a bathtub full of water. Imagine this as an intelligence. Based on the following sentences: I drink the water out. I get out of the bathtub. I turn off water from the faucet. I open the drain and let the water out. I turn my head to the left. I turn my head to the right. I feel a big pain in my head I scream and cry. I see a lot of water coming up from the drain. I see a lot of water from the bathtub. I see my bed on top of a table. I feel a lot better. I see a big white wall in front of me I feel dizzy when I look at it I see a brown carpet on the wall. I see a red light on the carpet. I see water going up in a big blue line all the time. I find the red light and turn it off I feel a sharp pain I remember I am wet, so I dry myself up. I turn the tap on again (for drying up the bathtub). I get inside the bathtub again I pour my clothes in the washing machine What would an intelligence do from here? How could it tell what is the right next step?\n* Imagine this as an Intelligence: You are in a room with three walls at random angles. You observe some random events, for instance one of them is: you see a mouse go out of the window. Given these events, How do you decide if there is a mouse in the room?\n* You're a small robotic AI working on a farm. The farmer comes over and says, \"You are in the middle of a field. You can either go to the left or right. Go whichever way will make it the most profitable (by your measure) without exceeding half the money the farmer provided you at setup.\" You turn around to inspect your surroundings. The left wall is one foot higher than the right wall, and 10 meters"
