You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

For the second attraction that you will go to, include that path only if you intend to go there regardless of the wait time that you have left for that second attraction.\nThis is your third task. Remember to use regexps like 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+'.\nIf your answer does not follow this regexp format, your answer will not be graded. That means if you have any letters, spaces, new lines, tabs, or anything else, you will receive 0 points. If your final output is not a string of numbers, your output will not be graded. Therefore, be sure to test whether your output is valid. A valid output must be '5,6,8,4,10'.\nYour final output must match. This means that if you have an unmatched quote in there, or anything else, your answer will not receive any points!\nYou can assume that each step of the question will start with \"You are at the Entrance...\" and will end with \"Your response must be correct to receive a grade.\"\nNote: If the test takers were to run the code that generates the image above, then the code would correctly return 5,6,8,4,10.\nYou should try to provide the minimum answer that will match the test taker's desired result. For example, if the test taker said, \"You can go in any direction. You will always get through by choosing an appropriate way\", then the output would still be 5,6,8,4,10 just because the only possible choice that would match the constraints set out by the tester would be to always enter \"Left\". However, if you think that 4,10,5,6,8 is the minimum answer that will return, then that is fine! As long as 4 of the steps in the image are correct, the grading system will consider your answer to the task correct.\nTask 1: You should always enter \"Left\" if you are at the Entrance.\nTask 2: You must always enter \"Up, Up\".\nTask"
