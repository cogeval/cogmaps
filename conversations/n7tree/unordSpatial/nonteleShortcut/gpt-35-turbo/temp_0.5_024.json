You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

Left field (Orchid field) - 10 orchid flowers\n6. Return to Entrance\n7. Left field (Rose field)\n8. Right field (Daisy field) - 22 daisy flowers\n9. Return to Rose field\n10. Left field (Tulip field) - 56 tulip flowers\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of flowers for each path:\n\nPath 1: Sunflower field (50 hydrangea flowers) -> Orchid field (10 orchid flowers) -> Daisy field (22 daisy flowers) -> Tulip field (56 tulip flowers)\nTotal flowers: 50 + 10 + 22 + 56 = 138\n\nPath 2: Sunflower field (50 hydrangea flowers) -> Orchid field (10 orchid flowers) -> Rose field -> Daisy field (22 daisy flowers) -> Tulip field (56 tulip flowers)\nTotal flowers: 50 + 10 + 22 + 56 = 138\n\nPath 3: Sunflower field (50 hydrangea flowers) -> Rose field -> Daisy field (22 daisy flowers) -> Tulip field (56 tulip flowers)\nTotal flowers: 50 + 22 + 56 = 128\n\nPath 4: Sunflower field (50 hydrangea flowers) -> Rose field -> Tulip field (56 tulip flowers)\nTotal flowers: 50 + 56 = 106\n\nTherefore, the path that allows us to collect the maximum number of flowers is Path 1: Sunflower field, Orchid field, Daisy field, Tulip field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Sunflower field, Orchid field, Daisy field, Tulip field"
