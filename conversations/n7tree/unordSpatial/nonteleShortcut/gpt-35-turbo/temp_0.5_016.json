You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

From the entrance, we have two options: the field on the right and the field on the left.\n2. Choosing the field on the right takes us to the sunflower field, but we don't collect any flowers there.\n3. Going back to the sunflower field, this time we choose the field on the left, which leads us to the orchid field. Again, we don't collect any flowers.\n4. Returning to the entrance, we now choose the field on the left. This takes us to the rose field.\n5. In the rose field, we have two options: the field on the left and the field on the right.\n6. Choosing the field on the right leads us to the daisy field, where we find 22 daisy flowers.\n7. Going back to the rose field, this time we choose the field on the left, which takes us to the tulip field. Again, we don't collect any flowers.\n8.

If we choose the field on the right, we will follow the previous path: Sunflower Field, Orchid Field (without collecting any flowers).\n3. If we choose the field on the left, we enter the Rose Field.\n4. In the Rose Field, we have two options: the field on the left and the field on the right.\n5. If we choose the field on the right, we will follow the previous path: Daisy Field (with 22 daisy flowers).\n6. If we choose the field on the left, we will enter a neighboring zone of the Rose Field.\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of flowers, we should choose the field on the left in the Rose Field to explore the neighboring zone. However, since we don't know the specific flower field in that neighboring zone, we cannot determine the exact number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, starting from and including the entrance, is:\n\nEntrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field (with 22 daisy flowers).\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field."
