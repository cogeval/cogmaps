You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

However, we didn't find any flowers there, so we go back.\n\nNext, we choose the field on the left, which leads us to the orchid field. We find 10 orchid flowers, but since we can only choose one path to collect flowers, we continue to explore.\n\nReturning to the entrance, we now choose the field on the left. This leads us to the rose field, where we have two options again.\n\nWe choose the field on the right, leading us to the daisy field. Here, we find 22 daisy flowers. We still have one more field to explore, so we go back to the rose field.\n\nFinally, we choose the field on the left, which takes us to the tulip field. We find 56 tulip flowers there.\n\nBased on this exploration, the path that allows us to collect the maximum number of flowers is: Entrance, Orchid Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Orchid Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field"

Entrance, Rose Field: This is the path that we have already explored, where we found 22 daisy flowers. \n\n2. Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field: This is the same path as before, where we found 22 daisy flowers. \n\n3. Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field: This path includes the same path as before (Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field), and adds the Tulip Field, where we found 56 tulip flowers. \n\nComparing the routes, we can see that the third route, Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field, leads to the maximum number of flowers, with a total of 22 + 56 = 78 flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that will lead to the maximum number of flowers, starting from and including the entrance, is: Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Rose Field, Daisy Field, Tulip Field."
