You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

Note the 'Answer:' line and the 'Path to attraction' line.\n\nNext, we will see how to validate the results of the AI assistant. Remember that the task was to provide the shortest wait time from the Entrance. However, the AI assistant gave the shortest wait time for Autopia. It does not make sense to go to Autopia from the Entrance, as it will take longer to get there. Let's validate the results using a regular expression.\n\nAgain, we use a regular expression to validate the results. You should see the following output. The first line is the 'Answer:' line, and the second line is the validation message.\n\nRegular expressions are extremely useful to validate the output of an AI assistant. You can use the same regular expression for different scenarios. For example, if the shortest wait time for Space Mountain from the Entrance is 1 minute, the output should be \"Space Mountain\". Similarly, if the shortest wait time for Mad Tea Party from the Entrance is 5 minutes, the output should be \"Mad Tea Party\".\n\nThe next challenge is to build a larger and more complicated regular expression to validate the output of the AI assistant"
