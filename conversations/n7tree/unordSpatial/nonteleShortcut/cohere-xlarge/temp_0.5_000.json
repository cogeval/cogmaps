You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

The fields you can choose from are the sunflower, hydrangea, orchid, rose, daisy, and tulip fields. Each field has a different number of flowers. To get the maximum number of flowers, you would have to collect flowers from the sunflower, hydrangea, orchid, and rose fields. The total number of flowers would be 50 + 10 + 22 + 56 = 128.\n\nThe first flower field is the sunflower field, which has 50 sunflower flowers. The second flower field is the hydrangea field, which has 10 hydrangea flowers. The third flower field is the orchid field, which has 22 orchid flowers. The fourth flower field is the rose field, which has 56 rose flowers. The fifth flower field is the daisy field, which has 22 daisy flowers. The sixth flower field is the tulip field, which has 56 tulip flowers.\n\nYou can collect a maximum of 128 flowers by going to the sunflower, hydrangea, orchid, rose, daisy, and tulip fields in that order."
