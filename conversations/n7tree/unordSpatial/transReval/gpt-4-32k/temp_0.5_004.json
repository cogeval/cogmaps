This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."
