You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

Let's go step by step:\n\n1. From the entrance, you choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. No flowers are taken at this point.\n\n2. From the sunflower field, you choose the field on the right and enter the hydrangea field. You find 50 hydrangea flowers, but you don't take any.\n\n3. You go back to the sunflower field and choose the field on the left to the orchid field. You find 10 orchid flowers, but again, you don't take any.\n\n4. You go back to the entrance and this time choose the field on the left to the rose field.\n\n5. From the rose field, you choose the field on the right and enter the daisy field. You find 22 daisy flowers, but you still don't take any.\n\n6. You go back to the rose field and choose the field on the left to the tulip field. In the tulip field, you find 56 tulip flowers, but you don't take any.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of flowers in each field:\n\n- Sunflower field: 0 flowers\n- Hydrangea field: 50 flowers\n- Orchid field: 10 flowers\n- Rose field: 0 flowers\n- Daisy field: 22 flowers\n- Tulip field: 56 flowers\n\nBased on the number of flowers in each field, the maximum number of flowers can be found in the Tulip field. Therefore, the path to collect the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nEntrance, Rose field, Tulip field\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Rose field, Tulip field"

Another person comes back from the sunflower field and says the orchid field on the left leads to 60 orchid flowers for free and the hydrangea field on the right leads to 20 hydrangea flowers.

From the entrance, the person coming back from the sunflower field states that the orchid field on the left has 60 orchid flowers for free, while the person from the sunflower field says the hydrangea field on the right has 20 hydrangea flowers.\n\n2. Considering the new information, we revise the options:\n\n- Sunflower field (right): 20 hydrangea flowers\n- Orchid field (left): 60 orchid flowers\n\n3. Let's evaluate the other fields as well:\n\n- Rose field: Daisy field (left) has 40 daisy flowers\n- Daisy field: Tulip field (right) has 30 tulip flowers\n\nBased on this updated information, the path to collect the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nEntrance, Sunflower field, Orchid field, Rose field, Daisy field\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, including the entrance, are:\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Sunflower field, Orchid field, Rose field, Daisy field"
