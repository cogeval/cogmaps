You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

You are visiting a coffee farm and you are wondering how to transport coffee beans out of the fields. You have three options: (1) A donkey cart can do 94 miles per day at an average speed of 20mph. (2) A trailer can do 112 miles per day at an average speedof 7mph. Or (3) a pickup truck can do 78 miles per day at an average speed of 50mph. Which of these would get you to the port the fastest while at the same time meeting the target of 96 miles to the port? The maximum distance is 160 miles from the coffee farm to the port, so this is your target. Include the pickup route in the answer.

Then provide your final outcome following the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z-]' The user: The cost of a product manufactured at a factory in year 2018 is calculated as follows: (1) Variable Cost = 221.3*F *M, (2) Variable Cost = 221.3*F *M, (3) Variable Cost = 221.3*F *M. In year 2017 the cost of a product manufactured at a factory before its new machines are set up is 220*(F-M+30)/(90-M)*G, where F, G, and M are factory factors. F, G, and M are assumed to increase by 10% year on year. In year"

Then provide your final outcome following the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z-]' The user: You have to choose from three options 1. The fastest option is to walk from the entrance to the entrance of Space Mountain at a speed of 2mph.\n2. A penguin can swim at a speed of 3mph, with a speed limit of 1mph per day. How long does it take the penguin to reach the entrance of Space Mountain? The distance is 294 miles. 3. You go back to the original entrance. The only way to the entrance of Space Mountain is via Tomorrowland, where there's a passage from one of the other two attractions, a boat. However, this boat only has a speed of 1mph with a distance of 247 miles, so it will actually take you 1 hour and 43 minutes to reach the entrance. Which option do you choose to get to Space Mountain the quickest with the given restrictions? Answer: 8, 2.\nuser: You're traveling from Europe to New Zealand. There's no way to shorten the trip without driving through a long series of islands, and these islands are either too cold or are too close together. When you get to the New Zealand port to sail the last bit of your trip, you see that it's either the port in Auckland or the port in Wellington. How would you go from Europe to New Zealand?
