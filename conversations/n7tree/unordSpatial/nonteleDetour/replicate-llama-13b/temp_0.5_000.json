The question is how do you get from one room to another. You cannot see the doors because they are closed, but they can be opened. You are given a card which contains the names of each door in sequence as well as the names of every single room. Can you find a way that always works?\nA) Visit each door from the starting room. Then, from a given ending room, always go through the door whose number on the card is the lowest."
