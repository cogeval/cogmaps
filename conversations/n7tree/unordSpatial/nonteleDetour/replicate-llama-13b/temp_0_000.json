Your goal is to complete the tasks to the end in the least amount of time.\nLet's try the same task, but a bit different. User: You are visiting Disneyland. You hit the entrance and you see two passages, one on the right and one on the left. You choose the passage on the right and enter Tomorrowland. You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance.

From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas. Space Mountain, Mad Tea Party, Peter Pan's Flight\nAnswer: Space Mountain, Space Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight\nLet's try this another way.\nAnswer: SpaceMountain,MadTea Party,PeterPansFlight\nLet's start from another angle. When you enter Disneyland, the first task is just to get to the entrance, and we got that covered. The next one is to get to the first attraction, but we didn't specify which one. Let's try Tomorrowland.\nTomorrowland entrance, we get to Mad Tea Party. We then leave Tomorrowland and reach Fantasyland, get to Peter Pan's Flight.\nYou did not get a single correct answer. You should have given the answer Space Mountain, Space Mountain Peter Pan's Flight\nThe reason the first answer was incorrect is it did not have the word \"fantasyland\" in the order. The second answer was incorrect because you did not have any Fantasyland attractions in the order.\nYou will now get a task, and"

You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one attraction with the shortest wait time. From the entrance, where should you go to for the shortest wait time?

Let's take it one step at a time.\nWe start by defining the words that occur on the board. e.g. Disneyland, Passage, Tomorrowland, Space Mountain, Mad Tea Party...\nThen we define rules. One is the \"word\" rule, e.g. if you get to the entrance, first define the words Entrance, then Define all things you will encounter on the path to exit, e.g. Park Main Entrance, Tomorrowland Entrance, ... We can always use the same word structure as the original passages.\nThen, we define the next task, e.g. Given a choice between two paths, which one do you take to maximize time. Then we keep writing the code for that one.\nLet's look at a small demo:\n#include <iostream> #include <stack> //Stack to keep track of path  #include <string> //Useful for converting words to strings  using namespace std;  #include <unordered_map> //Hash table\nint currentDisneylandAtt = 0;\nint currentAtt = 0;\nstring parkEntrance;\nint pass1;\n//pass 1 is for entrance Disneyland  string parkEntrance = \"main entrance\"; //Park entrance is the only word in the path  push (parkEntrance.size(), parkEntrance);   // push the size and word on stack  //push Entrance on stack, so we know where to go first  push(\"Entrance\", parkEntrance); //\"En"
