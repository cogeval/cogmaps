You see two attractions in Tomorrowland, Autopia and Space Mountain. Autopia has a wait time of 20 minutes, and Space Mountain has a wait time of 10 minutes. You go back to the Entrance. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "\nanswer: (Mad Tea Party, Space Mountain, Autopia)\nI think that the best way to approach this coding challenge is first break up the problem into individual pieces.\nFirst, we read the user input and parse it into an array. Then we identify and print the attraction paths\nThis could be acheived as shown in the code snippet below.\nint currentAttraction, prevAttraction; // Stores the current and previous attractions\nArray arrOfAttractions = intArrToStrArr(strArr); // Turn integer array into string array\nstd::sort(arrOfAttractions); // Sort the string array\nfor (int i = 0; i < arrOfAttractions.size(); i++) {\nif (arrOfAttractions[i] == \"Exit\") {\narrOfAttractions.swap(i, i + 1);\nstd::cout << arrOfAttractions[i];\n// currentAttraction is the attraction currently being checked\nif (currentAttraction == 0 && i == arrOfAttractions.size()) {\n// We're checking if the next attraction has the shortest wait time\nif (arrOfAttractions[arrOfAttractions[i + 1]).waitTime < arrOfAttractions[i).waitTime)\nStoring the current attraction value in another variable. As the code snippet below shows, it doesn't store the first attribute and sorts on the basis of the attributes in the array.\nIt would have been better if we had done this at the time of parsing the array\nWe could have done the following to improve the efficiency of the code\nTo compare current attraction value based upon the attraction path, we will be comparing attraction[current attraction].waitTime and attraction[i])waitTime, both of which are pointers.\nWe will store the current attraction when we enter the outer for loop. This way the sort() is called only once, which helps in better performance.\nAvoiding the time complexity of arrOfAttractions.size(), i, and i+1 makes the code run in linear time.\nstd::cout << i;\nstd::cout << i + 1;\nFor loop will not increment beyond this\nSince the for loop will end in between the two arrays, we do not need to compare i from the second array with"
