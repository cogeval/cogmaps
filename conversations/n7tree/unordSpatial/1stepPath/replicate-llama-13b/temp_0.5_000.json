This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

One of the most difficult problems in AI is called the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Given a graph with n cities, and cost matrix $c$, the TSP asks us to return a route for visiting each city that minimizes total cost. There is a popular greedy $2$-opt heuristic for solving the TSP in about $O(n^3)$ time: it simply selects among the first two cities the one with the minimum cost and then selects the third city among the ones having the minimum cost from the two that were not selected. When time is extremely limited, you are given the following TSP. The cities of the TSP are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. The cities are numbered so that they appear in order in the left to right, top to bottom ordering of the output strings below. Each city in the sequence appears only once. Let's say that the cities are named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and C, in that order. Assume that $s_i$ is the cost from city $i$ to all other cities.\nTask 4. There are two kinds of tasks that we want AI to solve in real applications: problems that provide a clear answer to a well-defined question, and problems that present one with a set of observations and a description of the problem they occur in, and that let the AI use that information to find a solution, rather than simply providing a solution as input. Task 4 combines elements of both of those kinds of tasks. AI will receive a description of the following scenario where you are an AI in a space ship. You are given a rocket and a set of stars with their distances from each other (in kilometers). There is only one rocket and it has a limited amount of jet fuel. Your goal is to visit the closest star to you along the shortest path. The input is given below.\nTask 5. The task is a modified version of the"
