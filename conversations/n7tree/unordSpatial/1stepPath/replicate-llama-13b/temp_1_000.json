This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to Fantasyland. Again, you see two attractions, Mad Tea Party and Peter Pan's Flight. Mad Tea Party has a wait time of 5 minutes, and Peter Pan's Flight has a wait time of 15 minutes. Given your limited time in Disneyland, assume you can pick one attraction only. From the Entrance, which attraction should you go to for the shortest wait time? Please list the path to attraction in order, separated by commas."

The other tasks from other tutorial questions can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/learn/prize991\nHow can I go through the regular expression to obtain the information needed?\nThe following is from another person's comment and I am trying the following but it gives me a long error message as well as the error of the input not being what this regular expression is.\nThe input can only have information separated by whitespace or new lines, and the input is always space-delimited. Each input string can have at most 20-characters that aren't spaces.\nThe output should not contain any whitespace and can contain any character (not including whitespace). There are no uppercase characters, new lines, new lines or special characters in the output. The number of characters in your output is the minimum of the number of characters between the start and end index as well as the length of your input.\nSay: I would go to Mad Tea Party because its average wait time is 5 minutes\nHere is the input, and the space that is between them would mean a white space or space symbol when you say in an input line in Java.\nAnswer: (mad tea party,\\s*,\\(\\d+\\),\\s*\\(5\\))*,,\\*\\s*(\\S*,\\s*\\(\\d+\\),\\s*)\\,10)\nYour RegEx was the regular expression I used with the test code I was running. I will paste the code I was running with the error message that was given to show you the error that was made by the java file.\nAnswer:(((mad* tea-party\\|[^*]*)\\s*,\\s*\\((\\d+)\\))*,((\\S*,\\s*\\(\\d+\\),\\s*)\\)|(\\(\\d+\\),\\s*(\\S*,\\s*\\(\\d+\\))\\s*)|(\\(\\d+\\),\\s*\\((\\S*,\\s*\\(\\d+\\))\\)\\s*)))\nI was just hoping to get some assistance in the general line of what to do to get the input to work.

It's got some big regex issues with too much alternation, it's over-complex and you have a regex parsing issue.\n\nComment: Hi, what are you asking about? What is not working in your code?\n\nComment: @scohe001 please clarify. There are no \"too complex and too big\" regex issues. See the solution using `(+[^*]*)\\s*\\((\\d+\\|\\S*\\,\\,\\d+\\|\\S*\\,\\S*\\,\\d+)\\)`\n\nComment: My original regex was the issue along with not making a proper use of the regular expression. The second solution worked just fine and was easy to understand. Thanks to Kira and the person who posted the regular expression to use. Thanks for the quick help.\n\nAnswer: You can simplify the expression a lot by just using a simple pattern to match the main keyword on its own:\n\n`^.+Answer:( +RegEx +, ).*?,\\s*.*?\\w+`.\n\nThis will basically match the entire text of what's after `Answer:`, ignoring any trailing whitespace.  It will also make sure to get the entire expression, including the commas after it.\n\nThen we just match whatever's between that expression and the first comma in our input.  We only worry about characters, so only include characters in the match expression we care about.  You can include the comma if you like, I don't think it's super-necessary, but it's an option.\n\nFinally, just get the last number from what was matched before the comma:\n\n`matches.lastIndexOf(/\\d+/);`.\n\nThis regex would work for the input you give here, \"Answer: (mad tea party,\\s*,\\((\\d+)\\))*,,\\*\\s*(\\S*,\\s*\\(\\d+\\),\\s*)\\,10).\", if you made your input like such"
