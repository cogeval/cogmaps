You choose the field on the right and enter the sunflower field. You see two fields through the sunflower field. You can choose the field on the left or the field on the right. You choose the field on the right, and you enter the hydrangea field where you find 50 hydrangea flowers given away for free but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any flowers. Then you go back to the sunflower field, and this time you go to the field on the left to the orchid field. There you find 10 orchid flowers for free (but you don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. This time you choose the field on the left and you go to the rose field. Again, you see two fields, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the field on the right, and you find yourself in the daisy field. In the daisy field, you find 22 daisy flowers given for free. Then you go back to the rose field, and this time you go to the field on the left. You enter the tulip field where you find 56 tulip flowers for free (you still don't take any flower). You go back to the entrance. Given you didn't take any flower during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect flowers. From the entrance, where do you go to get the maximum number of flowers? Please list the flower names in order, including the entrance, separated by commas."

At the entrance, you can choose to go to the right or left.\n2. If you go to the right, you enter the sunflower field.\n3. From the sunflower field, you can choose to go left or right.\n4. If you go right, you enter the hydrangea field with 50 hydrangea flowers.\n5. If you go left, you enter the orchid field with 10 orchid flowers.\n6. After visiting the hydrangea or orchid field, you go back to the sunflower field.\n7. From the sunflower field, you can choose to go left or right.\n8. If you go right, you enter the daisy field with 22 daisy flowers.\n9. If you go left, you enter the tulip field with 56 tulip flowers.\n10. Finally, you go back to the entrance.\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum number of flowers for each path:\n\nPath 1: Right (sunflower field) -> Right (hydrangea field) -> Right (daisy field)\nTotal flowers: 50 hydrangea flowers + 22 daisy flowers = 72 flowers\n\nPath 2: Right (sunflower field) -> Left (orchid field) -> Left (tulip field)\nTotal flowers: 10 orchid flowers + 56 tulip flowers = 66 flowers\n\nPath 3: Left (orchid field) -> Left (tulip field)\nTotal flowers: 10 orchid flowers + 56 tulip flowers = 66 flowers\n\nPath 4: Left (orchid field) -> Right (daisy field)\nTotal flowers: 10 orchid flowers + 22 daisy flowers = 32 flowers\n\nBased on these calculations, the path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers is Path 1, which goes through the sunflower field, hydrangea field, and daisy field.\n\nTherefore, the order of flower names, including the entrance, separated by commas, is: Entrance, Sunflower field, Hydrangea field, Daisy field.\n\nAnswer: Entrance, Sunflower field, Hydrangea field, Daisy field"
