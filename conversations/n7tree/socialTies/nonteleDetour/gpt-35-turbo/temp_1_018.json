Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

However, we also learn that his secretary Kim is dating Jing. \n\nGiven this new information, it is likely that Jing's donations might be influenced by Kim, who is in close proximity to Amir.\n\nTherefore, we should consider meeting with Kim, as it might increase the chances of getting a higher donation from Jing.\n\nTo get the maximum number of books, we should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Kim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing"
