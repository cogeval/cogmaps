In this case, I will start with Amir, the CEO of the company. Since Amir does not have any salespersons reporting to him, I need to check the two senior managers, Wim and Raj. \n\nChecking Wim, I find that he has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books from Wim and his salespersons is 78 (56 + 22).\n\nChecking Raj, I find that he has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj and his salespersons is 60 (10 + 50).\n\nComparing the totals, I can see that the maximum number of books comes from Wim and his salespersons. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, I should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Since the previous path is now blocked, I need to reassess the options.\n\nSince Kim, Amir's secretary, is dating Jing, one of Wim's salespersons, it is likely that Jing's path is also blocked. Therefore, I will focus on Raj's path.\n\nChecking Raj, I find that he has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj and his salespersons is 60 (10 + 50).\n\nComparing this total with the previous maximum of 78 books, it is clear that Raj's path provides a lower number of books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books with the new circumstances, I should meet with the following people in order: Amir and Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
