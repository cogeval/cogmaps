Therefore, we do not need to consider him as a source of books.\n\nMoving on to the senior managers, Wim and Raj. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two options, we see that we can get a higher number of books from Wim's team (78 books) compared to Raj's team (60 books).\n\nTherefore, from Amir, we should meet with Wim first to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
