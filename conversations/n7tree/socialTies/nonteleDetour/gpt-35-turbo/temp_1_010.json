Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Jing donated 56 books and Wei donated 22 books, so the total is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of books donated by Raj's salespersons. Nisha donated 10 books and Reza donated 50 books, so the total is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, the senior manager who has the highest number of books donated by their salespersons is Wim with a total of 78 books.\n\nSince Amir is the CEO and does not have any salespersons reporting to him directly, you should meet with Wim to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Amir (CEO) -> Wim (Senior Manager) -> Jing (Salesperson) -> Kim (Secretary)\n\n2. Amir (CEO) -> Raj (Senior Manager) -> Nisha (Salesperson)\n\nCalculating the number of books on each path:\n\n1. The previous calculation showed that Jing donated 56 books. If we assume that Jing influenced Kim to donate the same number of books, then Kim may also donate 56 books.\n\n2. Nisha donated 10 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, the total number of books on the first path is 56 + 56 = 112 books, while the total number of books on the second path is 10 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, you should meet with Wim, then Jing, and finally Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Kim"
