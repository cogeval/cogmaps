Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing (56 books) and Wei (22 books). Raj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha (10 books) and Reza (50 books). \n\nComparing the number of books donated by each salesperson, we can see that Jing has the highest number (56 books). Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Jing. \n\nTherefore, the order of people you should meet, including Amir, to get the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing."
