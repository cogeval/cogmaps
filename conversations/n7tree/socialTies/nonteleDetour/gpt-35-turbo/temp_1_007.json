Amir -> Raj -> Nisha: 10 books\n4. Amir -> Raj -> Reza: 50 books\n5. Amir -> Kim -> Jing: unknown\n\nSince we don't know how many books Kim can donate, we cannot determine the total number of books for path 5.\n\nBased on the available information, the maximum number of books can be obtained by following path 4:\n\nAmir -> Raj -> Reza.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza"
