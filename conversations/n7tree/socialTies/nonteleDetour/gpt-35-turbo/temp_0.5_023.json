Since Amir is the highest authority, we should meet with him first. \n\nNext, we need to determine which senior manager has the most salespersons reporting to them. Wim has two salespersons (Jing and Wei) reporting to him, and Raj also has two salespersons (Nisha and Reza) reporting to him. \n\nTo maximize the number of books, we should meet with the senior manager who has the salespersons donating the most books. Wim's salespersons (Jing and Wei) are donating a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. On the other hand, Raj's salespersons (Nisha and Reza) are donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim after meeting with Amir. \n\nIn summary, the order of people to meet with, including Amir, is: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Therefore, it might be more beneficial to meet with Raj to potentially maximize the number of books.\n\nTherefore, the order of people to meet with, including Amir, to get the maximum number of books is: Amir, Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
