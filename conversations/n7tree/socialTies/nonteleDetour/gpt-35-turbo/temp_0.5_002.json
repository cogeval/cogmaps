Amir (CEO): Amir does not have any salespersons reporting to him directly, so he does not have any books to donate.\n\n2. Wim (Senior Manager): Wim has two salespersons reporting to him - Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. In total, Wim can provide 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n3. Raj (Senior Manager): Raj has two salespersons reporting to him - Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. In total, Raj can provide 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on the analysis, Wim can provide the maximum number of books.
