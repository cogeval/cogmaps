As the CEO, Amir doesn't have any salespersons reporting to him directly, but he has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj. \n\nNext, let's move to Wim. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nNow, let's move to Raj. Raj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nTo get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Reza first since he is donating the highest number of books (50 books). Next, we should meet with Jing, who is donating the second-highest number of books (56 books). Finally, we should meet with Amir, who is the CEO.\n\nTherefore, the order of people we should meet to get the maximum number of books is: Reza, Jing, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing, Amir"
