Starting from Amir, the CEO, we need to choose between his two senior managers: Wim and Raj. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him, Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nTo maximize the number of books collected, we need to choose between Wim and Raj based on the total number of books donated by their respective salespersons. \n\nWim's team (Jing and Wei) has a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books donated.\nRaj's team (Nisha and Reza) has a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books donated.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim and his team. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Nisha (previously chosen path)\n    b. Reza (previously chosen path)\n4. Kim (mentioned as Amir's secretary)\n\nSince we are now unable to choose the previously selected path, we need to consider the remaining options. \n\nKim, who is Amir's secretary, might have a different connection that could lead to a higher number of book donations. However, we do not have any information about Kim's involvement in the sales company or whether he has any salespersons reporting to him. Thus, we cannot consider Kim as a viable option at this point.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim and his team, as determined from the previous analysis.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
