Wim has two salespersons under him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, if we choose this path, we would collect a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nNext, let's consider the path with Raj. Raj has two salespersons under him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So, if we choose this path, we would collect a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nTherefore, the path with Wim gives us the maximum number of books. \n\nThe order of people we should meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
