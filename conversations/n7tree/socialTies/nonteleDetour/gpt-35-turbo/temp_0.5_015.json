We need to determine which senior manager has the highest total number of books donated by their salespersons. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei, who are donating 56 books and 22 books respectively. The total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nRaj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 books and 50 books respectively. The total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the totals, we can see that Wim's team has donated more books than Raj's team. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim. \n\nTherefore, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

However, we have new information that his secretary Kim is dating Jing.\n\nSince Jing was previously part of Wim's team, we can assume that she will still have access to the books donated by Wim's team. Therefore, we should consider meeting with Kim to potentially access the books donated by Jing.\n\nAfter meeting with Kim, we can then proceed to meet with Wim, as he had the highest total number of books donated by his salespersons in the previous scenario.\n\nTherefore, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Kim, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Wim."
