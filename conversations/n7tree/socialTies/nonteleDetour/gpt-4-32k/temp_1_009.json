Amir is the CEO and has Wim and Raj reporting to him.\n2. Wim has Jing and Wei reporting to him.\n3. Raj has Nisha and Reza reporting to him.\n4. Jing is donating 56 books, Wei is donating 22 books, Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.\n\nSecond, I would calculate the total number of books each path would yield:\n\n1. Going through Wim (Wim, Jing, Wei) would give us: 56 books (Jing) + 22 books (Wei) = 78 books in total.\n2. Going through Raj (Raj, Nisha, Reza) would give us: 10 books (Nisha) + 50 books (Reza) = 60 books in total.\n\nFrom this, I can deduce that going through Wim yields more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Jing is donating 56 books, Wei is donating 22 books, Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books.\n5. Since Jing is dating Kim, and the path through Jing is now blocked, we can no longer take the path: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nSecond, I would choose the remaining valid path to yield the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Going through Raj (Raj, Nisha, Reza) gives us: 10 books (Nisha) + 50 books (Reza) = 60 books in total.\n\nFrom this, I can deduce that going through Raj now yields the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
