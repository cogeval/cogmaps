They are Wim and Raj. \n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager. \n\nFor Wim: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books donated under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nFor Raj: Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books donated under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books donated under each senior manager. \n\nWim's team has donated 78 books and Raj's team has donated 60 books. Therefore, the path through Wim results in more books. \n\nStep 4: Identify the salespersons under Wim. They are Jing and Wei. \n\nStep 5: Since we're supposed to list the names in order, the path from Amir to get the maximum number of books would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nNow, provide the final outcome.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

They are Nisha and Reza. \n\nStep 3: Determine the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.
