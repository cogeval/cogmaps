Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

The total number of books from this path is 56 (from Jing) plus 22 (from Wei) which equals 78 books.\n\nPath 2: Amir, Raj, Nisha, and Reza. The total number of books from this path is 10 (from Nisha) plus 50 (from Reza) which equals 60 books.\n\nNext, I will compare the total number of books from each path. Path 1 has a total of 78 books, whereas Path 2 has a total of 60 books.\n\nTherefore, it is evident that the path with the maximum number of books is Path 1.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

The total number of books from this path is 10 (from Nisha) plus 50 (from Reza) which equals 60 books.\n\nHowever, since Kim is introduced into the equation and she is dating Jing, it's possible Kim may also have books. Unfortunately, without more information about Kim's potential book donations, I must assume she's not contributing to the book count. \n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the path leading to the maximum number of books would be the one including Amir, Raj, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
