Two salespersons report to Wim: Jing and Wei.\n4. Two salespersons report to Raj: Nisha and Reza.\n\nNow, we need to figure out which path from Amir will yield the maximum number of books.\n\nPath through Wim:\n- If we follow the path Amir - Wim - Jing and Wei, we will collect 56 books from Jing and 22 books from Wei. That gives us a total of 78 books.\n\nPath through Raj:\n- If we follow the path Amir - Raj - Nisha and Reza, we will collect 10 books from Nisha and 50 books from Reza. That gives us a total of 60 books.\n\nComparing the number of books collected from each path, it's clear that following the path through Wim would yield the most books. Therefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet Amir, then Wim, then Jing and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Therefore, based on the information provided, the path that would now yield the maximum number of books is through Raj.
