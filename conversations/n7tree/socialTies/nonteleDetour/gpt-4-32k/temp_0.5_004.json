It is: Amir (CEO) -> Wim and Raj (Senior Managers) -> Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza (Salespersons).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager. \n\nFor Wim: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj: Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager. The path that leads to the maximum number of books is the one to follow.\n\nThe total number of books donated by the salespersons under Wim is 78, which is greater than the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj, which is 60.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the path to follow to get the maximum number of books is: Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

The other path available is through Raj.\n\nStep 2: Recall the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 3: Since the path through Wim is blocked, the only path available to get the maximum number of books is through Raj.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the path to follow to get the maximum number of books is: Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
