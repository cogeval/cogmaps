Summing these, the total book donation from Raj's team is 60 books. \nWe are tasked to choose a path that will yield the maximum number of books. \n\nComparing the totals, it's clear that the path through Wim's team yields more books. \n\nSo the order of names to meet with would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
