Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Thus, the path through Wim will yield the maximum number of books.\n\nSo, the order of names to meet with to get the maximum number of books, starting with Amir, is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
