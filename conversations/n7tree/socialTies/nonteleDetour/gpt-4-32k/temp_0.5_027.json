So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj's team includes Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by each team, Wim's team is donating more books. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
