This will help me determine which manager oversees the salespersons donating the most books. \nNext, I'll start with the CEO, Amir, and then add the name of the senior manager who oversees the salespersons who are donating the most books, and finally the names of those salespersons, in any order.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of books donated by Jing and Wei (56 books + 22 books = 78 books). This is the total for Wim's team.\n2. Calculate the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza (10 books + 50 books = 60 books). This is the total for Raj's team.\n3. Compare the totals: Wim's team has donated more books than Raj's team.\n\nNow, I will create the list of names in order to collect the maximum number of books. \n\nStarting with Amir, then going to the senior manager with the most book donations under his team, which is Wim, then going to his salespersons, Jing and Wei. So the order is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nFinally, I can present the final outcome. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
