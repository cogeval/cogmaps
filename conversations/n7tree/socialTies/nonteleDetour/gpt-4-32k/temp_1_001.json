Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza\n\nNext, I will calculate the total number of books that can be collected from each path. \n\nFor Path 1, the total number of books is the sum of the books Jing and Wei are donating, which is 56 + 22 = 78.\n\nFor Path 2, the total number of books is the sum of the books Nisha and Reza are donating, which is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nComparing the two totals, Path 1 provides the maximum number of books.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei in that order. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
