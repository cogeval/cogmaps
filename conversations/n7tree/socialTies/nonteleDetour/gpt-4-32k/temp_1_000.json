Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

In this case, Wim's team has donated 78 books, which is more than Raj's team who have donated 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, the path would be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
