He has two senior managers, Wim and Raj, who have a total of 8 salespersons reporting to them. Among the eight salespersons, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are donating a total of 196 books. Therefore, meeting with Amir first and asking him to arrange for the books to be collected from his senior managers and their respective salespersons will give us the maximum number of books. \n\nPlease note that this is a thought process and not a direct answer to the question."
