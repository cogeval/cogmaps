Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, in total, Wim can contribute 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nOn the other hand, we have Raj, the other senior manager. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Thus, Raj can contribute 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the number of books donated by Wim and Raj, we see that Wim can donate more books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
