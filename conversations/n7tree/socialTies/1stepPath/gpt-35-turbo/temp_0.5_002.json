Amir is the CEO of the company, so we start with him.\n2. Wim and Raj are the two senior managers reporting to Amir.\n3. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n4. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books from Wim's team and Raj's team, we can see that Wim's team has the maximum number of books to donate.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
