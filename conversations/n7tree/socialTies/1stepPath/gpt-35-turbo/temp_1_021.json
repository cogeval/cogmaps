Amir: Since Amir is the CEO, he is not directly donating any books. \n\n2. Wim: Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\n3. Raj: Raj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nBased on the donations, we can see that Jing is donating the most books with 56 books. \n\nSo, the path to get the maximum number of books from Amir would be: Amir, Wim, Jing. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Amir, Wim, Jing."
