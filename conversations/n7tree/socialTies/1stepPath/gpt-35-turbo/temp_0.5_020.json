Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei, and Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza.\n\nTo find the maximum number of books, we need to consider the number of books donated by each person in the chain. \n\nStarting from Amir, we can calculate the total number of books donated by each person:\n\nAmir: 0 books (as given in the information)\nWim: 0 books (since his salespersons have donated the books)\nRaj: 0 books (since his salespersons have donated the books)\nJing: 56 books\nWei: 22 books\nNisha: 10 books\nReza: 50 books\n\nNow, we can see that the maximum number of books is donated by Jing (56 books).
