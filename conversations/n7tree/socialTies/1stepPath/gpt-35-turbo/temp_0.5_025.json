Since Amir is not donating any books, we move to the next level.\n\nAmir has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj. We need to compare the number of books donated by the salespersons under each manager.\n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78.\n\nRaj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim first, followed by Amir. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir"
