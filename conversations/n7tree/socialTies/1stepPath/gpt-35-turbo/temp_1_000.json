Meet with Wim: Wim has two salespersons, Jing and Wei. We know that Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, if we choose this path, we would collect a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n2. Meet with Raj: Raj has two salespersons, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, if we choose this path, we would collect a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, we see that the maximum number of books can be obtained by meeting with Wim first. Therefore, the order of individuals to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
