Amir is the CEO of the company, so we start with him.\n2. Under Amir, we have two senior managers: Wim and Raj.\n3. We need to compare the number of books donated by Wim's salespersons (Jing and Wei) with the number of books donated by Raj's salespersons (Nisha and Reza).\n4. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books, making a total of 78 books.\n5. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books, making a total of 60 books.\n6. Since 78 books is greater than 60 books, we should meet with Wim to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
