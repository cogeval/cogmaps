Since Amir is not donating any books, we need to consider his two senior managers: Wim and Raj.\n\nNext, we evaluate Wim and Raj separately. \n\nFor Wim, he has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, while Wei is donating 22 books. Since Jing has a higher number of books (56), we prioritize meeting with Jing.\n\nFor Raj, he also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, while Reza is donating 50 books. Since Reza has a higher number of books (50), we prioritize meeting with Reza.\n\nNow, comparing the paths of Wim and Raj, we see that Reza has the highest number of books (50) among all the individuals.\n\nTherefore, the order of names to get the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, is:\n\nAmir, Raj, Reza\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza"
