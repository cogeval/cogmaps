Let's calculate the total number of books donated by each person:\n\n- Amir (CEO): No information provided about the number of books donated.\n- Wim (Senior Manager): No information provided about the number of books donated by Wim directly, but we know that Jing (salesperson under Wim) is donating 56 books and Wei (another salesperson under Wim) is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj (Senior Manager): No information provided about the number of books donated by Raj directly, but we know that Nisha (salesperson under Raj) is donating 10 books and Reza (another salesperson under Raj) is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on the information provided, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is through Wim's team. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
