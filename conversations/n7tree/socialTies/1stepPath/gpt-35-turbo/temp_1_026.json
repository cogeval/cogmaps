Since he has no salespersons reporting to him, he will not be donating any books.\n\nNext, let's consider Wim, one of the senior managers. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing, who is donating 56 books, and Wei, who is donating 22 books. Therefore, we should definitely meet with Wim to collect books.\n\nMoving on to Raj, the other senior manager. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha, who is donating 10 books, and Reza, who is donating 50 books. Since Reza is donating more books than Nisha, we should meet with Reza as well.\n\nIn summary, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim, followed by Reza. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Reza"
