Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha and Reza are under Raj. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nNow, I will compare the total number of books under both senior managers to find out under whom there are more books.\n\n78 books (under Wim) is more than 60 books (under Raj). \n\nSo, to collect the maximum number of books, one should meet with Wim and the salespersons under him.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
