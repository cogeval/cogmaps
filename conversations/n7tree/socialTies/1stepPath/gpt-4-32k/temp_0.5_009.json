Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj and his team:\nRaj's team consists of Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by each team, Wim's team is donating more books (78 books) compared to Raj's team (60 books).\n\nSo, to collect the maximum number of books, I should meet with Amir, then Wim, followed by Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
