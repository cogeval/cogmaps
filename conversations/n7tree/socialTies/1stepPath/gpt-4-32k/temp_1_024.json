Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

The order should start from Amir since that is where you start collecting the books. The order is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
