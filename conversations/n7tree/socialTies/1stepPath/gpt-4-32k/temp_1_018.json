So, the total books under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nComparing the total number of books under each senior manager, Wim has more books (78) than Raj (60).\n\nNext, I will list the names in order, starting from Amir, followed by the manager with the maximum books, and then the people under him.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
