Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Together, they are donating 78 books.\n\nSecond, I'd add the number of books Nisha and Reza are donating, as they report to Raj.

Together, they are donating 60 books.\n\nComparing the two totals, the path that goes through Wim yields more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
