He has two possible paths to follow: via Wim or Raj.\n\nIf I go through Wim, I will meet Jing and Wei. They donate 56 and 22 books respectively, so this path provides 56 + 22 = 78 books in total.\n\nIf I go through Raj, I will meet Nisha and Reza. They donate 10 and 50 books respectively, so this path provides 10 + 50 = 60 books in total.\n\nComparing these totals, the path through Wim gives the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, in order to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei, in that order. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
