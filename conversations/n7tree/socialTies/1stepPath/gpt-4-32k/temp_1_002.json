Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

That's 56 books from Jing and 22 from Wei, making a total of 78 books for path 1.\n\nSecondly, we add up the books donated by Nisha and Reza, who both report to Raj. That's 10 books from Nisha and 50 books from Reza, giving us a total of 60 books for path 2.\n\nBy comparing the totals, the first path offers the most books. Hence, to collect the maximum number of books, it's best to visit Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei. \n\n"
