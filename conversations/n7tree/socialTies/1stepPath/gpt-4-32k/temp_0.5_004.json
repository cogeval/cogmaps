Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, in total, I can collect 56 + 22 = 78 books from this path.\n\nIf I follow the path of Raj, I can meet with two people: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, in total, I can collect 10 + 50 = 60 books from this path.\n\nComparing the two paths, the path through Wim allows me to collect more books. \n\nSo, the order of people I should meet with to get the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
