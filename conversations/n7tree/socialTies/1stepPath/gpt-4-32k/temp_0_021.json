So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager, Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
