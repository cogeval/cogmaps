Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Path through Wim: \n- Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei. \n- The total number of books is the sum of the donations from Jing and Wei. \n- Jing and Wei are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. \n- So, total books from the path through Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n2. Path through Raj: \n- Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza. \n- The total number of books is the sum of the donations from Nisha and Reza. \n- Nisha and Reza are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. \n- So, total books from the path through Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nSince the path through Wim results in a higher number of books, the order of names will be Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
