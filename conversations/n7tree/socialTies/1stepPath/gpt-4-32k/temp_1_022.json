Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

This involves summing up the total number of books donated by each salesperson and their manager.\n\nLet's start with Wim's team:\n\nWim's team includes Jing and Wei who are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. This gives a total of 78 books (56 + 22 = 78).\n\nNext, we'll look at Raj's team:\n\nRaj's team includes Nisha and Reza who are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. This gives a total of 60 books (10 + 50 = 60).\n\nComparing the totals, it's clear that the path involving Wim's team yields the most books.\n\nGiven that Amir is at the top of this path, the order in which you should meet the people would be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nThis is because Amir is the CEO, Wim is the manager under Amir, and Jing and Wei are the salespersons reporting to Wim. The order reflects the hierarchy in the company. \n\nThe final output will include all these names separated by commas. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."
