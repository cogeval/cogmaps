So, the total number of books for Path 1 is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Path 2, Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books for Path 2 is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two totals, Path 1 has more books than Path 2.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the people in Path 1. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
