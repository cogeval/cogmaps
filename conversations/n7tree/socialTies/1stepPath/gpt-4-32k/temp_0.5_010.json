Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Wim has Jing and Wei under him, and Raj has Nisha and Reza under him. The number of books each individual is donating is given as follows: Jing - 56, Wei - 22, Nisha - 10, Reza - 50.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two paths:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei. The total number of books collected would be 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n2. Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza. The total number of books collected would be 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing these two totals, it's clear that the first path yields more books.\n\nThe final outcome is the path yielding the maximum number of books, which is Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
