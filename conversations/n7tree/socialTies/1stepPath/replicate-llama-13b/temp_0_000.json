So we can use \uff0c* to match anything until we reach the comma and then we're back to \uff1a\n@CodyGaynor The regex you wrote, \uff0c* would match a comma followed by anything, and then it would match anything until it reaches the next comma.\n@CodyGaynor Actually, I should say that we can't add spaces between the two characters, so we need to use the character \\u00a0 instead of \" , \"\n@CodyGaynor If you test it again, it seems that the regex you wrote only matches the last character in the list, which is why the output didn't make any sense. You need \"Suresh, Anita, Karuna , Bunty, Reeta, Ramesh\"\nThis challenge has been viewed 5,193 times"
