Since Jing is donating the most books, this path is the best path.\r\n\r\nHowever, you mentioned that the path that led to the maximum number of books is now blocked. In this case, we cannot meet with Wim or Jing directly. However, we can still meet with Jing by meeting with Wim first. Once we meet with Wim, we can ask him to introduce us to Jing. If Wim is willing to introduce us to Jing, we can then meet with her and collect the maximum number of books.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best path to collect the maximum number of books is to meet with **Amir, Wim, and Jing**.\r\n\r\n**Answer: Amir, Wim, Jing**"
