To help you out, here is the first one:\n\nThis question is an open-ended question, you can solve this in any programming language. You can search online for \"the quick sort algorithm\".\n\nThe question says you need to count the occurrences of a number in an array, but the hint says you don't need to count the number, just return 1 or 0.\n\nGiven a sorted array of integers, return the index of the first occurrence of a given number in the array.\n\nIf the number does not exist in the array, return -1. Note that if the number exists multiple times, return the index of the first occurrence.\n\nWrite a program to find the minimum"
