The structure of the company is hierarchical with Amir at the top, followed by two senior managers, Wim and Raj. Each manager has two salespeople reporting to them. \n\nStep 1: Compare the total book donations from the salespeople reporting to each senior manager. \nWim's team, consisting of Jing and Wei, has donated a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \nRaj's team, made up of Nisha and Reza, has donated a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 2: Decide which path to take based on the total donations from each team. Wim's team has donated more books, so the path will go through Wim.\n\nStep 3: Decide which salesperson to meet based on their individual donations. Jing donated more books than Wei, so the path will continue to Jing.\n\nThe final path to collect the maximum number of books goes through Amir, Wim, and Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
