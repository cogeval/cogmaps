Therefore, Wim's path will yield 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNisha and Reza report to Raj, and they are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. Therefore, Raj's path will yield 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two totals, it's evident that Wim's path will yield more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
