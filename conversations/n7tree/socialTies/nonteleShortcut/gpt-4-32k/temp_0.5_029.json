Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Jing and Wei is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNext, I will add up the number of books donated by Nisha and Reza, who report to Raj. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager, I find that Wim's team (Jing and Wei) is donating more books than Raj's team (Nisha and Reza).\n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, I should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei. \n\nSo the names in order should be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
