Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

The total is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nThen, I will calculate the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza, who report to Raj.\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. The total is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing these two totals, I can see that Wim's team (Jing and Wei) is donating more books than Raj's team (Nisha and Reza). \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, I should follow the path from Amir to Wim and then to Jing and Wei. \n\nFinal Answer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."
