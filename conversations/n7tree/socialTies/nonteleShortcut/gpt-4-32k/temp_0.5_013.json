Then, I will select the path that yields the maximum number of books.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the total number of books donated by Jing and Wei, who report to Wim:\n56 (from Jing) + 22 (from Wei) = 78 books\n\nSecond, I will calculate the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza, who report to Raj:\n10 (from Nisha) + 50 (from Reza) = 60 books\n\nComparing the two totals, the path through Wim yields more books. So, the path to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
