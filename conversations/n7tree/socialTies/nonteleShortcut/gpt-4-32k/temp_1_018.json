I need to calculate the total number of books each path can provide. \n\nFor the first path: \n- Amir leads to Wim, which leads to Jing and Wei. \n- Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n- So, the total for this path is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor the second path: \n- Amir leads to Raj, which leads to Nisha and Reza. \n- Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n- So, the total for this path is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBy comparing the two totals, the path with Wim, Jing, and Wei provides the highest number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
