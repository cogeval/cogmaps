This way, it can be found out under whose management the most books are being donated.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of books under Wim:\n    - Jing's donations + Wei's donations\n    - 56 books + 22 books = 78 books\n\n2. Calculate the total number of books under Raj:\n    - Nisha's donations + Reza's donations\n    - 10 books + 50 books = 60 books\n\nWim's group has more books donated than Raj's group. Therefore, the path of meeting that allows to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
