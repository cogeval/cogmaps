Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Identify the total number of books donated by each of the senior managers' teams.\n2. Wim's team is composed of Jing and Wei, who respectively donated 56 and 22 books. To find the total number of books donated by Wim's team, I will add these numbers.\n3. Raj's team is composed of Nisha and Reza, who respectively donated 10 and 50 books. To find the total number of books donated by Raj's team, I will add these numbers.\n4. Compare the total donations of Wim's team with Raj's team to identify which path to take for the maximum number of books. \n\nLet's calculate:\n\nWim's team donation: 56 (Jing) + 22 (Wei) = 78 books.\nRaj's team donation: 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nComparing these totals, Wim's team donated more books. Therefore, the path with the maximum number of books includes Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."

Jing has donated more books compared to Wei. \n\nTherefore, starting from Amir, the path to collect the maximum number of books would be through Wim and then Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing."
