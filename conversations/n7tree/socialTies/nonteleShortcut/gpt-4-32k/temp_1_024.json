Wim's team: Jing (56 books) + Wei (22 books) = 78 books\n2. Raj's team: Nisha (10 books) + Reza (50 books) = 60 books\n\nComparing the totals, Wim's team is donating more books. \n\nSo, following the hierarchy structure and choosing the path that results in the maximum number of books, the order of people to meet is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
