These paths are:\n    - Amir, Wim, Jing\n    - Amir, Wim, Wei\n    - Amir, Raj, Nisha\n    - Amir, Raj, Reza\n\nStep 2: Now, I will calculate the total number of books I would collect from each path:\n    - For the path Amir, Wim, Jing, the number of books would be 56.\n    - For the path Amir, Wim, Wei, the number of books would be 22.\n    - For the path Amir, Raj, Nisha, the number of books would be 10.\n    - For the path Amir, Raj, Reza, the number of books would be 50.\n\nStep 3: The next step is to compare the total number of books from each path. This would enable me to identify which path leads to the collection of the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 4: Upon comparison, the path with the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing. Therefore, this is the path I should follow to collect the maximum number of books.\n\nFinal Outcome:\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
