The total number of books they're donating is 0 (Wim) + 56 (Jing) + 22 (Wei) = 78 books.\n\nRaj's team includes Raj himself, Nisha, and Reza. The total number of books they're donating is 0 (Raj) + 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nFrom the calculations, it's clear that going through Wim's team will yield the most books. \n\nSo the order of persons to meet to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
