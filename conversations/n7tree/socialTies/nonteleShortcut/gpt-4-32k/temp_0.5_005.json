The two paths are: Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei, and Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books donated by Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. The total is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. The total is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 4: Compare the total number of books donated on each path. The path through Wim (78 books) has more books than the path through Raj (60 books).\n\nStep 5: List the names in order for the path with the most books. The order is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
