If we meet with Wim, we can then meet with Jing and Wei. However, since Jing is donating the most books, we can also meet with Jing directly. Since Jing is donating the most books, this path is the best path.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that the path that led to the maximum number of books is now blocked. In this case, we need to find a new path. We can start by meeting with Amir and asking him about Kim's portal. Kim's portal allows us to meet with any of Wim's direct reports, which includes Jing. Therefore, the best path to collect the maximum number of books is to meet with **Amir, Kim, and Jing**.\n\n**Answer: Amir, Kim, Jing**"
