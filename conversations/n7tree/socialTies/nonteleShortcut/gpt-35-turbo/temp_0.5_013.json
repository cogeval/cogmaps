Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nIf we choose Raj, we have two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two options, we see that Wim's team has a higher number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
