Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. This means the total number of books available through Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj, the other senior manager, has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. This means the total number of books available through Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim and then Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
