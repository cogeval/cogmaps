Amir is not donating any books.\n\n2. Next, we need to choose between the two senior managers: Wim and Raj. We should choose the manager who has the highest number of books donated by their salespersons.\n\n   - Wim has two salespersons, Jing and Wei, who are donating 56 books and 22 books respectively. This gives us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n   - Raj has two salespersons, Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 books and 50 books respectively. This gives us a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\n   Therefore, we should choose Wim as the next person to meet with.\n\n3. Finally, we need to meet with Wim's salespersons: Jing and Wei. Since Jing is donating more books (56 books) compared to Wei (22 books), we should meet with Jing.\n\nTherefore, the order of people we should meet with, starting from Amir, to get the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
