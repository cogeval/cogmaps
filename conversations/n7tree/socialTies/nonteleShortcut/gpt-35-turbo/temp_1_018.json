Amir (CEO): We start with Amir, who does not directly donate any books.\n2. Wim (Senior Manager): Wim has two salespersons reporting to him. However, we know that Jing is donating 56 books, which is higher than any other donation. So, meeting Wim would not yield the maximum number of books.\n3. Raj (Senior Manager): Raj has two salespersons reporting to him. Among them, Reza is donating 50 books, which is the second-highest donation. Thus, meeting Raj would yield more books than meeting Wim.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Raj. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"

Wim (Senior Manager): Wim has two salespersons reporting to him, Jing and Wei. Among them, Jing donates 56 books, which is the highest donation so far.\n3. Jing (Salesperson under Wim): Jing's donation of 56 books remains the highest count, so meeting with him would maximize the number of books collected.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
