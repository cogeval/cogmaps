Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Let's calculate the total number of books each person can contribute:\n\n- Amir: As the CEO, Amir does not have any salespersons reporting to him directly. Therefore, he does not have any books to donate.\n\n- Wim: Jing and Wei are reporting to Wim. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim can contribute a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n- Raj: Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. Thus, Raj can contribute a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on the calculations, Wim has the maximum number of books to donate. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Let's calculate the total number of books for each path:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim: Wim can contribute 78 books.\n\n2. Amir -> Wim -> Jing: Wim (78 books) + Jing (56 books) = 134 books.\n\n3. Amir -> Wim -> Wei: Wim (78 books) + Wei (22 books) = 100 books.\n\n4. Amir -> Raj: Raj can contribute 60 books.\n\n5. Amir -> Raj -> Nisha: Raj (60 books) + Nisha (10 books) = 70 books.\n\n6. Amir -> Raj -> Reza: Raj (60 books) + Reza (50 books) = 110 books.\n\nBased on the calculations, the path with the maximum number of books is Amir -> Wim -> Jing, which gives a total of 134 books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
