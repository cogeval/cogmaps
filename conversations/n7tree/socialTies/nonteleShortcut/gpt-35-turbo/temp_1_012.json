Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim and Raj. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
