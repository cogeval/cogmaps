We compare the total number of books donated by the salespersons under each manager. \n\nUnder Wim, Jing donated 56 books and Wei donated 22 books, giving a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nUnder Raj, Nisha donated 10 books and Reza donated 50 books, giving a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nSince Wim has the highest total number of books donated, we should meet with him. \n\nTherefore, the order of names to meet with, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Jing donated 56 books, and Wei donated 22 books. So the total contribution from Wim's direct reports is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nComparing the total contributions, Wim's direct reports have a higher number of books donated compared to Wim himself.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of books collected, we should meet with Wim's direct reports, Jing and Wei.\n\nTherefore, the order of names to meet with, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."
