So, we should meet with Wim to get their donations. \n\nRaj, on the other hand, has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza, who donated 10 and 50 books respectively. However, since Wim's salespersons donated more books, we do not need to meet with Raj. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Amir and Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
