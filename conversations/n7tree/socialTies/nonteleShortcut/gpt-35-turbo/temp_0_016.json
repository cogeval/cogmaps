Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nIf we choose Raj, we have two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nComparing the options, we see that Jing is donating the highest number of books (56). Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Jing. \n\nSo, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim, Jing. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books.\n\nIf we choose Raj, we have two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.\n\nNow, considering the new information, we can meet with Wim directly and get the books from both Jing and Wei. This gives us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nComparing this with the other option of meeting with Jing, where we would only get 56 books, meeting with Wim directly gives us a higher number of books.\n\nSo, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
