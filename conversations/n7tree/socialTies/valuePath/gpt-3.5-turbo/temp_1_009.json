Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim has a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj, the other senior manager, has Nisha and Reza reporting to him. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, Raj has a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, we can see that Wim has donated more books than Raj. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
