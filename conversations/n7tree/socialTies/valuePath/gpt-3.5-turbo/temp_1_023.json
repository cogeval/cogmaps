Since Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books, we should meet with Jing first to collect 56 books. \n\nNext, we move to Raj, who has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Since Reza is donating 50 books and Nisha is donating 10 books, we should meet with Reza to collect 50 books. \n\nFinally, we conclude by meeting with Amir, who doesn't have any books to donate. \n\nTherefore, the order in which we should meet with individuals to get the maximum number of books is: Jing, Reza, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Reza, Amir"
