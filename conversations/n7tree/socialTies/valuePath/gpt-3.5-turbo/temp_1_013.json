Amir is the CEO and has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei, while Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. \n\nLet's calculate the number of books each person can contribute:\n\n1. Amir: As the CEO, we need to consider his own donation. Since it is not mentioned in the information provided, we assume Amir is not donating any books.\n\n2. Wim: Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim can contribute a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n3. Raj: Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. Thus, Raj can contribute a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on the calculations above, Wim can provide the maximum number of books, so we should meet with Wim to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
