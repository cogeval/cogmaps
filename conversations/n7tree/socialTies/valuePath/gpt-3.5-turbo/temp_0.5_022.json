Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books, so the total number of books from this path would be 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nIf we choose Raj, we can then collect books from Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books, so the total number of books from this path would be 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path through Wim gives us the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
