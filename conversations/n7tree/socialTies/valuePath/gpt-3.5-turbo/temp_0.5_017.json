Since Amir is the top-level manager, we need to consider the number of books donated by the salespersons reporting to him. \n\nWim, one of the senior managers reporting to Amir, has two salespersons, Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj, the other senior manager reporting to Amir, also has two salespersons, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. The total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two teams, Wim's team has donated a higher number of books (78 books) compared to Raj's team (60 books). \n\nHence, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
