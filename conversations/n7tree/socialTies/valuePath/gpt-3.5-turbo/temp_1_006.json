Amir -> Wim -> Jing\n2. Amir -> Wim -> Wei\n3. Amir -> Raj -> Nisha\n4. Amir -> Raj -> Reza\n\nTo determine the path with the maximum number of books, we need to calculate the total number of books for each path:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim -> Jing: 56 books (Jing's donation)\n2. Amir -> Wim -> Wei: 22 books (Wei's donation)\n3. Amir -> Raj -> Nisha: 10 books (Nisha's donation)\n4. Amir -> Raj -> Reza: 50 books (Reza's donation)\n\nThe highest total number of books can be obtained by following the path:\nAmir -> Raj -> Reza\n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Raj, and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza"
