If we meet with Wim, we can then meet with Jing and Nisha. If we meet with Raj, we can then meet with Nisha and Reza.\r\n\r\nJing and Nisha donate a total of 56 + 10 = 66 books. Nisha and Reza donate a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. Therefore, the path that donates the most books is to meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Nisha.\r\n\r\n**Answer: Answer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Nisha**\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
