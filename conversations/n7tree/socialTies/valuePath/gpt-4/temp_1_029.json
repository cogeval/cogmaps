He has two senior managers reporting to him: Wim and Raj. \n\nNow, I need to determine the number of books donated by the salespersons under each manager. \n\nWim supervises Jing and Wei. Jing donates 56 books and Wei donates 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj supervises Nisha and Reza. Nisha donates 10 books and Reza donates 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total books collected from Wim's team and Raj's team, Wim's team donates more books.\n\nSo, if I want to collect the maximum number of books, I should go from Amir to Wim's team.\n\nHence, the order of people I should meet to get the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nNow, provide the final outcome according to the given format.\n"
