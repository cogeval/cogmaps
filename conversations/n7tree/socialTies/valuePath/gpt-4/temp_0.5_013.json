Raj has Nisha and Reza reporting to him.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books donated by each team. Jing and Wei are donating 56 and 22 books respectively, so Wim's team is donating 78 books. Nisha and Reza are donating 10 and 50 books respectively, so Raj's team is donating 60 books.\n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books donated by each team. Wim's team is donating more books than Raj's team.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path to collect the maximum number of books. The path that will lead to the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
