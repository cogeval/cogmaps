Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Jing donates 56 books and Wei donates 22 books. Adding up the books donated by either Jing or Wei with their manager Wim's (who doesn't donate), the total for the first path would be 56 books if I choose Jing and 22 if I choose Wei.\n\nThe second path goes from Amir, to Raj, then to either Nisha or Reza. Nisha donates 10 books and Reza donates 50 books. Adding up the books donated by either Nisha or Reza with their manager Raj's (who also doesn't donate), the total for the second path would be 50 books if I choose Reza and 10 if I choose Nisha.\n\nComparing the totals from each path, the first path with Jing yields more books than the second path with Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
