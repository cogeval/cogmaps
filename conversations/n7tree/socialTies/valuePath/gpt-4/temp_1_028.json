Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. This totals to 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nSecond, let's calculate Raj's path:\n- Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. This totals to 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two totals, it's evident that going through Wim would result in the collection of more books.\n\nIn conclusion, the path to follow to collect the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."
