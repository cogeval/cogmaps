Wim's salespersons are Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total books when choosing Wim will be 56+22 = 78 books.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of books if Raj is chosen. Raj's salespersons are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total books when choosing Raj will be 10+50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 5: Compare the two totals - 78 books when choosing Wim and 60 books when choosing Raj.\n\nStep 6: Determine the path with the maximum books. From the above calculation, it is clear that following the path through Wim results in the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 7: List the names in order from Amir to the salesperson.\n\nFinal Outcome:\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
