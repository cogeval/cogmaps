Therefore, Wim's team is donating a total of 78 books.\nUnder Raj, Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, Raj's team is donating a total of 60 books.\nWith this information, I can determine that I should meet with Wim's team (i.e., Wim, Jing, and Wei) to get the maximum number of books.\nI would list the names in order from Amir to the salesperson who is donating the books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
