By choosing this path, a total of 56+22 = 78 books would be received.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of books that would be received if we follow Amir->Raj->Nisha or Reza.\n\nRaj's team consists of Nisha and Reza who are donating 10 books and 50 books respectively. By choosing this path, a total of 10+50 = 60 books would be received.\n\nStep 3: Compare the totals from both the paths.\n\nComparing 78 and 60, it's clear that choosing the path of Wim would yield a higher number of books.\n\nFinal Step: Formulate the answer based on these findings.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
