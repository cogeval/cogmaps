For Wim's team, Jing and Wei are donating a combined total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. For Raj's team, Nisha and Reza are donating a combined total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nSecond, since Wim's team is donating more books, the path to collect the maximum number of books would involve meeting with Wim and his salespersons. \n\nThus, the order of names to meet to collect the maximum number of books, starting from the CEO, would be Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
