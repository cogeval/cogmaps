To decide, I need to add up the number of books donated by each manager and their salespersons.\nStep 3: Wim's team (Wim, Jing, and Wei) donates a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\nStep 4: Raj's team (Raj, Nisha, and Reza) donates a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\nStep 5: Since Wim's team donates more books than Raj's team, I will meet with Wim after Amir.\nStep 6: Lastly, within Wim's team, Jing donates more books (56) than Wei (22), so I will meet with Jing after Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
