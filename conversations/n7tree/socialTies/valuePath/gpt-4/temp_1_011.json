Amir - Raj - Reza\n\nWe need to compare the number of books each salesperson is donating to find the path with the maximum number of books.\n\nJing is donating 56 books.\nWei is donating 22 books.\nNisha is donating 10 books.\nReza is donating 50 books.\n\nUpon comparing, it's evident that Jing is donating the most number of books, so the path yielding the maximum books would be Amir - Wim - Jing. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
