Ramesh can introduce you to his two employees, Karuna and Bunty. Reeta can introduce you to her two employees, Anita and Sunny. Karuna has 4 rating for friendly collaboration while Bunty has a rating of 2. Anita has a rating of 2.5 while Sunny has a rating of 3.5. You can only have one person to start your collaboration. Starting from Suresh, which employee do you want to be introduced to for the highest friendly collaboration rating? Please list the path to the employee in order, separated by commas."

You will have to figure out the path so you can get a higher rating.\nRohit Vimalrajani\nSolving the problem from a programming perspective -\nThe simplest and most efficient approach would be to start from the CEO (Suresh).\nFurther, he (Suresh) will introduce the other team members to me one by one and I will take decisions. The final decision-making criteria depends on the number of the team members who are friendly.\nI will first calculate friendly collaboration rating of Suresh by looking at his rating as CEO and rating of his direct team members Karuna and Bullu. The direct team members will always have higher friendliness rating than boss. Following the same approach, I will calculate friendly collaboration rating of Karuna and Ramesh. If both have equal amount of friendliness rating or if Karuna has a slightly higher rating then I will take Karuna for the next round. But If Ramesh has a slightly better ratings then I will take Ratnesh instead of Karuna. In case Rathnesh does not have direct team members then I will simply look for the second highest team member with direct team members (if there is a tie, then boss's rating would be priority in deciding friendliness) for Ratnesh. Similarly, I will continue with the path for all the team members.\nThis approach may not always be optimum but it works 95% of the time.\nThe best way would be to go with Suresh. He would know his team members best, and he will get maximum number of people to collaborate with. The path goes Suresh -> Karuna -> Ramesh -> Reeta -> Anita -> Sunny = 4.5\nA different approach -\nAbove solution is just a brute-force way of solving this problem. The solution mentioned below will not lead to any kind of recursive nature and will be easily approachable. We can represent this as a directed graph.\nThe goal of the above problem is to maximize the sum of the ratings of employees and CEO. In the above method, we will create the graph DG such that\nSource : Suresh\nDestination : (CEO, Karuna, Ramesh, Reeta, Anita and Sunny)\nSource -> Destination : Karuna, Ramesh,"
