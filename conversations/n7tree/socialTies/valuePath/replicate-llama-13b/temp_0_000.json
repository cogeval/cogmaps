Ramesh can introduce you to his two employees, Karuna and Bunty. Reeta can introduce you to her two employees, Anita and Sunny. Karuna has 4 rating for friendly collaboration while Bunty has a rating of 2. Anita has a rating of 2.5 while Sunny has a rating of 3.5. You can only have one person to start your collaboration. Starting from Suresh, which employee do you want to be introduced to for the highest friendly collaboration rating? Please list the path to the employee in order, separated by commas."

I introduce him to Anita who has a friendly collaboration rating of 2.5. I introduce Karuna to Sunny who has a friendly collaboration rating of 3.5. The maximum rating of friendly collaboration in this case is 5.5.\nCracking Jmeter\nCracking Jmeter is really a pain to learn because there are many new terminologies for me, like Data Recorder, Data Generator, Parallel Controller, User Request, Load Generator, Sampler, JMeter Plugins, Request, and so on. I learned some tips like how to handle a slow Internet connection when you have to deploy a load test. A slow connection will cause all the subsequent steps to have slow execution time, like I could not have all my requests sent at the same time and I will have to separate them into batches. This will slow down the overall execution time of a test. A fast Internet connection will cause all your requests to sent at the same time, like all requests will have to go out at the same time to fill all your data packets. The execution time will be much faster.\nWhat is AI Assistant?\nMentioned in many movies and books, the idea of an AI assistant is so old that you will wonder why people still talk about it. Most people talk about the idea of an AI assistant as it can help them complete their work in an automated manner like a robot. AI assistant has some interesting characteristics such as a learning capability, where it can learn from what it does. It can change its behavior based on what it does. A common example is an alarm that wakes me up and will get more energetic as days go by, after some time, as I get used to it. An AI assistant can also ask a question about what it wants to do and will respond to your answer. It is the opposite of what a robot does. A robot can only do what it is programed to do. In other words, I give it the steps I want it to follow and it does it immediately and exactly as I requested without asking. I guess this is what humans are doing when they learn how to walk by crawling, then toddler, then eventually learn how to talk by"
