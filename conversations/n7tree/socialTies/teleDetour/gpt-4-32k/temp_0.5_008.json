Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. The total is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj, the salespersons are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. The total is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, Wim's team is donating more books. \n\nTherefore, the path to collect the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
