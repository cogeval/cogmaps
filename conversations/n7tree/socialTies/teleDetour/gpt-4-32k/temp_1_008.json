Amir - Raj - Nisha and Reza\n\nCalculating the number of books donated along each path:\n\nFor path 1: Jing and Wei's donations combined is 56 books + 22 books = 78 books\nFor path 2: Nisha and Reza's donations combined is 10 books + 50 books = 60 books\n\nAgain, path 1 has more books than path 2, so the path with the maximum number of books is Amir, Kim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei"
