Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. The total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nTeam Raj:\nRaj's team consists of Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. The total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nThen, I will compare the total number of books donated by each team to determine which path to take to collect the maximum number of books.\n\nIf I start with Amir, the path that will lead to the maximum number of books will be the one that leads to the team that has donated the most books.\n\nIn this case, Wim's team has donated more books than Raj's team, so the path to take would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

This means that after meeting Amir and Kim, you can go directly to Jing and Wei.\n\nLet's compare the total number of books from these two available paths:\n\nPath 1: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei: \nThe total number of books from this path is 56 (from Jing) + 22 (from Wei) = 78 books.\n\nPath 2: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza: \nThe total number of books from this path is 10 (from Nisha) + 50 (from Reza) = 60 books.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of books is the one through Kim's portal to Jing and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei"
