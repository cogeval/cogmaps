Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Team Wim (Wim, Jing, Wei): \n    Wim's team has donated a total of 56 (Jing) + 22 (Wei) = 78 books. \n\n2. Team Raj (Raj, Nisha, Reza): \n    Raj's team has donated a total of 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books. \n\nNext, compare the total numbers: \nTeam Wim donated more books than team Raj. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, the path is Amir -> Wim -> Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.

However, we can still access Wim's team indirectly through Kim.\n\nThe path would therefore be Amir -> Kim -> Jing/Wei. But considering the total number of books, it would be more advantageous to meet with Jing who has more books than Wei.\n\nOn the other hand, we have a clear path to Raj's team, which comprises of Raj, Nisha and Reza. \n\nWe then calculate the total number of books if we choose each path:\n\n1. Path to Jing (Amir -> Kim -> Jing): The total number of books would be 56 (Jing)\n2. Path to Raj's team (Amir -> Raj -> Nisha, Reza): The total number of books would be 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books\n\nComparing the totals, the path to Raj's team leads to a greater number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
