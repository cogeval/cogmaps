Under Raj, Nisha and Reza are donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nSince the salespersons under Wim are donating more books than those under Raj, if the aim is to collect the maximum number of books, it would make more sense to meet with Wim and his team. \n\nThus, the order should be: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n"
