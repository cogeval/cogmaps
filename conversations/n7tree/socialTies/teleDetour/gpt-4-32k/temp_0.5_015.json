Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha and Reza are reporting to Raj. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nNow, comparing the total number of books from each team, Wim's team is donating more books than Raj's team.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Kim has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to to meet with any of Wim\u2019s direct reports. When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.  You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This means I can bypass Wim and go directly to either Jing or Wei. \n\nJing donates 56 books and Wei donates 22 books. If I choose the path through Kim to Jing, I would collect more books than the path through Kim to Wei.\n\nSo, the path to get the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, would be: Amir, Kim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing"
