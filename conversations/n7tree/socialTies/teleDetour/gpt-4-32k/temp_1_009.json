Their combined donations of books are 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj's path:\nNisha and Reza are both reporting to Raj. Their combined donations of books are 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nFrom these calculations, the maximum number of books can be obtained by following the path through Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
