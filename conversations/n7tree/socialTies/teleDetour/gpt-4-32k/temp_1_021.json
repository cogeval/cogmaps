Jing and Wei are reporting to Wim, and they are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. If I sum these up, it gives a total of 78 books.\n\nSecond, I'll consider the path under Raj. Nisha and Reza are reporting to Raj, and they are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. If I sum these up, it gives a total of 60 books.\n\nBy comparing the total number of books from each path, it's clear that the path under Wim gives the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Next, I will meet Raj and then his direct reports, Nisha and Reza, to collect their donations. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
