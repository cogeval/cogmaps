Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

In total, they are donating 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj's team includes Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. In total, they are donating 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nThen, compare the total number of books donated by each team:\n\n- Wim's team is donating 78 books.\n- Raj's team is donating 60 books.\n\nClearly, Wim's team is donating more books. Therefore, to collect the maximum number of books, one should meet Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
