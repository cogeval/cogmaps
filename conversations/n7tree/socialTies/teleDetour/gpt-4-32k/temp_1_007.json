Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

So, total = 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nStep 2: \nCount the total books donated by the salespersons under Raj. \nNisha and Reza, reporting to Raj, are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. So, total = 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 3: \nComparing the total number of books from Step 1 and Step 2, it is evident that you can collect more books from the salespersons reporting to Wim.\n\nSo, the answer would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."

Kim has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to to meet with any of Wim\u2019s direct reports. When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.  You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books?

This means you can still collect books from Jing and Wei, Wim\u2019s direct reports.\n\nAmir's other senior manager, Raj, and his direct reports Nisha and Reza can be reached without going through the blocked path.\n\nTo maximize book collection, you would thus first go to Kim, use her portal to meet with Wim\u2019s direct reports, then meet with Raj and his direct reports.\n\nThe path to collect the maximum number of books would then be Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza."
