Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

If I choose Wim, the total number of books I can collect from his team is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nOn the other hand, under Raj, there are Nisha who is donating 10 books and Reza who is donating 50 books. If I choose Raj, the total number of books I can collect from his team is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two totals, I can see that the path through Wim gives more books. \n\nTherefore, the optimal path to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

If I choose Jing, I get 56 books and if I choose Wei, I get 22 books. \n\nOn the other hand, If I decide to not go through Kim but instead meet with Raj directly from Amir, I can collect 10 + 50 = 60 books from Raj's team, which includes Nisha and Reza. \n\nComparing these two paths, I can see that the path through Kim and Jing gives more books. \n\nTherefore, the optimal path to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Kim, Jing. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing"
