So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj's team:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, Wim's team is donating more books than Raj's team.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, I should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

So, the total number of books donated by going through Kim's portal is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj's team:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.
