Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Raj's team: Nisha (10 books) + Reza (50 books) = 60 books\n\nFrom this calculation, it's clear that Wim's team is donating more books in total.\n\nSo, the path to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Kim has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to to meet with any of Wim\u2019s direct reports. When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.  You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

As we calculated earlier, Raj's team (Nisha and Reza) is donating a total of 60 books.\n\nHowever, Kim has a portal that can lead to any of Wim's direct reports. This means we can bypass Wim and directly meet Jing or Wei. Since Jing is donating more books than Wei (56 vs 22), the new path should include Jing.\n\nTherefore, the path to collect the maximum number of books, considering the blockage and the portal, is: Amir, Kim, Jing, Raj, Nisha, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
