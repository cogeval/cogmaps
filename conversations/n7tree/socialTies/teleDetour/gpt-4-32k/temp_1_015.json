Therefore, in total from Raj's side, I would get 10+50=60 books.\nComparing the total number of books from Wim's side (78) and Raj's side (60), Wim's side has more books.\nSo, the correct path to collect the maximum number of books would be Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. In total from Kim's side, I would get 56+22=78 books.\nSince the path to Wim is now blocked, my other choice is to go to Raj directly from Amir. Under Raj, there are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, in total from Raj's side, I would get 10+50=60 books.\nComparing the total number of books from Kim's side (78) and Raj's side (60), Kim's side has more books.\nSo, the correct path to collect the maximum number of books would be Amir, Kim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei"
