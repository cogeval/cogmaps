Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.

This means we will need to meet Kim after Amir, then go through the portal to meet Jing and Wei who are offering a total of 78 books.\n\nThe other option, not using the portal, is to meet with Raj and his team (Nisha and Reza) who are donating a total of 60 books.\n\nComparing these two options, using the portal to meet Jing and Wei still results in more books. \n\nSo, the new path that will lead to the maximum number of books is Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei.\n\nTherefore, my final outcome is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei."
