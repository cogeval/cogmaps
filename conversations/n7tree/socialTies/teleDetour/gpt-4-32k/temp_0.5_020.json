Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing these two totals, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is the one that includes Wim and his salespersons. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei, in that order. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.

This means that it's possible to bypass Wim and go directly to Jing and Wei.\n\nTo get the maximum number of books, I should meet with Amir, then Kim, then Jing and Wei, because Jing and Wei collectively have more books than Nisha and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei"
