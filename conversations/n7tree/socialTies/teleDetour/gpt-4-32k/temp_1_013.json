We know that we can go from Amir to Kim and then through the portal to meet any of Wim's direct reports.\n\nThe path that was blocked was: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. Now, we have to consider paths that do not include both Jing and Wei.\n\nSo, the new potential paths we have are:\n\nPath 1: Amir, Kim, Jing (through the portal)\nNumber of books collected from this path = Donation from Jing (56 books)\n\nPath 2: Amir, Kim, Wei (through the portal)\nNumber of books collected from this path = Donation from Wei (22 books)\n\nPath 3: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza\nNumber of books collected from this path = Donation from Nisha (10 books) + Donation from Reza (50 books) = 60 books.\n\nBy comparing the total number of books collected from all paths, Path 3 allows for the collection of the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
