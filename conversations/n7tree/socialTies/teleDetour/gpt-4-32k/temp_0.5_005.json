Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj, the salespersons are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, the path through Wim results in more books. \n\nSo, the path to collect the maximum number of books would be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.

Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by the salespersons under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nHowever, since Kim has a portal to meet with any of Wim's direct reports, we can still meet with Jing and Wei, who are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. \n\nSo, the path to collect the maximum number of books would be: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
