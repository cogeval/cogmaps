Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

The path of Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza yields 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nThe second step is to compare the total number of books from each path. It's clear that the path through Wim yields more books (78) than the path through Raj (60).\n\nThe third step is to list the names in the path with the maximum number of books, starting with Amir and separating each name with a comma.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei."

Kim has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to to meet with any of Wim\u2019s direct reports. When you meet with Amir and choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, you discover that the path is now blocked.  You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books?

The path of Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza, which will yield 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books. \n\nEven with the direct path to Wim being blocked, using the portal through Kim to Wim's direct reports still yields the most books. \n\nTherefore, the path to choose for the maximum number of books, starting from Amir and listing each name separated by commas, would be:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei."
