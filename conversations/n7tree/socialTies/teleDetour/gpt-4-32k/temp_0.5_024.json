Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books Wim's team is donating is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj's team consists of Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books Raj's team is donating is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nNow, I need to compare the total number of books each senior manager's team is donating to determine which path will yield the maximum number of books.\n\nWim's team is donating 78 books and Raj's team is donating 60 books. So, the path that will yield the maximum number of books is through Wim's team.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

This means we can bypass Wim and still meet with Jing and Wei.\n\nSo, starting from Amir, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is now through Kim's portal to Wim's direct reports.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Jing, Wei"
