Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

This totals to 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nRaj's team consists of Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. This totals to 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two totals, Wim's team is donating more books than Raj's team. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, I should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
