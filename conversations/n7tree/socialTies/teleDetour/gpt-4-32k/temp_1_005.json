The salespersons under Wim (Jing and Wei) are donating a total of 56+22=78 books. The salespersons under Raj (Nisha and Reza) are donating a total of 10+50=60 books.\n\nSince Wim's team is donating more books, I should choose to go through Wim to collect the most books.\n\nSo, in order, starting from Amir, I should meet with Wim, then Jing, then Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
