The total books donated by Jing and Wei is 56+22=78 books.\nRaj also has two salespersons, Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. The total books donated by Nisha and Reza is 10+50=60 books.\nClearly, Wim and his team are donating more books than Raj and his team.\nAfter Amir and Wim, choose the salesperson between Jing and Wei who has donated more books. Jing has donated 56 books while Wei has donated 22 books. Therefore, Jing has donated more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
