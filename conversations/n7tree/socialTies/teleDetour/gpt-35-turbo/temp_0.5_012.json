So the total number of books from this path is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nIf we choose the path with Raj, we know that Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So the total number of books from this path is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the path with Wim has a higher total of 78 books, while the path with Raj has a total of 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim. \n\nSo the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, would be: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
