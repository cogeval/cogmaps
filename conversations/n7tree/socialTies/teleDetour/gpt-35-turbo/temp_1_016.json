Jing (Salesperson) - Donating 56 books.\n5. Wei (Salesperson) - Donating 22 books.\n6. Nisha (Salesperson) - Donating 10 books.\n7. Reza (Salesperson) - Donating 50 books.\n\nBased on the information provided, the maximum number of books can be obtained by meeting with Jing first, as she is donating 56 books. Therefore, the order of individuals to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing"
