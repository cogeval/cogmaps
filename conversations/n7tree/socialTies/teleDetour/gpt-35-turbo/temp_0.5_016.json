Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, meeting with Wim would give us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nRaj, the other senior manager, has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, meeting with Raj would give us a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim first, followed by Raj. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"

Therefore, meeting with either Jing or Wei will give us a total of 56 or 22 books, respectively.\n\nComparing the numbers, meeting with Jing will give us a higher number of books (56) compared to meeting with Wei (22).\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books starting from Amir, we should meet with Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing"
