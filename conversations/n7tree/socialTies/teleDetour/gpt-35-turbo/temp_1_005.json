Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Amir (CEO): We start with Amir, but he does not directly have any books to donate.\n\n2. Wim (Senior Manager): Wim has two salespersons reporting to him, Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. This gives us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n3. Raj (Senior Manager): Raj has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. This gives us a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on these calculations, we can see that meeting with Wim (Senior Manager) will result in the maximum number of books, which is 78 books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
