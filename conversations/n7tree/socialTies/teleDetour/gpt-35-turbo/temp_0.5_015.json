Start with Amir (CEO) - No books donated by Amir.\n2. Move to Wim (Senior Manager) - No books donated by Wim.\n3. Move to Jing (Salesperson) - Jing is donating 56 books.\n4. Move to Wei (Salesperson) - Wei is donating 22 books.\n5. Move back to Wim (Senior Manager) - Total books collected: 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n6. Move to Raj (Senior Manager) - No books donated by Raj.\n7. Move to Nisha (Salesperson) - Nisha is donating 10 books.\n8. Move to Reza (Salesperson) - Reza is donating 50 books.\n9. Move back to Raj (Senior Manager) - Total books collected: 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books collected, we can see that the path through Wim (Senior Manager) leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order, including Amir, separated by commas: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
