Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nTo maximize the number of books, we should choose the path that leads to the highest number of books. \n\nConsidering the donations from each person, the path with the maximum number of books is as follows: \n\nAmir, Raj, Reza. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Raj, and Reza. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza."

However, since we cannot choose the path that led to the maximum number of books previously, we need to explore an alternative path.\n\nFrom Amir, we can choose to meet with either Wim or Raj. Let's analyze the number of books donated by their respective salespersons:\n\n- Wim's direct reports are Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books.\n\n- Raj's direct reports are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.\n\nTo get the maximum number of books, we should choose the path that leads to the highest number of books. Comparing the donations from each person:\n\n- Wim's team: Jing (56 books) + Wei (22 books) = 78 books.\n- Raj's team: Nisha (10 books) + Reza (50 books) = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books starting from Amir, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim."
