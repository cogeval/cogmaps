We start with Amir, the CEO, who has no direct reports donating books. Next, we look at Wim and Raj, the two senior managers.\n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim and his team is 56 + 22 = 78.\n\nRaj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj and his team is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nComparing the totals, we see that Wim and his team have donated more books than Raj and his team. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim.\n\nSo, the order of people to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
