Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Amir is the CEO, and he doesn't have any books to donate.\n\n2. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing (56 books) and Wei (22 books). So, we can collect a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books from Wim's team.\n\n3. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha (10 books) and Reza (50 books). So, we can collect a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books from Raj's team.\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim first, as his team has the highest number of books. \n\nTherefore, the order of people to meet, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
