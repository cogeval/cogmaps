Start with Amir, the CEO, who has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj.\n2. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books we can get from Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n3. Raj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books we can get from Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the number of books we can get from Wim and Raj, we can see that Wim has a higher number of books to offer. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
