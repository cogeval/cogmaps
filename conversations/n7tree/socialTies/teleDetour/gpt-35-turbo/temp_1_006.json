Therefore, we can ignore Amir as a potential source of books.\n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, meeting with Wim would yield a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, meeting with Raj would yield a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim, followed by Raj. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj"

Meeting with Wim: Previously, meeting with Wim yielded a total of 78 books (Jing: 56 books, Wei: 22 books).\n\n2. Meeting with Wim's direct reports: Since we can only choose one path, we need to evaluate the number of books donated by each salesperson under Wim.\n\n    a. Jing: Previously, Jing donated 56 books.\n    \n    b. Wei: Previously, Wei donated 22 books.\n\nTherefore, to find the maximum number of books starting from Amir, we need to choose between meeting with Wim or meeting with Jing (Wim's direct report who donated the most books).\n\nComparing the options:\n\n- Meeting with Wim yields a total of 78 books.\n- Meeting with Jing yields a total of 56 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
