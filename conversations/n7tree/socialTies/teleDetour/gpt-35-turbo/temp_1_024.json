Since he doesn't have any salespersons reporting to him directly, you move on to the senior managers under him. \n\nThe senior managers are Wim and Raj. You need to choose the one with the most number of books. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nBased on the number of books donated by each salesperson, you can see that Reza, who reports to Raj, has the most books (50). \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Raj. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
