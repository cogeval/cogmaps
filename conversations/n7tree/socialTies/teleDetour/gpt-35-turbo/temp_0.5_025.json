Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.\n\nComparing the number of books donated by Nisha and Reza, it is clear that Reza has donated more books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Raj, who is reporting to Amir, and then meet with Reza, who is reporting to Raj.\n\nSo, the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, are: Amir, Raj, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza."
