Therefore, he is not donating any books.\n\nMoving to the senior managers, Wim and Raj, we need to determine who has the maximum number of books donated by their salespersons.\n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, we can see that Wim has donated the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with the following people in order, including Amir: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
