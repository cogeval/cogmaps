Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Amir (CEO): It is not mentioned how many books Amir is donating.\n\n2. Wim (Senior Manager): Wim has two salespersons reporting to him, Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim's total donation is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n3. Raj (Senior Manager): Raj has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, Raj's total donation is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on this information, it is clear that Wim has donated the maximum number of books among the managers. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Amir (CEO): It is not mentioned how many books Amir is donating.\n\n2. Wim (Senior Manager): Since Jing is not donating any books, Wim's total donation remains the same, which is 22 books.\n\n3. Raj (Senior Manager): Raj has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, Raj's total donation is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on this updated information, Wim is still donating fewer books compared to Raj. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
