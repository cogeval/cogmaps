Since we want to maximize the number of books, we should choose the manager who has more books donated by their salespersons. \n\nWim's salespersons, Jing and Wei, are donating a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nRaj's salespersons, Nisha and Reza, are donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nTherefore, we should choose Wim over Raj because Wim has more books donated. \n\nSo the path to collect the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
