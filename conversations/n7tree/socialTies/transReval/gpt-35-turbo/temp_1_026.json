Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim can provide a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\nRaj (Senior Manager) has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza.

So, Raj can provide a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nSince Wim can provide a higher number of books (78), we should meet with him to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Wei is donating 22 books.\nRaj (Senior Manager) has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.\n\nIn this case, since Wim's salesperson Jing is not donating any books, it would be more beneficial to meet directly with Raj, who can provide a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
