Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books from Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj has Nisha and Reza reporting to him. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing Wim and Raj, we can see that Wim has the highest number of books to donate.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Thus, the total number of books from Raj is still 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing Wim (22 books) and Raj (60 books), we can see that Raj has the highest number of books to donate.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
