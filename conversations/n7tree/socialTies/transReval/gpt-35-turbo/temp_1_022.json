Since he does not have any books to donate, we move on to his two senior managers: Wim and Raj.\n\nBetween Wim and Raj, we need to determine who has more books. From the given information, we know that Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei, who are donating 56 books and 22 books respectively. This means that Wim has a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nOn the other hand, Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 books and 50 books respectively. This means that Raj has a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim first, followed by Raj, and finally Amir.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"

This means that we only consider Raj and his salespersons: Nisha and Reza.
