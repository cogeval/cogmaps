Amir has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj.\n\n3. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books available through Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78.\n\n4. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books available through Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\n5. Compare the totals from Wim's and Raj's teams. Wim's team has 78 books, while Raj's team has 60 books. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim.\n\nTherefore, the order of people to meet, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Start with Amir, the CEO of the company.\n\n2. Amir has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj.\n\n3. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Since Jing is not donating any books, we can exclude his contribution. Therefore, the total number of books available through Wim's team is only 22 (Wei's donation).\n\n4. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books available through Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\n5. Compare the totals from Wim's (22 books) and Raj's (60 books) teams. Raj's team has a higher number of books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Raj.\n\nTherefore, the order of people to meet, including Amir, separated by commas, is: Amir, Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj"
