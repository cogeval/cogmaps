Let's list the number of books donated by each person:\n\n- Amir (CEO): Unknown\n- Wim (Senior Manager): Unknown\n- Raj (Senior Manager): Unknown\n- Jing (Salesperson): 56 books\n- Wei (Salesperson): 22 books\n- Nisha (Salesperson): 10 books\n- Reza (Salesperson): 50 books\n\nSince we don't know the number of books donated by Amir, Wim, and Raj, we can start by finding the maximum number of books donated among the salespersons. Reza has donated the highest number of books (50), followed by Jing (56), Wei (22), and Nisha (10).\n\nNow, let's determine the path to collect the maximum number of books:\n\n- Amir (CEO): Unknown\n- Wim (Senior Manager): Unknown\n- Raj (Senior Manager): Unknown\n- Jing (Salesperson): 56 books\n- Wei (Salesperson): 22 books\n- Nisha (Salesperson): 10 books\n- Reza (Salesperson): 50 books\n\nBased on the hierarchy, we can conclude that Jing and Wei report to Wim, while Nisha and Reza report to Raj. Therefore, to maximize the number of books, we should meet with Wim and Raj.\n\nSo, the order of people to meet, including Amir, is: Amir, Wim, Raj.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
