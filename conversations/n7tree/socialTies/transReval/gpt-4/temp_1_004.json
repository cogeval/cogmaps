This means calculating the number of books being donated by the salespersons under each senior manager and comparing them. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of books that Wim's team is donating. \nJing and Wei, who report to Wim, are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. Therefore, Wim's team is donating a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books that Raj's team is donating. \nNisha and Reza, who report to Raj, are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. Therefore, Raj's team is donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books being donated by each team. \nWim's team is donating 78 books while Raj's team is donating 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should choose to meet with Wim's team. The order of people to meet is Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Wei, who also reports to Wim, is donating 22 books. Therefore, Wim's team is now donating a total of 0 + 22 = 22 books. \n\nStep 2: Recall the total number of books that Raj's team is donating. \nIn the previous calculation, we determined that Nisha and Reza, who report to Raj, are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. Therefore, Raj's team is donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books being donated by each team. \nWim's team is now donating 22 books while Raj's team is donating 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should choose to meet with Raj's team.
