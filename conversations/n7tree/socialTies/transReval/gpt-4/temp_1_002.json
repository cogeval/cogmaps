Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

The second path is through Raj to Nisha and Reza. \n\nThe next step is to add up the total number of books donated by the salespersons in each path. In the first path, Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books, so the total number of books for this path is 56 + 22 = 78 books. In the second path, Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books, so the total number of books for this path is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nThe final step is to compare the total number of books in each path. 78 books in the first path is more than 60 books in the second path, so you would choose the first path to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Therefore, the total number of books in this path is now 0 + 22 = 22 books. \n\nIn the path through Raj, Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books in this path remains the same, 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing these two totals, it is clear that the path through Raj will yield the most books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
