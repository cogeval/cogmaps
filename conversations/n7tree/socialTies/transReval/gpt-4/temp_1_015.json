First, compare the two paths under Amir which are Amir-Wim-Jing-Wei and Amir-Raj-Nisha-Reza. \n\nCalculating the total for each path: \n- Amir-Wim-Jing-Wei: 56 (Jing) + 22 (Wei) = 78 books\n- Amir-Raj-Nisha-Reza: 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books\n\nFrom the calculations, it's clear that the first path, Amir-Wim-Jing-Wei, provides more books.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, one should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
