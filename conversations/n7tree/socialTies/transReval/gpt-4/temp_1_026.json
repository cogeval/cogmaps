If I choose Raj, I would collect a total of 10+50=60 books.\n\nBy comparing the totals, I would collect more books if I choose the path Amir-Wim, as Wim's team is donating 78 books, which is more than the 60 books donated by Raj's team.\n\nTherefore, following the path from Amir to Wim would yield the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
