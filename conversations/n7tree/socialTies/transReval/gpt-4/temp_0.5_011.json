Jing and Wei are donating more books than Nisha and Reza.\n\nFinally, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then the senior manager who supervises the pair of salespersons who are donating the most books, and then the salespersons themselves. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
