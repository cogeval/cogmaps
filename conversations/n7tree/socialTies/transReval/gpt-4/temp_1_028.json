Path through Wim: Amir - Wim (Jing, Wei) \n   Total books = Jing's books + Wei's books\n                = 56 books + 22 books \n                = 78 books\n\n2. Path through Raj: Amir - Raj (Nisha, Reza) \n   Total books = Nisha's books + Reza's books\n                = 10 books + 50 books \n                = 60 books\n\nComparing the total books collected from each path, the path through Wim (78 books) yields more books than the path through Raj (60 books). Thus, to collect the maximum number of books, I should choose the path through Wim. \n\nTherefore, the order of people to meet to get the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, would be Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
