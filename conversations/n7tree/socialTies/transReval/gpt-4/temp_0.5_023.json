So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nNow, I need to compare the total number of books donated by each team to determine which path to take to collect the maximum number of books.\n\nSince 78 (Wim's team) is greater than 60 (Raj's team), the path that would result in the maximum number of books is through Wim's team.\n\nTherefore, the order of names to meet with to get the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
