So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by each team, Wim's team is donating more books. \n\nSo, to collect the maximum number of books, I should follow the path from Amir to Wim's team. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
