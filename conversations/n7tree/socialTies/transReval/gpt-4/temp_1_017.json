Here is a step by step approach to this problem:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir. He is the CEO and we have to meet him first.\n\nStep 2: From Amir, there are two choices - Wim or Raj.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total number of books being donated by the salespersons under both Wim and Raj. \n\nStep 4: For Wim, the total is 56 (Jing) + 22 (Wei) = 78 books. \n\nStep 5: For Raj, the total is 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nStep 6: Compare these totals. Wim's team is donating more books (78) than Raj's team (60).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, after meeting Amir, we should meet with Wim to collect the maximum number of books. \n\nStep 8: From Wim, there are two choices - Jing or Wei.\n\nStep 9: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nStep 10: Clearly, Jing is donating more books than Wei.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Jing after Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
