Jing has 56 books and Wei has 22 books.\n- Nisha and Reza report to Raj. Nisha has 10 books and Reza has 50 books.\n\nLet's find out the maximum number of books we can collect through each path:\n\n1. Amir-Wim-Jing-Wei: 56 (from Jing) + 22 (from Wei) = 78 books\n2. Amir-Raj-Nisha-Reza: 10 (from Nisha) + 50 (from Reza) = 60 books\n\nComparing these paths, the path through Amir-Wim-Jing-Wei has the maximum number of books. So, the order to meet would be Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
