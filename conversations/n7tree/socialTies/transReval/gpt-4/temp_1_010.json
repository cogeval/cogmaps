I will explore each path and calculate the number of books donated by each team.\n\nIn the path of Wim, we have Wim, Jing, and Wei.\nThe total number of books donated by Wim's team will be the sum of Jing and Wei's donations: 56 books (Jing) + 22 books (Wei) = 78 books.\n\nIn the path of Raj, we have Raj, Nisha, and Reza.\nThe total number of books donated by Raj's team will be the sum of Nisha and Reza's donations: 10 books (Nisha) + 50 books (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nComparing these, Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
