The total books in this path is 56 (Jing's books) plus 22 (Wei's books) = 78 books.\n\nPath two is Amir, Raj, Nisha, and Reza. The total books in this path is 10 (Nisha's books) plus 50 (Reza's books) = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two totals, 78 books (path one) is more than 60 books (path two).\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, the best path is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
