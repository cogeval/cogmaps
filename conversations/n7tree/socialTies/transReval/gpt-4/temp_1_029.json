Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza\n\nThen, I calculate the total number of books donated by people in each path:\n\nPath 1: Wim -> Jing and Wei. The total number of books donated by Jing and Wei is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nPath 2: Raj -> Nisha and Reza. The total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nLastly, I compare the total number of books for each path:\n\nPath 1 donates 78 books, which is greater than Path 2 which donates 60 books.\n\nSo, the path that results in the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

With Jing no longer donating books, the total donated on this path is now 22 books (all from Wei).\n\nPath 2: Amir -> Raj -> Nisha and Reza. This path remains the same, with a total donation of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nLastly, I compare the total number of books for each path:\n\nPath 1 donates 22 books, which is less than Path 2 which donates 60 books.\n\nSo, the path that results in the maximum number of books is now: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza"
