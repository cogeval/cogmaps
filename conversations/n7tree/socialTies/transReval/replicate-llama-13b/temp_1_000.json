Therefore my proposal is WM since Wj have more than twice as many people to contribute book-11, while Jing,Wim, and We contribute 3-5 plus Nisha, Reza adds 10 plus 5 so to talk with to give preference is Wim Answer: Wj,Jing', We and Ra \n\nAre their final answer correctly?

The reason and conclusion of such order of visitation based on logical evaluation. All three names, the more donors available, plus Re are more than twice Jing' so it makes Wm is my last consideration before heading out to meet other donors who have less contribution potential in order to maximize output  to my collection efforts. \nWere their final answer correctly? Can their final answer logically deduced in terms of collectioin criteria used. Please give just explanation for final answer including the names visited first, secondly.   \nCan the logical deduction by the AI  also list in numbers/quantites, book quantity to ensure maximized collection goals for optimal outcome?    \n\nAm sure  the final answer are Raj, Ai. But pls explain stepwise along the specified visitation pattern using deductions in a precise explanation logcially\nPls highlight step  specific to collectiomn criteria to collect maximum books"
