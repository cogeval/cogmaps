If multiple such combinations exist, choose the combination that has the largest second largest number.\n\nInterviewer: You have two machines and both are faulty. To find the faulty machine, you need to run a diagnosis test on both machines. The diagnosis test will pass on the working machine and fail on the faulty machine. However, you do not know which machine is working.\n\nYou are given three switches and three lamps. Lamps are labelled as A, B, and C. Switches are labelled as W, X, and Y. You need to find the switch for each lamp. You can do this by turning on one switch at a time and observing the lamp that turns on.\n\nThe second lamp is B.\nThe third lamp is A.\nThe third switch is Y.\n\nThe third lamp is C.\nThe third is X"
