Now, Anita can introduce me to her team member Sunny. So I will be introduced to Sunny with rating of 3.5 from Anita. Sunny can introduce me to his team member Karuna with a rating of 4 from Anita. Then I will be introduced to Karuna and we will collaborate with rating of 4. This is my path to get the maximum friendly collaboration rating.\nuser: You want to collaborate with a company. You meet Suresh, the CEO. You can ask Suresh to introduce you to Karuna, Reeta and Bunty. Karuna is a co-worker of Anita who will make a recommendation of the company where she has not worked, from her own network. She will introduce you to Bunty from that network. Bunty is a co-worker of Karuna who will recommend other companies that Bunty has not worked before, from her own network. Bunty will introduce you to Reeta, who will recommend other companies that have not worked for Anita or the company that worked for she or Bunty, from her own network. So you want to meet someone that will introduce you to the company that Karuna, Bunty or Reeta has not worked before. Please list the path to the employee in order, separated by commas.\nS: I would like to work with employees who have not worked for any of these companies in the past.\nuser: You look for a new job position and want to collaborate with companies that have not collaborated with each other in the past.\nS: How about not collaborating at all? If this answer makes sense, consider your homework completed. ;)\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\nIf a,b,c are three numbers how many combinations are there of two of these numbers which are relatively prime and the third is a multiple of both.\nuser: So the question is: \"How many is the number of combinations of two numbers from a set of three numbers that are relatively prime (in this case a^2 and b^2 are relatively prime)\" So: Number of choices for one number out of a set of three numbers = (3^2 - 1) / "
