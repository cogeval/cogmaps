Karuna has 4 rating for friendly collaboration while Bunty has a rating of 2. Anita has a rating of 2.5 while Sunny has a rating of 3.5. You can only have one person to start your collaboration.

But I wasn't sure how to get the path.\n\nThen I decided to do a recursive search. I'd start with Suresh and ask him to introduce me to someone, and then I'd keep doing that until I couldn't find anyone to introduce me to. But I didn't know how to do a recursive search in Ruby. I tried reading some examples, but I didn't understand them.\n\nFinally I realized that there was a much easier way to do this. I could iterate through the people and do an if-else.\n\nFirst I'd look to see if I'd already been introduced to the person. If I had, I'd ask the person to introduce me to someone else.\n\nThen I'd ask the person I was introduced to for someone to introduce me to. If they couldn't, I'd ask them to introduce me to someone else.\n\nThis turned out to be a lot easier than I expected. Once I got the basic idea, the code just flowed. But it did take a while to get the right idea.\n\nIt was"
