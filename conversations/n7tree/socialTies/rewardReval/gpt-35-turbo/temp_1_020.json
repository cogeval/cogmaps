Here are the steps to determine the correct path:\n\n1. Start with Amir, the CEO of the company.\n2. Check the two senior managers under Amir: Wim and Raj.\n3. Calculate the total donations from the salespersons reporting to each senior manager.\n   - For Wim, the total donation is 56 (from Jing) + 22 (from Wei) = 78 books.\n   - For Raj, the total donation is 10 (from Nisha) + 50 (from Reza) = 60 books.\n4. Compare the total donations from the salespersons under each senior manager.\n   - Wim has a higher total donation of 78 books compared to Raj's total donation of 60 books.\n5. Choose the senior manager with the higher total donation.\n   - In this case, we should choose Wim.\n6.
