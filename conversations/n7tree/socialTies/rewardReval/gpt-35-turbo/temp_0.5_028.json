Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books, giving us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nIf we choose Raj, we can then collect books from Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books, giving us a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two options, we see that meeting with Wim will result in a higher number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
