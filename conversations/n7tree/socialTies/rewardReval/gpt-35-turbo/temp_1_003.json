Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So the total number of books from Wim is 56 + 22 = 78. \n\nThen, we have Raj, who also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So the total number of books from Raj is 10 + 50 = 60. \n\nComparing the totals, we can see that Wim has donated more books than Raj. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, and Raj, in that order. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
