Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. The total for Wim's path is 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nNow, let's calculate for Raj's path:\nThe salespersons reporting to Raj are Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. The total for Raj's path is 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nFrom these calculations, it's clear that meeting with Wim and the salespersons under him would yield the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
