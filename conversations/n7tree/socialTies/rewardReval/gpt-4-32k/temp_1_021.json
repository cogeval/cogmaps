Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, Wim can collect a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj's team includes Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, Raj can collect a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\nFinally, I compare the totals from both teams to determine which manager to meet with.
