The number of books they donate is 10 (from Nisha) + 50 (from Reza), which equals 60 books.\n\nComparing these totals, the team led by Wim is donating more books. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, one should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
