Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

One path is through Wim and the other is through Raj.\n3. For Wim's path, we add the books donated by Jing (56 books) and Wei (22 books), for a total of 78 books.\n4. For Raj's path, we add the books donated by Nisha (10 books) and Reza (50 books), for a total of 60 books.\n5. Comparing these two totals, we see that we can get more books from Wim's path (78 books) than from Raj's path (60 books).\n6.
