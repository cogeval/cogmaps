Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Amir -> Raj -> Nisha + Reza: The total books on this path is 10 (Nisha) + 50 (Reza) = 60 books.\n\nBy comparing the totals, it's clear that going through Wim yields more books.
