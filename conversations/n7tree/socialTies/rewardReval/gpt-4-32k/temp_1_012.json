Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

There are two paths starting from Amir:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim -> Jing/Wei \n2. Amir -> Raj -> Nisha/Reza\n\nCalculate the total books donated by each path. For the first path, Jing and Wei collectively donate 56+22=78 books. For the second path, Nisha and Reza donate 10+50=60 books. \n\nStep 3: Compare the totals to determine the path with the maximum number of books. The first path through Wim, Jing, and Wei has more books (78) compared to the second path through Raj, Nisha, and Reza (60).\n\nStep 4: Formulate the final response. The names should be in order: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
