The maximum number of books is obtained when choosing the path with the salesperson who is donating the highest number of books. \n\nHere are the potential paths and their total books: \n\n- Amir, Wim, Jing: Total books = 56\n- Amir, Wim, Wei: Total books = 22\n- Amir, Raj, Nisha: Total books = 10\n- Amir, Raj, Reza: Total books = 50\n\nBy comparing the total number of books in each path, it's clear that the path with Jing under Wim's management gives the maximum number of books. So, the sequence to meet the people to collect the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
