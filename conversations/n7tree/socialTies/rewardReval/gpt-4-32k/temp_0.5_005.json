First, calculate the total number of books donated by Jing and Wei, who report to Wim.\n   Jing + Wei = 56 + 22 = 78 books\n\n2. Then, calculate the total number of books donated by Nisha and Reza, who report to Raj.\n   Nisha + Reza = 10 + 50 = 60 books\n\n3. Compare the two totals. Wim's team has donated more books (78) than Raj's team (60).\n\n4. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is Amir -> Wim -> Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
