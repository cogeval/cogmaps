Karuna has 4 rating for friendly collaboration while Bunty has a rating of 2. Anita has a rating of 2.5 while Sunny has a rating of 3.5. You can only have one person to start your collaboration.

            "content": "\nWhat the heck is \"friendly collaboration rating\"?\nI will say Karuna's 4 > Sunny's 3.5 >> Reeta = Bunty's 4 >> Karuna << Anita >> Ramesh\nWhy are you ignoring Suresh's rating and only considering the 4 employees?\n@joshkruggel Yes, that was my assumption, but the problem states it is the highest. I was assuming it was the highest from anyone in Suresh's circle, not just the employees.\nYou need to consider all of the employees mentioned in the first line, including Suresh, Karuna, Anita, Bunty, and Reeta. The highest rating by any employee is your answer. Note that all of the ratings are numbers from 1 to 5, where 1 means very unfriendly and 5 means very friendly.\nIt should have been in a table but not sure how that will be formatted here. Let me rephrase: starting from Suresh, which employee do you want to be introduced to for the highest friendly collaboration rating? Please list the path to the employee.\nRather than 5, 4, 3.5, 2, and 1, it would have made more sense to represent ratings of 0-3. The number 4 denotes an average or average friendly rating, while the number 5 denotes a very friendly rating. So what you could have done is put Bunty and Reeta as having a 3 rating, and Karuna as having this 4 rating. That would've allowed you to select Karuna > Bunty > Reeta, or maybe instead Reeta > Bunty > Karuna depending on your preference. But either of those would be the answer.\nI guess this is my mistake.\nIt states the highest is 100% 0% so 4 and 5 can fit, while 1-2 are the rest.\nSo what you could have done is put Bunty and Reeta as having a 3 rating, and Karuna as having this 4 rating.\nBunty has a rating of 4, which means that he has more friendly collaboration than his peers. So the answer could be either Bunty > Karuna > Reeta, or Karuna > Reeta > Bunty."
