Ramesh can introduce you to his two employees, Karuna and Bunty. Reeta can introduce you to her two employees, Anita and Sunny. Karuna has 4 rating for friendly collaboration while Bunty has a rating of 2. Anita has a rating of 2.5 while Sunny has a rating of 3.5. You can only have one person to start your collaboration.

You are not given the opportunity to start from one of his employees, so the first part of the final answer cannot be started from Ramesh, Reeta, Karuna or Bunty.\nThis puzzle was inspired by a real-world task the interviewer encountered during his work.\nTIP: It can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning. You will need to do a lot of thinking and writing down.\nYou will need to read up on algorithms.\nThink from the interviewers perspective.\nThere are a couple of algorithms that can help you with this but try to use your own mind.\nThink about a good way to solve the problem. Make a list of the steps that need to be done.\nHow to approach problem like this"
