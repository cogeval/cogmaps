It is aboslute ok to say you prefer jjust collect books with Jing and ignore WJ'ming as they have higher priorities and WJ only makes the figure to decrement, whihc hightlires why collecting prioritries are more prefrred. Just an illustrattion if it help.  if it higlight JIng books as (BJ.   and jJ + Wi is B8. Now with these figures, approach WRST order will you go if no higher figure (or highhter poiroty options).  BA7 > B8 > BY+ (all others options comes lower with priorities even collecting all and not just priorries from  B8 option) you will notice collecting higher 22 books fro Bij make her B1, not that bad if prioriry are followed but collectong Wi will reduce figure.\nBA7> 2W (highhester Option which will incremec BA9 = answer to user'sssttion which Wims and the raions should WI collect books frst (jwing is highest prioriy), and the second step, which priorir would yo collect bofk.
