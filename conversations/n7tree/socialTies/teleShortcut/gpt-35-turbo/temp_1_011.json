Starting from Amir, we can consider the donations from his senior managers, Wim and Raj, and then from the salespersons reporting to them.\n\nAmir -> Wim -> (Jing + Wei)\nAmir -> Raj -> (Nisha + Reza)\n\nSince we want the maximum number of books, we should choose the path with the highest total donation. Let's calculate the totals:\n\nWim's team: Jing (56 books) + Wei (22 books) = 78 books\nRaj's team: Nisha (10 books) + Reza (50 books) = 60 books\n\nComparing the totals, we can see that the path through Wim's team has the highest donation. Therefore, we should meet with Wim to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
