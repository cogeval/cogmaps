Amir has two senior managers under him: Wim and Raj. We need to determine which senior manager has more books to donate.\n3. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books. So the total number of books from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78.\n4. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books. So the total number of books from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60.\n5. Comparing the total number of books, we find that Wim's team has more books to donate.\n6. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
