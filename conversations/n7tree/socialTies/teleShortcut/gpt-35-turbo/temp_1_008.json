Path: Amir -> Raj -> Reza\n   - Amir: 0 books\n   - Raj: 0 books\n   - Reza: 50 books\n\nBased on the calculations, the path with the maximum number of books is Path: Amir -> Wim -> Jing, with a total of 56 books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, and Jing in that order.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
