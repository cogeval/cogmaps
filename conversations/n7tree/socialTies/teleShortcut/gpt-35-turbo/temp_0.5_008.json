Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, if we meet with Wim, we can collect a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nRaj, the other senior manager, has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, if we meet with Raj, we can collect a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two options, meeting with Wim will give us the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
