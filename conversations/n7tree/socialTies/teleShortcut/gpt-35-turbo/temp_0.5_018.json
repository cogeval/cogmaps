Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two teams, we can see that we can get more books from Wim's team. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim.\n\nSo, the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, would be: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Meet with Wim directly.\n2. Meet with Jing and Wei, Wim's direct reports.\n\nLet's calculate the number of books we can get from each path:\n1. Meeting with Wim directly: Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. We already know that Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n2. Meeting with Jing and Wei: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books we can get from Jing and Wei is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that both paths lead to the same total number of books, which is 78 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we can choose either path. \n\nSo, the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas, would be: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
