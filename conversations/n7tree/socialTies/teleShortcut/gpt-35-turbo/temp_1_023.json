Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Since Amir is the CEO, he is the starting point, and the person we should meet with to collect the maximum number of books is: \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Reza, Wei, Nisha"
