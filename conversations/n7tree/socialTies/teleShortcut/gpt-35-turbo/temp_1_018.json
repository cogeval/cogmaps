Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Let's calculate the total number of books each person can provide:\n\n- Amir: As the CEO, Amir does not have any salespersons reporting to him, so he cannot provide any books.\n- Wim: Wim has two salespersons reporting to him, Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim can provide a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj: Raj also has two salespersons reporting to him, Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, Raj can provide a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on these calculations, Wim can provide the maximum number of books. So, the order of people to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"

Let's calculate the total number of books each option can provide:\n\nOption 1: Meeting with Wim (as calculated previously, Wim can provide 78 books)\n\nOption 2: Meeting with Jing (Jing can provide 56 books) and then meeting with Wei (Wei can provide 22 books). The total number of books from this option is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nBoth options have the same total number of books, which is 78 books. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether you meet with Wim directly or go through Jing and Wei. Both options will give you the maximum number of books.\n\nThe order of people to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Wei"
