Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Salespersons Jing and Wei report to Wim, while Nisha and Reza report to Raj.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the number of books donated by the team members under each senior manager. For Wim, this is Jing's 56 books plus Wei's 22 books, making a total of 78 books. For Raj, this is Nisha's 10 books plus Reza's 50 books, totalling 60 books.\n\nSince Wim's team has donated more books than Raj's team, it would be most efficient to collect from Wim's path for the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the order of persons to meet in order to collect the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, should be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

Looking at the numbers of books donated by Jing and Wei, Jing has donated 56 books and Wei has donated 22 books. \n\nSince Jing has more books than Wei, it would be most efficient to choose the path that leads to Jing to collect the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the order of persons to meet in order to collect the maximum number of books, starting from Amir, should be: Amir, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing"
