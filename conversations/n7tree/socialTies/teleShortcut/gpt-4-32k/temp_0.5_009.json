Jing and Wei report to Wim, while Nisha and Reza report to Raj.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books donated by each group. The group under Wim (Jing and Wei) is donating 56 + 22 = 78 books. The group under Raj (Nisha and Reza) is donating 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books donated by each group. The group under Wim is donating more books than the group under Raj.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path to collect the maximum number of books. The path should go from Amir to Wim, then to Jing and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
