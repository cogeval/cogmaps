Under Wim are Jing and Wei, and under Raj are Nisha and Reza.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of books donated by each team. \n\nFor Wim's team, Jing and Wei are donating 56 and 22 books respectively. Adding these together gives a total of 78 books.\n\nFor Raj's team, Nisha and Reza are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. Adding these together gives a total of 60 books.\n\nComparing these totals, Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
