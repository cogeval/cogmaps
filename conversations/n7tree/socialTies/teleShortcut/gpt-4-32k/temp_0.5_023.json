Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Wim's path yields 78 books, which is more than the 60 books from Raj's path. \n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
