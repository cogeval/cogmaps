Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

So, we should meet both Jing and Wei. \n\nGiven these steps, the path that will yield the maximum number of books would be Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
