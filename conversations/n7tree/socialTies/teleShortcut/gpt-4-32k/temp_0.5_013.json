Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books that can be collected from Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, Wim's team is donating more books than Raj's team.\n\nSo, the path to collect the maximum number of books is through Wim's team.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
