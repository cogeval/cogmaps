So, if we choose Wim, we should meet Jing for maximum books.\n\nIf we go to Raj, we can either meet Nisha or Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, if we choose Raj, we should meet Reza for maximum books.\n\nComparing the two paths, Jing's donation (56 books) is more than Reza's (50 books), so the path Amir-Wim-Jing gives the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
