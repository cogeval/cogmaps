The structure of the company is hierarchical, starting with Amir as the CEO. Under Amir are two senior managers, Wim and Raj. Under Wim are Jing and Wei and under Raj are Nisha and Reza. Each individual has a specified number of books they are donating.\n\nTo complete this task, we need to identify which path under Amir leads to the greatest number of books. We'll calculate the total number of books under each manager (Wim and Raj) and then add Amir to the path that yields the most books.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of books under Wim. This is the sum of books donated by Jing and Wei, which is 56 + 22 = 78.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of books under Raj. This is the sum of books donated by Nisha and Reza, which is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nStep 3: Compare the totals. Wim's total (78) is higher than Raj's total (60), so the path that yields the most books is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"

The structure of the company is hierarchical, but this new portal bypasses the managers and connects Amir directly with the salespersons under Wim, Jing and Wei. We still have the same donation numbers for each individual. \n\nGiven this new information, we'll calculate the total number of books for each of Wim's direct reports (Jing and Wei) and determine which one has more books. The highest number of books will be our chosen path. \n\nStep 1: Check the number of books donated by Jing, which is 56.\n\nStep 2: Check the number of books donated by Wei, which is 22.\n\nStep 3: Compare the numbers. Jing's number (56) is higher than Wei's (22), so the path that yields the most books is Amir, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing"
