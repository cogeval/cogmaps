Wim and his team: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Adding these together, Wim's team (including himself) can provide 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n2. Raj and his team: Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Adding these together, Raj's team (including himself) can provide 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing these, it is clear that Wim's team can provide the maximum number of books. Therefore, the path to take to collect the maximum number of books would be Amir - Wim - Jing - Wei.\n"
