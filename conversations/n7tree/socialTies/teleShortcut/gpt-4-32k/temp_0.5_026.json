Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books donated by Wim's team and Raj's team, Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
