Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Then compare these totals to determine the path with the most books.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of books Jing and Wei are donating: \n\nJing donates 56 books, and Wei donates 22 books. So the total number of books Wim can provide is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNext, calculate the number of books Nisha and Reza are donating:\n\nNisha donates 10 books, and Reza donates 50 books. So the total number of books Raj can provide is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nFinally, compare the two totals to find the path with the maximum number of books. The path through Wim (78 books) has more books than the path through Raj (60 books).\n\nSo the path to collect the maximum number of books should be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
