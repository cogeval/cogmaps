So, the total number of books under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nThen, I will compare the total number of books under each manager to determine which path gives the maximum number of books. \n\nThe total number of books under Wim is 78, and the total number of books under Raj is 60. \n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, I should meet with the people in the following order: Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
