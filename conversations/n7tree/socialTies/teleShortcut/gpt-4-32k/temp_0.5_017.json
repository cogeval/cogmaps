Wim's team is donating 78 books while Raj's team is donating 60 books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is through Wim's team.\n\nFinally, I will list the names in order from Amir to the salespersons on the team that is donating the most books. This is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
