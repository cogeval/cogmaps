First, I will calculate the total number of books donated by each salespersons under each manager. Then, I will compare these totals to find the path that yields the most books. \n\n- Wim's path: Jing and Wei donate a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n- Raj's path: Nisha and Reza donate a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, the path through Wim yields more books. Therefore, the path to follow for the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n\nSo, the final answer should be: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei. \n"
