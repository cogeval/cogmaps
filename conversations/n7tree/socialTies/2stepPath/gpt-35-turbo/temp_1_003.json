Let's calculate the number of books donated by each person:\n\nAmir: As the CEO, Amir is not a salesperson and is not donating any books.\n\nWim: Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, the total number of books donated by Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj: Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nBased on the calculations, the maximum number of books can be obtained by meeting with Wim and Raj. Therefore, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, would be:\n\nAmir, Wim, Raj\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
