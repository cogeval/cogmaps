Amir does not have any donated books, so we move on to his two senior managers: Wim and Raj. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. \n\nRaj also has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. \n\nOut of these options, Reza has donated the maximum number of books (50). Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Reza.\n\nTherefore, the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas are: Amir, Raj, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Reza"
