Since we want to maximize the number of books, we need to choose the manager who has the highest number of books donated by their salespersons.\n\nWim's salespersons, Jing and Wei, are donating 56 and 22 books respectively, totaling 78 books.\n\nRaj's salespersons, Nisha and Reza, are donating 10 and 50 books respectively, totaling 60 books.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of books can be obtained by meeting with Wim. \n\nSo, the order of people to meet, including Amir, would be: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
