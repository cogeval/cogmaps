Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

So, the total number of books from Wim's team would be 56 + 22 = 78 books. \n\nIf we meet with Raj, we know that Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books from Raj's team would be 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two options, meeting with Wim would give us a higher number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with the following people in order: Amir, Wim. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
