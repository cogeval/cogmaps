Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Assume you can pick one path to collect books.  From Amir, who should you meet with to get the maximum number of books? Please list the names in order, including Amir, separated by commas "

Let's calculate the number of books donated by each person along each path:\n\n- Path 1: Amir -> Wim -> Jing (Total = 56 + 22 = 78 books)\n- Path 2: Amir -> Wim -> Wei (Total = 56 + 22 = 78 books)\n- Path 3: Amir -> Raj -> Nisha (Total = 10 books)\n- Path 4: Amir -> Raj -> Reza (Total = 50 books)\n\nComparing the totals, we see that both Path 1 and Path 2 have the highest total of 78 books. Therefore, we should meet with either Wim or Raj to get the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
