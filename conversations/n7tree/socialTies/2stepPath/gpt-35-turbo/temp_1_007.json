So, we can't collect any books from Amir.\n\nNext, we have two senior managers: Wim and Raj. Each senior manager has salespersons reporting to them, who have donated books. \n\nWim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing donated 56 books, and Wei donated 22 books. So, the total number of books available from Wim and his salespersons is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha donated 10 books, and Reza donated 50 books. So, the total number of books available from Raj and his salespersons is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the totals, we can see that the maximum number of books we can collect is from Wim and his salespersons, with a total of 78 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim, Amir, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza"

Neither Jing nor Wei is Reza, so we can eliminate this path.\n\nRaj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza.
