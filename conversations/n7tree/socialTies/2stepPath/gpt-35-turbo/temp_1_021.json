Starting with Amir (the CEO), we know that he himself doesn't have any books to donate.\n2. Moving on to the senior managers, Wim and Raj, we need to determine who has more books. However, we don't have any information regarding the number of books they possess, so we can't make a decision based on that.\n3. Next, we consider the salespersons under Wim: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books, while Wei is donating 22 books. Therefore, we can conclude that Jing has the maximum number of books among these two.\n4. Finally, we look at the salespersons under Raj: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, while Reza is donating 50 books. Hence, Reza has the maximum number of books among these two.\n\nBased on the given information, the individuals you should meet with, in order to get the maximum number of books, are: Amir, Wim, Jing, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Reza."
