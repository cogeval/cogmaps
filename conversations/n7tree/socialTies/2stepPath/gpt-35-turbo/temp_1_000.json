This gives us a total of 78 books (56 + 22).\n\nIf we choose to go through Raj, we can collect the donations from Nisha and Reza, which are 10 and 50 books respectively. This gives us a total of 60 books (10 + 50).\n\nComparing the two paths, the path through Wim gives us the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
