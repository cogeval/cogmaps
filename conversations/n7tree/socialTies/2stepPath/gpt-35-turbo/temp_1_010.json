Jing is donating 56 books, and Wei is donating 22 books, so in total, we can collect 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nIf we choose to go through Raj, we can then collect books from Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books, and Reza is donating 50 books, so in total, we can collect 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, we should meet with Wim to collect the books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
