The two senior managers reporting to Amir are Wim and Raj. \n\n3. Now, let's compare the number of books donated by the salespersons under each senior manager. \n\n   a. Wim has two salespersons reporting to him: Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. The total number of books donated under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78.\n   \n   b. Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. The total number of books donated under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60.\n\n4. Comparing the totals, we see that Wim's team has donated more books (78) compared to Raj's team (60).\n\n5. Therefore, to get the maximum number of books, I should meet with Wim.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of names, including Amir, separated by commas, would be: Amir, Wim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim"
