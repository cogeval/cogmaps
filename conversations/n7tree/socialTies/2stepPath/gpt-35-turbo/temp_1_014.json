Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Meeting with Amir: As the CEO of the company, he doesn't directly have any books to donate.\n\n2. Meeting with Wim: Wim has two salespersons reporting to him - Jing and Wei. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, meeting with Wim would give us a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\n3. Meeting with Raj: Raj has two salespersons reporting to him - Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, meeting with Raj would give us a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nConsidering the options above, the maximum number of books we can collect is 78, which is obtained by meeting with Wim. Hence, the answer is: Amir, Wim."
