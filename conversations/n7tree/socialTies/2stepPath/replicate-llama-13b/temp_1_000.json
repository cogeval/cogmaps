Which employee's rating would you want to aim towards when initiating your collaboration, assuming all employees are available as well?\nSophia's Answer\nPratik: Ramesh,\nbecause he can introduce you to employees with better (2 than 2.5) ratings\nSophia: No, because Ramesh would not introduce me to any better employees.\nSophia: Sunny! Because her 2.5 is the most unique to any other members' ratings.\nSophia: Yes.\nuser: You meet up with a team of people for a collaboration task. You want to be a good leader and keep the group together to achieve the goals. There are two people in the group - Ramesh and Reeta. Reeta has a 2.5 rating for collabor"
