There are two paths through senior managers: Wim and Raj. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of books that each senior manager's subordinates are donating. \n\nFor Wim's path: Jing + Wei = 56 books + 22 books = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj's path: Nisha + Reza = 10 books + 50 books = 60 books.\n\nStep 2: Compare the total number of books in both paths and choose the path with the maximum number of books. \n\nWim's path has 78 books while Raj's path has 60 books. \n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum collection of books is the Wim's path. \n\nFinal step: List the names in order in this path, starting from Amir.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
