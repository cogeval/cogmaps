The second path is Amir, Raj, and then either Nisha or Reza.\n\nFor the first path, the number of books Jing and Wei are donating will need to be considered. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Jing is donating more books than Wei, so she will be the salesperson to meet.\n\nFor the second path, the number of books Nisha and Reza are donating will be considered. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. Reza is donating more books than Nisha, so he will be the salesperson to meet.\n\nNow, I will compare the totals from each path. The first path would result in 56 books and the second path would result in 50 books. The first path through Amir, Wim, and Jing results in more books.\n\nMy final outcome is based on these calculations. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
