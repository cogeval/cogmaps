So, the total number of books donated by Wim's team is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nFor Raj's team:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books donated by Raj's team is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nNow, I need to compare the total number of books donated by Wim's team and Raj's team. \n\nWim's team is donating 78 books and Raj's team is donating 60 books. \n\nTherefore, to get the maximum number of books, I should meet with Wim's team.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
