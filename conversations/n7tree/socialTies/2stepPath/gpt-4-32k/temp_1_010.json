Jing donates 56 books and Wei donates 22 books, which adds up to 56 + 22 = 78 books in total.\n\n2. Amir - Raj: This path includes the books donated by Raj's salespersons, Nisha and Reza. Nisha donates 10 books and Reza donates 50 books, which adds up to 10 + 50 = 60 books in total.\n\nAs the goal is to collect the maximum number of books, it's better to choose the path that includes Wim since it provides more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
