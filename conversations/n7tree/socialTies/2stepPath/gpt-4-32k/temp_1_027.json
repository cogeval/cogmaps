Together, they are contributing 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNext, let's consider Raj's path:\nRaj has two salespersons, Nisha and Reza, who are donating 10 and 50 books respectively. Together, they are contributing 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, Wim's path would lead to collecting more books.\n\nTherefore, to collect the maximum number of books, one should meet with Amir, then Wim, Jing, and Wei, in that order. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
