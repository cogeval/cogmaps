Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

The second path is Amir -> Raj -> Nisha/Reza\n\nThen, add the numbers of books donated by each salesperson under each manager:\n\n1. Jing and Wei under Wim: 56 + 22 = 78 books\n2. Nisha and Reza under Raj: 10 + 50 = 60 books\n\nFinally, compare the total number of books donated under each manager to find out which path has the most books.\n\nAs Wim's path has more books, the path that would get the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
