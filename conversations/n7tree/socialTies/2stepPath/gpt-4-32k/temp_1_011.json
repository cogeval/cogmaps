Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. So, Wim's team is donating a total of 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nRaj's team includes Nisha and Reza. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, Raj's team is donating a total of 10 + 50 = 60 books. \n\nComparing the two totals, it's clear that Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
