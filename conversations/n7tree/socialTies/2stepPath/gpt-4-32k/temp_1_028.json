Path 2: Amir > Raj > Nisha and Reza\n\nCalculating the total number of books in Path 1: Jing's 56 books + Wei's 22 books = 78 books\n\nCalculating the total number of books in Path 2: Nisha's 10 books + Reza's 50 books = 60 books\n\nComparing the totals, Path 1 will give us more books.\n\nSo, the people to meet in order to get the maximum number of books are Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n"
