This path involves a total of 56 books from Jing and 22 books from Wei, adding up to 78 books. \n\nThe second path goes through Raj and can be represented as Amir-Raj-Nisha-Reza. This path includes a total of 10 books from Nisha and 50 books from Reza, amounting to 60 books.\n\nStep 2: Compare the total number of books in each path.\n\n78 books (from the first path) > 60 books (from the second path)\n\nStep 3: Provide the path with the maximum number of books. \n\nSince the path through Wim gives us the maximum number of books, we should choose this path. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
