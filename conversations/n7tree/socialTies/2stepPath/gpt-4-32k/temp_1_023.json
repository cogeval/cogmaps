Raj has two salespersons reporting to him: Nisha and Reza. Jing is donating 56 books and Wei is donating 22 books. Nisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books.

Amir -> Raj -> Nisha/Reza\n\nNext, I'll sum the number of books from each path.\n\nFor path 1, we have Wim's team members: Jing with 56 books and Wei with 22 books. So, the total number of books is 56+22 = 78 books.\n\nFor path 2, we have Raj's team members: Nisha with 10 books and Reza with 50 books. So, the total number of books is 10+50 = 60 books.\n\nAfter comparing both paths, path 1 has the maximum number of books. So, the order to meet people to get the maximum number of books is Amir, Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
