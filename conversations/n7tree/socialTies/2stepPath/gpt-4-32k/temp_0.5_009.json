So, the total number of books under Wim is 56 + 22 = 78 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate for Raj:\nNisha is donating 10 books and Reza is donating 50 books. So, the total number of books under Raj is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nComparing the total number of books under Wim and Raj, Wim's team is donating more books.\n\nSo, to get the maximum number of books, you should meet with Amir, then Wim, then Jing, and finally Wei.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei"
