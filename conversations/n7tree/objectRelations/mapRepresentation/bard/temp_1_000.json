You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to the tree image, and this time you go to the room on the left. You find a chest; you open it and there's 10$ (but you don't take any money).\n You go back to the lobby. This time you go downstairs. Now you see a large image of the ocean. Again, you see two doors, and you can choose to enter the room on the left or the room on the right. You enter the room on the right, and there's a chest. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to the ocean image, and this time you go to the room on the left. You find a chest; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to the lobby.\nGiven you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to one room to collect money. From the lobby, where do you go to make the most money?"
