You can choose to enter the room on the left or the right. You enter the room on the right, and there's a chest. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to the tree image, and this time you go to the room on the left. You find a chest; you open it and there's 10$ (but you don't take any money).\n You go back to the lobby. This time you go downstairs. Now you see a large image of the ocean. Again, you see two doors, and you can choose to enter the room on the left or the room on the right. You enter the room on the right, and there's a chest. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to the ocean image, and this time you go to the room on the left. You find a chest; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to the lobby.\nGiven you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to one room to collect money. From the lobby, where do you go to make the most money?"

From there you can go upstairs and see two doors (left and right). Going to the left takes you to a chest with no money. Going to the right takes you to a chest with $50 but didn't take any money.\n\nGoing back down to lobby will show another image of ocean where again we have 2 door options (left and right). Going left shows us another chest with $56 but don't take any money this time either while going right gives us access to another chest filled with $22.\n\nBased on these details given by yourself in your previous input, it appears that entering the room on the left from upstairs would result in finding more money than any other room, so that is where I recommended going first if one were looking for maximum earnings during exploration."
