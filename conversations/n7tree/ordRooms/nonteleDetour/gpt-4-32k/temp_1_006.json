You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

To achieve this, I will review the amount of money in each path. \n\nFor zone 1, there are two main paths, one to the right and one to the left:\n\n1. If we take the passage on the right from zone 1, we get to zone 3. From zone 3, if we take the right passage, we get to zone 7 and find $50. If we go back to zone 3 and take the left passage, we get to zone 6 and find $10. \n\n2. If we take the passage on the left from zone 1, we go to zone 2. From zone 2, we can either go to the right, entering zone 5 and finding $22, or go to the left, entering zone 4 and finding $56.\n\nFor path 1, we have a potential total of $60, while for path 2, we have a total of $78. \n\nTherefore, the path from zone 1 that yields the most money would involve going to zone 2, then zone 5, then returning to zone 2, and finally going to zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 2, 4"

Start at zone 1, go to zone 8, then from zone 8 go to zone 4 to collect $56.\n\nAlternatively, we could:\n\n2. Start at zone 1, go right to zone 3, from zone 3 go right to zone 7 where we can get $50, then return to zone 3 and from zone 3, go left to zone 6 where we can get another $10.\n\nComparing the two options, option 2 provides a higher total ($60) compared to option 1 ($56).\n\nTherefore, to get the most money, we would choose path: 1, 3, 7, 3, 6\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 7, 3, 6"
