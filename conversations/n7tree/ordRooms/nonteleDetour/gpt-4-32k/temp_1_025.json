You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "The task involves finding the path from zone 1 that would result in finding the most money. This requires calculating the amount of money found in each path and then choosing the path that has the highest sum.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total money found in each path. \nThe right path from zone 1 leads to zone 3, and then on the right to zone 7, where $50 is found. This makes a total of $50 for the right path from zone 1 to zone 3 and then to zone 7.\nGoing back to zone 3 and taking the left path leads to zone 6, where $10 is found. Adding this to the total found in zone 7 gives $50 (from zone 7) + $10 (from zone 6) = $60.\n\nThe left path from zone 1 leads to zone 2, and then on the right to zone 5, where $22 is found. This makes a total of $22 for the left path from zone 1 to zone 2 and then to zone 5.\nGoing back to zone 2 and taking the left path leads to zone 4, where $56 is found. Adding this to the total found in zone 5 gives $22 (from zone 5) + $56 (from zone 4) = $78.\n\nStep 2: Compare the total amount of money found in each path. The path through zones 1-2-5-4 has a total of $78, which is more than the $60 found in the path through zones 1-3-7-6.\n\nStep 3: The final result is the sequence of zones that would result in the most money being found, which is the path through zones 1-2-5-4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 4"

This path leads to zone 8 and from zone 8 there's a passage to zone 4. In zone 4, we find $56.\n\nStep 2: We examine the available paths from zone 1 that were taken previously.
