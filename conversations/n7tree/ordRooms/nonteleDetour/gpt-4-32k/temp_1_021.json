You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Here they are:\n\n- Zone 7: $50\n- Zone 6: $10\n- Zone 5: $22\n- Zone 4: $56\n\nClearly, the path to zone 7 and the path to zone 4 lead to the most money. But we can't go through both of them because once we pick the left passage at zone 1, we can't go back and choose the right one, and vice versa. \n\nConsidering the monetary value in each cage, the path leading to Zone 4 has the most money ($56). To reach Zone 4 from Zone 1, the following is the sequence of zones:\n\nZone 1 (choose the left passage) -> Zone 2 (choose the left passage) -> Zone 4\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

However, there is now a new path to zone 4 via zone 8. Let's compare the rewards:\n\n- Path to zone 7: $50\n- Path to zone 4 via zone 8: $56\n\nIt appears that the new path to zone 4 yields the most money.
