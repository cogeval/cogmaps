You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

But there's a new path from Zone 1 to Zone 8 and then to Zone 4.\n\nHere's the new calculation:\n\n- The first scenario is blocked so we cannot take that into account anymore.\n- In the second scenario, from Zone 1, we take the left path to Zone 2, then the right path to Zone 5 and find $22. But, we cannot proceed to Zone 4 as that passage is blocked. Hence, the total here is $22.\n- The third scenario, from Zone 1, we take the new path to Zone 8 and then to Zone 4 where we find $56.\n\nBetween the second and third scenarios, the third scenario provides the most money ($56).\n\nThe sequence of zones visited will be: \n\nZone 1 -> Zone 8 -> Zone 4\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
