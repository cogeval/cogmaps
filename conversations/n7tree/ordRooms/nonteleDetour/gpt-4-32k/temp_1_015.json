You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Path 2: Zone 1 (right) -> Zone 3 (left) -> Zone 6, which has $10. \n3. Path 3: Zone 1 (left) -> Zone 2 (right) -> Zone 5, which has $22. \n4. Path 4: Zone 1 (left) -> Zone 2 (left) -> Zone 4, which has $56.\n\nNow, I'll compare the total money each path can get:\n\n1. Path 1: $50\n2. Path 2: $10\n3. Path 3: $22\n4. Path 4: $56\n\nBy comparing, I can see that the path with the most money is Path 1 with $50 in total.\n\nSo, to make the most money, the path should be from Zone 1 to Zone 3 to Zone 7.\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 7"

Path 1: Zone 1 (right) -> Zone 3 (right) -> Zone 7, which is now blocked.\n2. Path 2: Zone 1 (right) -> Zone 3 (left) -> Zone 6, which has $10.\n3.

Path 5: Zone 1 (new path) -> Zone 8 -> Zone 4, which has $56.\n\nThe path that previously led to the most reward (Path 1) is now blocked. Comparing the other paths, we can see that the paths with the most money are Path 4 and Path 5 with $56 in total.\n\nGiven the instructions that you can only choose one path, either path 4 or path 5 would lead to the most money. But since the pathway to zone 4 through zone 2 (path 4) has always been there and the pathway to zone 4 through zone 8 (path 5) is a newly discovered one, the path to make the most money should be from Zone 1 to Zone 8 to Zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
