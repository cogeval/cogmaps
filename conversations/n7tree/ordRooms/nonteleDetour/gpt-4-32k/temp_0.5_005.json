You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

In zone 7, we find $50 and in zone 6, we find $10. So, the total money if we choose to go to zone 3 would be the larger amount found, which is $50.\n\nIf we go to zone 2, we also find two passages, one to the right (zone 5) and one to the left (zone 4). In zone 5, we find $22 and in zone 4, we find $56. So, the total money if we choose to go to zone 2 would be the larger amount found, which is $56.\n\nComparing the two totals, we can see that going to zone 2 leads to more money ($56) than going to zone 3 ($50).\n\nSo, the path that leads to the most money starts at zone 1, goes to zone 2, and then to zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

This would allow us to still reach zone 4 where the most money is located.\n\nMoreover, the other path from zone 1 leads to zone 3, and the maximum money we can get from that path is $50 (from zone 7), which is less than $56.\n\nTherefore, the best path to take to make the most money, given the new circumstances, starts at zone 1, goes to zone 8, and then to zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
