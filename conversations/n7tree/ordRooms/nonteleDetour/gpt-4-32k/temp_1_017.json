You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Thus, the path that will give the most money from zone 3 is going right to zone 7.\n- From zone 2, there are two paths: right to zone 5 ($22) and left to zone 4 ($56). Thus, the path that will give the most money from zone 2 is going left to zone 4.\n\nNow, compare the maximum amounts in each path:\n\n- From zone 1 to zone 3 to zone 7, there's $50.\n- From zone 1 to zone 2 to zone 4, there's $56.\n\nClearly, going left from zone 1 leads to more money, so the path that leads to the most money is zone 1, zone 2, zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

When you return to zone 1 and choose the path that led to the most reward previously, you discover that the regular passage to the zone with the most money is blocked. You go back to zone 1. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

But now this path is blocked.\n\nSo, we need to find the next best path.\n\nFrom zone 1, we now have three options: \n\n1. Right to zone 3: From zone 3, there are two paths: right to zone 7 ($50) and left to zone 6 ($10). Thus, the path that will give the most money from zone 3 is going right to zone 7.\n\n2. Left to zone 2: From zone 2, there is only one accessible path now, right to zone 5 ($22).\n\n3. The new path leading to zone 8: From zone 8, there is a passage that leads to zone 4 ($56).\n\nWhen comparing the maximum amounts in each of these paths:\n\n- From zone 1 to zone 3 to zone 7, there's $50.\n- From zone 1 to zone 2 to zone 5, there's $22.\n- From zone 1 to zone 8 to zone 4, there's $56.\n\nClearly, even with the blocked passage, going to the newly discovered zone 8 from zone 1 and then to zone 4 leads to the most money. So, the path that leads to the most money now is zone 1, zone 8, zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
