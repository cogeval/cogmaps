You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, I have been collaborating with Devin Vodicka on making the Regular Expression module better. I have been doing the PRs, while Devin provides me with the insight and the module's functionality.\n\nThis is the first task to be fully implemented using the new module. I am quite happy with the results and how easy it was to implement.\n\nPlease note that this module is not meant to be used for large amounts of text. It is meant to be used for short inputs. The module will not be helpful if you try to search for patterns in larger inputs.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to implement this task, but here's what I came up with. I use a file called 'alphabet.txt' which is just a list of alphabetically ordered letters. I use the module's function match_positions to determine the letter and the index of the letter. Then I get the file's path"
