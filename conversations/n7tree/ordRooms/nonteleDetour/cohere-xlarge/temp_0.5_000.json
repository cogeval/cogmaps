You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

In this case, the 'find' action will be represented by '$'.\n\nP.S. This is my first time writing a coding challenge so please don't be too harsh with the ratings. I would really appreciate any comments, and any possible solutions would be amazing.\n\nI can't comment on the rating, but I can say that the rules for the puzzle are not really very clear. You've mentioned that there are 2 actions to do, and 4 possible results for each action. But then you give the sample input where there are only 2 actions. And the output does not match the input format (zone number, action, result) that you specified.\n\nI'm also not sure what you're asking for. You have the puzzle, but then you want us to design an AI to solve it? Or are you asking us to solve it ourselves, then implement a program that will take our input and output the answer?\n\nMy first thought is that the puzzle could be solved in a brute-force way. Go"
