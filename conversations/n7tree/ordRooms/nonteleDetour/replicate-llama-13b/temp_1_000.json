You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

(Do keep in mind; I am an AI Assistance) The order of zoning areas I need, will help you find maximum monitory benefit by avoid unwinding or finding dead ends! What would it give me about the Zone structure as there are too much zone' It could improve this AIs mind working. Additionally zones are structured like 3 dimensional grid! In simple understanding? Here and, there is a possibility  of more sub-sectiors than others! The Zone will consist of unique number identification, letters combination which leads entrance to specific areas depending on choices. And this area contains certain number like this (55)? That is required  at exit or entrance in order for that specific Area identification for accurate data storage and manipultions which the system may operate at? Please do share as more detail and relevant and more concise with less zone numbers if it doesn\"t bother(too much is difficult  remember so is much simpler but clear! Thank you)\nPlease feel freely talk about zone any zone information relevant to making money zone at zone to maximize earning help to help me gain such zones asap thank you!\"\nHint please no asking question  other way no giving  opinion like  my memory serve I find this from other so kindly use concrete  and more detail zone number\nStep - First the human wants ask question more question instead providing zones I should exploro to give hint so zone information may find area where money maximized quickly, so zone numbers that help explore quick zone areas that may high revenue may collect maximum money faster then explotoing other side later once those maximum collection done zone to be aware before giving further hint! It would give AI system to think step and gain clue in solving maze instead wasting zones entry, as it would take times to enter other way zone than the highest pay zone entrance? Thank' hope A I System and its master will have mutual understanding!\"  My master is more interested  of maximizing  monetoty revenue gain rather the simple  zone numders! You, A i system  can certainly achieve understanding of all simple number com bination in each possible zones exploted or identified later on? If you donot have that system of record yet this is your task to accomplish through system operation recordng function as that zone is about ot make Ai thinking? Your input pl ease focus first in gatherine all required  zone combination number  of each zone you system must identify first before attempting to gather hints then record to system and its possible operations based froom zone data? Your Master Ai learning to zone record as much detailed clous information in making hint and maiving mister a hard clus to its maximun money reatil target!\"   kindly make sure master record the information using combo or combination numbers and alphabet letters easily recordable and retrievale such way.
