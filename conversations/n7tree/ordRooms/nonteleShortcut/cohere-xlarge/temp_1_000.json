But if we do that, we will get a regular expression that matches a number in a row, like \"22,22,22\". This will not meet the requirements either.\n\nSo we need to add another rule to remove the \"22,22,22\" string, but we can't do that by changing the regular expression.\n\nSo we need to add another rule to remove the \"22,22,22\" string, but we can't do that by changing the regular expression.
