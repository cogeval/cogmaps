You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

There I find $50.\n\nStep 3: Then I go back to zone 3 and take the other path to zone 6. Here, I find $10. That makes the total for this path $60 (50 from zone 7 and 10 from zone 6).\n\nStep 4: I then go back to zone 1 and take the other starting path to zone 2 to zone 5. Here, I find $22.\n\nStep 5: After this, I go back to zone 2 and go to zone 4 where I find $56. The total for this path would be $78 (22 from zone 5 and 56 from zone 4).\n\nStep 6: Finally, I compare the two paths and find the path through zone 1, zone 3, zone 7, and zone 6 earns me more money than the path through zone 1, zone 2, zone 5, and zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 7, 6"

Since we already evaluated the direct path from zone 1 to zone 2, I will now look at the paths going through zone 2's neighboring zones.\n\nStep 3: From the context given, zone 2's neighboring zones seem to be zone 5 and zone 4. I can go from zone 1 to zone 5, where I find $22, then move on to zone 4 and find $56. Adding these amounts gives me a total of $78.\n\nStep 4: Comparing the two paths, the path through zones 1, 5, and 4 leads to more money than the path through zones 1, 3, 7, and 6.\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 4"
