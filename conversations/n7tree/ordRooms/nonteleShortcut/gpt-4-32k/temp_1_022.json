You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

The assistant should determine the amount of money in each zone and then compare the totals for the two possible paths.\n\nStep 1: Identify the amount of money in each zone.\n- Zone 1 has no money.\n- Zone 2 leads to two other zones, 5 and 4. Zone 5 has $22, and Zone 4 has $56.\n- Zone 3 leads to two other zones, 7 and 6. Zone 7 has $50, and Zone 6 has $10.\n\nStep 2: Sum up the money found in each path.\n- The right path from Zone 1 (which includes Zones 3, 7, and 6) totals to $60 ($50 from Zone 7 + $10 from Zone 6).\n- The left path from Zone 1 (which includes Zones 2, 5, and 4) totals to $78 ($22 from Zone 5 + $56 from Zone 4).\n\nStep 3: Compare the totals and select the path with the most money.\n- The path through Zones 1, 2, 5, 4 is the one that would result in the most money.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 4"

So, we can now directly access Zones 4 and 5 from Zone 1, in addition to Zone 2. \n\nStep 1: Identify the maximum money that can be obtained from zones directly accessible from Zone 1. \n- Going right from Zone 1 to Zones 3, 7, and 6 yields $60.\n- Going left from Zone 1 to Zone 2, then Zones 5 and 4 also yields $78.\n- Now, going left from Zone 1 directly to Zone 5 yields $22.\n- Going left from Zone 1 directly to Zone 4 yields $56.\n\nStep 2: Compare all the paths\n- The path through Zones 1, 2, 5, 4 still yields the highest amount of money, $78.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 4"
