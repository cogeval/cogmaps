You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

From the previous scenario, the zones and their respective money amounts are:\n\nZone 7 - $50\nZone 6 - $10\nZone 5 - $22\nZone 4 - $56\n\nKnowing that we have to go through the left passage at zone 1 which leads to zone 2 or any of zone 2's neighboring zones, we need to identify which of these neighboring zones holds the most money. \n\nLet's assume that the neighboring zones of zone 2 are those numbered sequentially, so zone 3 or zone 4 could be neighboring zones. From the available amounts of money in each zone, it is clear that Zone 4 holds the most money.\n\nSo, the path that will lead to the most money starting from Zone 1 and including all visited zones is Zone 1 to Zone 2 (left passage) and then directly to Zone 4.\n\nThe zones are numbered in order, 1,2,4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"
