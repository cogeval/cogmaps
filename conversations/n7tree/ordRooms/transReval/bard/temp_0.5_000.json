You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

This will give you a total of $50.\n\nThe regular expression you provided is:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]+\n```\n\nThis means that the answer should be a list of numbers separated by commas. In this case, the answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1,3,7\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nHowever, you said you didn't take any money during exploration. If that's the case, then you can't go to zone 7 because you already explored it. The next highest amount of money is $22, which is in zone 5. So, the answer would be:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1,2,5\n```\n\nThis means that you should start in zone 1, go to zone 2, and then go to zone 5. This will give you the most money, given that you can't go back to zones you've already explored."
