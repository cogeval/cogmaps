You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

I'll think step-by-step.\nStep 1: In Zone 1, I have a choice between two passages: right and left.\nStep 2:If I choose the right passage in Zone 1, I will reach Zone 3 and have two choices for passages again: left and right. \nQuestion \nHow much I\u2019ll get as an average amount at Left( Zone 1 -> LEFT -> ZONE X -> CAGE, here, ZONE X can one of    either ZONE 3 LEFT  ZONE 3 RIGHT        zone X would   I think in zone, if zonex and zonesy do have the potential to be either zones 7or zones 1 since there're exactly four of zonelab xy can select only once of these, so that reduces choice of $ in zone A if $47 is selected because x equals right but can only  take one left turn right?   \nPlease answer questions step buy step? And explain why in the next Answer section that will explain if money'sa lot, it really does add\nAnswer will begin from Zone \nIf you want me to continue without your writing another paragraph for each subsequent question you need simply give zone # at each stage. Zone and I understand. Then I\u2019ll take into account those zones given the money earned from each zone  with highest probability( as per choice zones A&A or  ZoneBs, B &C)."
