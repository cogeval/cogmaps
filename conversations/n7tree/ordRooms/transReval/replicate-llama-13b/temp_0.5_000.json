You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

After thoroughly running calculations taking this information i am still exploring these interesting points while ensuring cost and optimal choices the way would  you approach to find as a most monetarily valored outcome would likely include? Remember again based exclusiively only solely on the zone of 3(the third point) and counting total amount if monetry value for every path while you try everything which results the overall total to determine an absolute clear-cut total to your goal and what way it should cost and also looking sole value in interest is worth how mhuch of moving to another way of thinking by only seeing caginal choice with its price to count. Your calculations might get intricted with zones and numbers associated with it then after determindig a base amount needed or goal with capped value needed but after collecti g the numbers let us find ot first before this is based upon a base zone(or base price) that can set value for that initial calculation. For clariti i wil summarze first set and base value needed after finding that for that goal. And do a detailed anaysls beyond  that initial summary anwysing th eanws you received as A lass  system then i set of numbers.

After this, letme give sbrief an overvlookf ot thte numenrical answers s i dive into deep explanation, clarafactionz for the first onther details will have you better know the process behind my ansser to see better for all involved while using that system and my abilities.
