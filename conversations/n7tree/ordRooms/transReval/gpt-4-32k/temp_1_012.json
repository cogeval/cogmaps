You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

From Zone 3, there were two possibilities. The first was to go to Zone 7 via the right passage, where $50 was found. The second was to go to Zone 6 via the left passage, where $10 was found. So, if I take the right passage in Zone 3, I get more money.\n\nNext, the path on the left from Zone 1:\n\n3. Zone 1 to Zone 2 via the left passage.\n4. From Zone 2, there were also two possibilities. The first was to go to Zone 5 via the right passage, where $22 was found. The second was to go to Zone 4 via the left passage, where $56 was found. So, if I take the left passage in Zone 2, I get more money.\n\nFinally, comparing the total amounts from both paths:\n\n1. If I took the right path from Zone 1, I would make $50.\n2. If I took the left path from Zone 1, I would make $56.\n\nSo, I would make the most money by taking the left path.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

If we go from Zone 1 to Zone 2 via the left passage, only the right passage in Zone 2 is open, which leads to Zone 5 where $22 can be found.\n\nComparing the totals from these two possible paths:\n\n1. Taking the right path from Zone 1 gives us $50.\n2. Taking the left path from Zone 1 gives us $22.\n\nSo, we would make the most money by taking the right path from Zone 1, leading us to Zone 3, and then taking the passage to Zone 7.\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 7"
