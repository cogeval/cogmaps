You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Comparing the amounts in each zone, we see that zone 7 has the most money ($50), followed by zone 4 ($56). However, we can only choose one path from zone 1.\n\nSince zone 7 ($50) is accessed from zone 3, which is accessed from zone 1 (right passage), and zone 4 ($56) is accessed from zone 2, which is accessed from zone 1 (left passage), we need to compare these two paths.\n\nThe path to zone 7 gives us $50, while the path to zone 4 gives us $56. Therefore, the path to zone 4 gives us the most money.\n\nSo, the path to follow from zone 1 to make the most money is: Zone 1 (left passage) -> Zone 2 (left passage) -> Zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

Since we are already in zone 1, the only new zone we can access through the portal is zone 5.\n\nNow, let's compare the amounts in each accessible zone:\n\n- Zone 4 has $56 (accessed from zone 2, which is accessed from zone 1 through the left passage).\n- Zone 5 has $22 (accessed directly from zone 1 through the portal).\n- Zone 7 has $50 (accessed from zone 3, which is accessed from zone 1 through the right passage).\n\nThe path to zone 4 still gives us the most money. Therefore, even with the portal, the path to follow from zone 1 to make the most money is still: Zone 1 (left passage) -> Zone 2 (left passage) -> Zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"
