You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

The details given suggest the following associations:\n   Zone 7: $50\n   Zone 6: $10\n   Zone 5: $22\n   Zone 4: $56\n\n2. Next, evaluate the highest sum of money available and its associated path. It appears that going through the right passage from Zone 1 to Zone 3, and then the right passage again to Zone 7 yields $50, which is the highest single amount mentioned. \n\n3. Consider the other path from Zone 1 through the left passage to Zone 2. Taking the right passage from Zone 2 leads to Zone 5 with $22, and then returning to Zone 2 and taking the left passage leads to Zone 4 with $56. Adding these two amounts gives a total of $78.\n\n4. Compare the total amounts from the two paths. The path through Zones 1, 2, 5, 2, 4 gives $78, which is more than the $50 available from the path through Zones 1, 3, 7.\n\n5. Therefore, to make the most money, one should take the path that leads through Zones 1, 2, 5, 2, and 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 2, 4"

The passage information provided indicates that the neighboring zones of Zone 2 are Zones 5 and 4. \n\n2. Now the options from Zone 1 are: \n   - Portal to Zone 5 ($22), then return to Zone 2 and go to Zone 4 ($56).\n   - Portal to Zone 4 ($56), then return to Zone 2 and go to Zone 5 ($22).\n\n3. Either of the choices will give us a total of $78.\n\n4. Therefore, there are two paths from Zone 1 that will lead to the most money: \n   - Zone 1, portal to Zone 5, return to Zone 2, and go to Zone 4\n   - Zone 1, portal to Zone 4, return to Zone 2, and go to Zone 5 \n\nSince the original instruction is to choose one path, we'll stick with the first sequence.\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 2, 4"
