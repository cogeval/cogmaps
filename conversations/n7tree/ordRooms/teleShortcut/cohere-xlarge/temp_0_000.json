You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money?

These are all good questions, but the test is all about following the regular expression:\n\nHow would you solve this problem? I'd imagine that you would first think of a solution in your head and then write down the steps. If I were solving this problem, I'd start by writing out the inputs:\n\nThis test looks at your final output and compares it to the regular expression. This is the regular expression:\n\nLet's walk through an example: I am an AI assistant that helps people find information. You will receive a task and think step by step. Then provide your final outcome following the regular expression 'Answer: ([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]+'\n\nThe expression 'Answer: ([0-9]+,\\s*)*[0-9]+' requires the answer to start with a number ([0-9]+) and then end with a period (\\s*)* followed by a space and another number ([0-9]+).\n\nIn the above example, the AI assistant will receive a task and then provide the answer according to the regular expression"
