You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Path on the left from zone 1: Zone 2, zone 5 - $22\n4. Path on the left from zone 2: Zone 4 - $56\n\nAfter reviewing the paths, we can see that path 1 has a total of $50, path 2 (which is a continuation of path 1 from zone 3) has $10, path 3 has $22, and path 4 has $56.\n\nTherefore, the path leading to the most money is the fourth path, which starts in zone 1 and goes to zone 2 and then zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"

Zone 8 has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighboring zone of zone 2.

Zone 5's potential earning: $22 (from previous exploration)\n\nAfter reviewing the paths and the potential earnings, we can see that taking the path from zone 1 to zone 8, and then taking the portal to zone 4 would lead to the most money as zone 4 has the highest potential earning of $56 from the previous exploration.\n\nSo, from zone 1, the path that would lead to the most money is zone 1 to zone 8 and then to zone 4 through the portal.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
