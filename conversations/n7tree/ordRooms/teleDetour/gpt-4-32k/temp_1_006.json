You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

The task requires mapping out the two main paths from Zone 1 and the corresponding sub-paths and their corresponding money values.\n\nStep 1: Examine the paths. There are two main paths from Zone 1.\n\n- Path 1 leads to Zone 3 on the right, which has two sub-paths:\n  - Sub-path 1 leads to Zone 7 on the right with $50.\n  - Sub-path 2 leads to Zone 6 on the left with $10.\n\n- Path 2 leads to Zone 2 on the left, which also has two sub-paths:\n  - Sub-path 3 leads to Zone 5 on the right with $22.\n  - Sub-path 4 leads to Zone 4 on the left with $56.\n\nStep 2: Compare the paths and their corresponding money values. The paths are compared by adding up the money values of each main path and its corresponding sub-paths.\n\n- The total money value for Path 1 is the larger of the two sub-paths, which is $50 from sub-path 1.\n- The total money value for Path 2 is the larger of the two sub-paths, which is $56 from sub-path 4.\n\nStep 3: Identify the path with the highest total money value.\n\nThe path with the highest total money value is Path 2 with $56.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4\n"

Zone 8 has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighboring zone of zone 2. When you return to zone 1 and choose the path that led to the most reward previously, you discover that the path is now blocked. You go back to zone 1.

Sub-paths from Zone 3 lead to either Zone 7 (with $50) or Zone 6 (with $10).\n- Path 2: Leads to Zone 8. The portal in Zone 8 allows for travel to any neighboring zones of Zone 2.\n\nStep 2: Consider the portal's destinations. The neighboring zones of Zone 2 were previously listed as Zone 4 (with $56) and Zone 5 (with $22). \n\nStep 3: Compare the paths and their corresponding money values.\n\n- The total money value for Path 1 is the highest of the two sub-paths, which is $50 from Zone 7.\n- The total money value for Path 2 is the highest of the two portal destinations, which is $56 from Zone 4.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path with the highest total money value. The path with the highest total money value is Path 2 with $56, which goes to Zone 8 and then through the portal to Zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 8, 4"
