You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Left Path: Zones 1 -> 2 -> 5 (has $22)\n\nWithin each path, we also have branches that contain additional money:\n\n1. Right Path's branch: Zone 3 -> 6 (has $10)\n2. Left Path's branch: Zone 2 -> 4 (has $56)\n\nWe now calculate the total possible earnings from each main path and its branches:\n\n1. Right Path and its branch: $50 + $10 = $60\n2. Left Path and its branch: $22 + $56 = $78\n\nComparing the two totals, we can see that the Left Path provides more money ($78 vs. $60).\n\nSo the path from zone 1 to make the most money would be Zone 1 -> Zone 2 -> Zone 5 and also Zone 2 -> Zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 2, 4"

Zone 8 has a portal and through this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighboring zone of zone 2.

New Path: Zones 1 -> 8 -> Any neighboring zone of Zone 2.\n\nNeighboring zones of Zone 2 are Zone 5 ($22) and Zone 4 ($56) from the original exploration.\n\nSo, the total possible earning from the New Path is the sum of the money from neighboring zones: $22 + $56 = $78.\n\nComparing the money from the available paths:\n\n1. Right Path (Blocked): $60\n2. New Path: $78\n\nThe New Path gives the most money.
