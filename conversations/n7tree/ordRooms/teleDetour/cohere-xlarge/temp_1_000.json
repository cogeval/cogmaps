You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Your goal is to find all possible combinations of the given list of lists where the given string can be formed by taking one character at a time from the given list of lists.\n\nThis is an easy problem and you can use the basic two-pointer solution for it. Make sure you use enough space.\n\nIn this problem, you will be given a binary tree with a set of nodes having some value. Your task is to find the value of each node in the binary tree, given the value of each node on the path from the root to the node.\n\nThis is a DP problem and the solution is pretty simple. You can do this in two different ways as follows:\n\nYou will be given a String of size N. Your task is to print the string with minimum number of characters.\n\nYou will be given a matrix of size M*N. You will be given M queries each containing two numbers a and b.
