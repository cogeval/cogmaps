You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

The total amount of money along this path is $50.\nStep 4: Zone 1 and zone 3 also lead to zone 6, which has $10, bringing the total amount of money for this path to $60. \nStep 5: The path on the left from zone 1 leads to zone 2, and from there, the right path leads to zone 5 with $22.\nStep 6: Zone 2 also leads to zone 4 on the left, which has $56, bringing the total amount of money for this path to $78. \nStep 7: Compare the total amount of money from both paths. The path on the left from zone 1 (zones 1, 2, 5, and 4) has more money ($78) than the path on the right (zones 1, 3, 7, and 6, which total $60).\nStep 8: Choose the path with the most money.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5, 4"
