You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

You need to replace every number in the matrix with a single number. What is the largest possible value of the number you need to replace the matrix with?\n\nThis is a tough question. You need to calculate the number of permutations. Let's calculate for the first row, since it's the easiest one. You have three numbers: 1,2,3. The largest number is 6. You have to consider all the permutations:\n\nIf we multiply this number by the number of rows (3), we will get the answer to this question, which is 63.\n\nuser: You are in a room with 4 walls: North, South, East, and West.
