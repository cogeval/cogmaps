You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

We then calculate the sum of money found in each path.\n\n- If we take the passage on the right from zone 1, we enter zone 3. From zone 3, we find two passages. \n\n  - If we go to the right from zone 3, we enter zone 7 and find $50.\n  \n  - If we go to the left from zone 3, we enter zone 6 and find $10. \n\n  The total sum of money found on the right path from zone 1 is the maximum of $50 and $10, which is $50.\n\n- If we take the passage on the left from zone 1, we enter zone 2. From zone 2, we find two passages.\n\n  - If we go to the right from zone 2, we enter zone 5 and find $22.\n  \n  - If we go to the left from zone 2, we enter zone 4 and find $56.\n\n  The total sum of money found on the left path from zone 1 is the maximum of $22 and $56, which is $56.\n\nFinally, to make the most money, we choose the path with the highest sum of money. The path that leads to the most money is the left passage from zone 1 to zone 2, then to zone 4.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4"
