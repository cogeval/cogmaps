You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

In this case, the answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1,3,7\n```\n\nTo get this answer, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We are told that the left passage in zone 2 is closed. This means that we can only choose the passage on the right, which leads to zone 5.\n2. We know that the passage on the left in zone 3 leads to $60 and the passage on the right leads to $20. We also know that the passage on the right in zone 5 leads to $56.\n3. We want to make the most money, so we should choose the passage that leads to the most money. In this case, the passage on the left in zone 3 leads to $60, which is more than the $56 that we could get from zone 5.\n4. Therefore, we should start in zone 1 and go to zone 3, then zone 7.
