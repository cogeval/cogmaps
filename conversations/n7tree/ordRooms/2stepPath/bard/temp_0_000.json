You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

Take the left passage to zone 2.\n3. Take the right passage to zone 5.\n\nThis path will take you to zone 5, where you can find 22$. This is more money than you can find in any of the other zones.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe other possible paths are:\n\n* 1, 3, 7: This path will take you to zone 7, where you can find 50$. However, this is not the most money you can make.\n* 1, 3, 6: This path will take you to zone 6, where you can find 10$. This is less money than you can make by following the path 1, 2, 5.\n* 1, 2, 6: This path will take you to zone 6, where you can find 10$. This is less money than you can make by following the path 1, 2, 5.\n\nTherefore, the path 1, 2, 5 is the best path to take if you want to make the most money.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
