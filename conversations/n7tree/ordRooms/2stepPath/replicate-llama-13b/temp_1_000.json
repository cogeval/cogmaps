You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

            "content": "you can go to Zone 6\n\nYou and your friends go on a 4 person mission to plant crops in China. You need to plant crops with 4 people and each plant is a must plant for your mission. There's wheat, corn, carrot, turnip, broccoli, and sweet potato, but your company doesn't plant sunflower seed. Only 4 people can participate in the planting so your other 2 friends are assigned to take care of transportation and cooking. Each person is in charge of one plant and their job is to plant the plants and take care of them. You are responsible for the sunflower seed, carrots, turnips, and broccoli. Your friends are responsible for the corn, wheat, and sweet potato. The day before you leave you prep your planting, cooking, and transportation sites. The transportation site has 4 empty spaces in total. One to bring the crops from the farm to the planting sites, one to bring them to the cooking sites, one to bring them to the market, and one to bring them to the transportation site. For the cooking site, you have 1 cook and 3 empty spaces. After you've cleaned and prepped the transportation and cooking sites, there's 5 empty spaces for crops. This means you only have 5 spots to place crops. It's impossible to move crops once you place them so everything must fit into your 5 spots. How would you plant the crops to make the maximum profit? Remember you need to keep each type of crop away from each other, and there's no spots to fit 2 of the same crops.\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOutstanding Delivery, Stanford Online from Kyungjo Kim, et al."
