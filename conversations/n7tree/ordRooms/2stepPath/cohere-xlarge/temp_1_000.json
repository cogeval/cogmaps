You see two passages in zone 3. You can choose the passage on the left or the passage on the right. You choose the passage on the right, and your enter zone 7 and there's a cage. You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left, and you find yourself in zone 4. You find a cage in zone 4; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

You can see any area that is currently lit. You are at one end of a long tunnel. There are 4 tunnels branching off from the one you are in. One is to the left, one is to the right, one is straight ahead, and one is behind you. The tunnel you are in branches off into 4 new tunnels after 30 ft. You can walk as far as you want in any direction, but you can only turn left or right at a branch. How many steps do you take to reach the end of the tunnel you are in?\n\nuser: Imagine that the points on a 2D plane are colored black or white. Black points are connected to white points if they are horizontally or vertically adjacent. Now imagine a set of points. Each point has a \"rank\", which is its height. A \"rank 1\" point has height 1, a \"rank 2\" point has height 2, etc. Now imagine a line that is completely horizontal. How many points does this line go through?\n\nuser: You have 3 buckets, one contains 1 liter of water"
