You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

He wants to give the highest possible grade to all the students, but some students didn't study at all and others studied really hard. To solve this problem, the teacher wrote down a program that automatically grades the exams. However, it sometimes returns the wrong grade, and the teacher doesn't know what the right grade is. You are given the code that the teacher wrote and have to find the right grade for each exam.\n\ninput: Each line contains a test case in the form \"C a b\", where C is the number of questions, a is the number of answers that are correct, and b is the number of answers that are wrong.\n\nThere is a MxN grid with some \"stones\" on it. There are M different stones, and N different locations.\n\nThe user should determine whether the grid is \"solvable\" (there exists a solution to the puzzle) or not.\n\nThe input is a list of N lists of M integers. The first list represents the stones at the top row, the second list represents the stones at the second row, etc.\n\nFor each input grid, you have to output whether the grid is solvable or not,"
