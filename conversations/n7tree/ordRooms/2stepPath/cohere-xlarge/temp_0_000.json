You open it and find $50 but remember you're only exploring so you don't take any money. Then you go back to zone 3, and this time you go to the passage on the left to zone 6. You find another cage; you open it and there's $10 (but you don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. This time you choose the passage on the left and you go to zone 2. Again, you see two passages, one on the left and one on the right. You enter the passage on the right, and you find yourself in zone 5. There's a cage in zone 5. You open it and find $22. Then you go back to zone 2, and this time you go to the passage on the left. You find a cage; you open it and there's 56$ (you still don't take any money). You go back to zone 1. Given you didn't take any money during exploration, assume you can pick one path to collect money. From zone 1, where do you go to make the most money? Please list the zone numbers in order, separated by commas."

The classes that help us to create regular expressions are String and Pattern.\n\nWe learned about the different types of regular expressions that are supported in Java. The most commonly used regular expression is java.util.regex.Pattern.\n\nWe also learned about matching expressions and regular expressions. A matching expression is used to find a match for the given expression, while a regular expression is used to find the regular expression in the given string.\n\nWe also learned about the different types of regular expressions that are supported in Java.
