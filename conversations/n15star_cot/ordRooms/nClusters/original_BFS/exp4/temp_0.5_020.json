Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Dequeue the first room in the queue and mark it as visited.\n  b. Check all the connected rooms of the dequeued room.\n  c. If a connected room is not visited, add it to the visited set and enqueue it in the queue.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the rooms in the castle.\n\nStep 6: Identify the clusters of densely connected rooms by grouping the visited rooms based on their connections.\n\nStep 7: Count the number of clusters identified in step 6.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
