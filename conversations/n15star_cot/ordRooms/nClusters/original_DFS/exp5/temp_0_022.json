Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this castle? Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Depth-first search (DFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In DFS, the algorithm traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses a stack data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that all vertices connected to a visited vertex are explored before backtracking. DFS is useful for finding cycles in a graph, for exploring all the vertices in a graph, or for finding a path between two vertices. However, unlike BFS, DFS does not guarantee that the shortest path is found.|endofprompt|"

Room 11 is already visited, so merge Cluster 1 and Cluster 2.\n- Move to Cluster 3, and mark all rooms as visited. Room 8 is already visited, so merge the new cluster with the previous merged cluster.\n- Move to Cluster 4, and mark all rooms as visited. Room 7, 10, and 13 are already visited, so merge the new cluster with the previous merged cluster.\n- Cluster 5 is already included in the previous merged cluster.\n- Move to Cluster 6, and mark all rooms as visited. Room 9, 12, and 15 are already visited, so merge the new cluster with the previous merged cluster.\n- Cluster 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are already included in the previous merged cluster.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of densely-connected room clusters.\n- After merging all the clusters, we have only one densely-connected room cluster.\n\nAnswer: there are 1 clusters."
