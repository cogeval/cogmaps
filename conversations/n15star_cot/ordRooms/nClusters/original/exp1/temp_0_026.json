Combine them into a new cluster: Room 1, Room 7, Room 10, Room 13, Room 11, Room 4, Room 15\n- Cluster 2 and Cluster 5 overlap in rooms 5, 8, 11, and 14. Combine them into a new cluster: Room 2, Room 5, Room 8, Room 11, Room 14\n- Cluster 3 and Cluster 6 overlap in rooms 6, 9, 12, and 15. Combine them into a new cluster: Room 3, Room 6, Room 9, Room 12, Room 8, Room 15\n- Cluster 7, Cluster 10, and Cluster 11 are already included in the combined clusters.\n- Cluster 8 is already included in the combined Cluster 2 and Cluster 5.\n- Cluster 9 and Cluster 12 overlap in rooms 12 and 15. Combine them into a new cluster: Room 9, Room 12, Room 15\n\nStep 3: Count the number of combined clusters.\nThere are 3 combined clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
