Room 3 is connected to rooms 6, 9, 12, and 8.\n4. Room 4 is connected to rooms 7, 10, 13, and 15.\n5. Room 5 is connected to rooms 8, 11, and 14.\n6. Room 6 is connected to rooms 9, 12, and 15.\n7. Room 7 is connected to rooms 10 and 13.\n8. Room 8 is connected to room 14.\n9. Room 9 is connected to rooms 12 and 15.\n10. Room 10 is connected to room 13.\n11. Room 11 is connected to room 14.\n12. Room 12 is connected to room 15.\n13. Room 13 is connected to room 10.\n\nNow let's find the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 12.\n\n1. From Room 1, we can go to Room 7, Room 10, Room 11, or Room 13.\n2. If we go to Room 7, the only options are Room 10 and Room 13, which do not connect to Room 12.\n3. If we go to Room 10, the only option is Room 13, which does not connect to Room 12.\n4. If we go to Room 11, the only option is Room 14.\n5. If we go to Room 13, the only option is Room 10, which does not connect to Room 12.\n6. From Room 14, we can go to Room 2, Room 5, Room 8, or Room 11.\n7. If we go to Room 2 or Room 5, neither connect to Room 12.\n8. If we go to Room 8, the only option is Room 3.\n9. From Room 3, we can finally reach Room 12.\n\nSo the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 12 is: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 12.\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 12"
