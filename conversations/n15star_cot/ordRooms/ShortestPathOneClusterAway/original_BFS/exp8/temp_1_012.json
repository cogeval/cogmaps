Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Dequeue the front element from the queue (e.g., (1, [1]) at first).\n  b. Check if the dequeued room is the destination (room 12). If it is, return the path taken to reach it.\n  c. Otherwise, check the dequeued room's neighbors and enqueue them if they haven't been visited before. Update the path taken so far accordingly.\n  d. Add the dequeued room to the visited rooms list.\n  e. Repeat steps 4a to 4d until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\n\nStep 5: If the destination is found, return the shortest path taken. Otherwise, return that there is no valid path.\n\nFollowing the BFS algorithm loop:\n\n- First, we enqueue (1, [1]).\n- Then, we dequeue (1, [1]) and check its neighbors: 7, 10, 13, and 11. Since none of these are the destination, we enqueue (7, [1, 7]), (10, [1, 10]), (13, [1, 13]), and (11, [1, 11]) and add room 1 to the visited rooms list.\n- Now, we dequeue (7, [1, 7]) and check its neighbors: 1, 10, 13, and 4. Rooms 1 and 7 have been visited, so we don't enqueue them. We enqueue (10, [1, 7, 10]), (13, [1, 7, 13]), and (4, [1, 7, 4]).

We enqueue (13, [1, 10, 13]) and (4, [1, 10, 4]). Room 10 is added to the visited list.\n- Next, we dequeue (13, [1, 13]) and check its neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 4, and 15.

Rooms 13 and 15 have been visited, so we don't enqueue them. We enqueue (12, [1, 13, 15, 12]) and (9, [1, 13, 15, 9]).
