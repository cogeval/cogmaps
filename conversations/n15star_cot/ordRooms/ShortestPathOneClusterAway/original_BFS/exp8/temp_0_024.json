Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Since room 1 and room 13 have already been visited, we only add room 10 and room 4 to the queue.\n\nStep 7: Continue the BFS algorithm by dequeuing the next element (room 10) and exploring its connected rooms (room 1, room 7, room 13, room 4). All these rooms have been visited, so we don't add any new rooms to the queue.\n\nStep 8: Dequeue the next element (room 13) and explore its connected rooms (room 1, room 7, room 10, room 4, room 15). All these rooms except room 15 have been visited, so we add room 15 to the queue.\n\nStep 9: Dequeue the next element (room 11) and explore its connected rooms (room 1, room 2, room 5, room 8, room 14). Since room 1 has already been visited, we only add room 2, room 5, room 8, and room 14 to the queue.\n\nStep 10: Dequeue the next element (room 4) and explore its connected rooms (room 7, room 10, room 13, room 15).

Since room 4 and room 13 have already been visited, we only add room 6, room 9, and room 12 to the queue.\n\nStep 12: Dequeue the next element (room 2) and explore its connected rooms (room 5, room 8, room 11, room 14). All these rooms have been visited, so we don't add any new rooms to the queue.\n\nStep 13: Dequeue the next element (room 5) and explore its connected rooms (room 2, room 8, room 11, room 14). All these rooms have been visited, so we don't add any new rooms to the queue.\n\nStep 14: Dequeue the next element (room 8) and explore its connected rooms (room 5, room 2, room 11, room 14, room 3, room 6). Since room 5, room 2, room 11, and room 14 have already been visited, we only add room 3 and room 6 to the queue.\n\nStep 15: Dequeue the next element (room 14) and explore its connected rooms (room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11). All these rooms have been visited, so we don't add any new rooms to the queue.\n\nStep 16: Dequeue the next element (room 6) and explore its connected rooms (room 3, room 9, room 12, room 15, room 8). Since room 3, room 9, room 12, and room 15 have already been visited, we only add room 8 to the queue.\n\nStep 17: Dequeue the next element (room 9) and explore its connected rooms (room 6, room 12, room 15). Since room 6 and room 15 have already been visited, we only add room 12 to the queue.\n\nStep 18: Dequeue the next element (room 12), which is the destination. The shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is found.\n\nStep 19: Trace back the path from room 12 to room 1: room 12 -> room 15 -> room 13 -> room 1.\n\nAnswer: 1, 13, 15, 12"
