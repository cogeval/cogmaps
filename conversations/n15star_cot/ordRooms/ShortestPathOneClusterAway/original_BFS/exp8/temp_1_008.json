Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Since it doesn't connect to room 12, move on to the next room in the queue.\n\nStep 7: Dequeue room 10 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 10 is connected to room 13, which is not the destination. Move on to the next room.\n\nStep 8: Dequeue room 13 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 13 is connected to room 10, which we've already visited, so move on to the next room.\n\nStep 9: Dequeue room 11 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 11 is connected to room 14.\n\nStep 10: Add room 14 to the queue.\n\nStep 11: Dequeue room 14 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 14 is connected to room 8.\n\nStep 12: Add room 8 to the queue.\n\nStep 13: Dequeue room 8 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 8 is connected to room 3, room 6, and room 9.\n\nStep 14: Add room 3, room 6, and room 9 to the queue.\n\nStep 15: Dequeue room 3, room 6, and room 9 from the queue one at a time, adding them to the visited rooms list and checking their connections. None of these rooms connect to room 12.\n\nStep 16: Dequeue room 9 again from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 9 is connected to room 12.\n\nStep 17: Dequeue room 12 from the queue, add it to the visited rooms list, and check its connections. Room 12 is the destination.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is room 1 -> room 11 -> room 14 -> room 8 -> room 9 -> room 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8, 9, 12"
