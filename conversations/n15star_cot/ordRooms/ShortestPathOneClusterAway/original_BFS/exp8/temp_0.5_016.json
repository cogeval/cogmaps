Room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 3, room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8 are all connected to each other. Room 4, room 7, room 10, room 13, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14 are connected to each other. Room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 7, room 10, and room 13 are connected to each other. Room 8 is connected to room 14. Room 9, room 12 and room 15 are connected to each other. Room 10 is connected to room 13. Room 11 is connected to room 14. Room 12 is connected to room 15. What is the shortest path from room 1 to room 12? Please list the room numbers in order, separated by commas. Think carefully before you respond. You can try using Breadth-first search (BFS), it is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. In BFS, vertices are visited in layers, where the vertices at distance 1 from the source vertex are visited first, followed by the vertices at distance 2, and so on. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited, and it ensures that no vertex is visited more than once. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, or for exploring all the vertices in a graph.|endofprompt|"

Since room 1 and room 7 have already been visited, only room 4 and room 13 are added to the queue.\n\nStep 9: Dequeue room 10 and examine its connected rooms (room 1, room 7, room 13, room 4, and room 10). Since rooms 1, 7, 10, and 13 have already been visited, only room 4 is added to the queue.\n\nStep 10: Dequeue room 13 and examine its connected rooms (room 1, room 7, room 10, room 4, and room 13).

Since rooms 7, 10, and 4 have already been visited, no rooms are added to the queue.\n\nStep 14: Dequeue room 2 and examine its connected rooms (room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14). Since room 11 has already been visited, only rooms 5, 8, and 14 are added to the queue.\n\nStep 15: Dequeue room 5 and examine its connected rooms (room 2, room 8, room 11, and room 14). Since rooms 2, 8, and 11 have already been visited, only room 14 is added to the queue.\n\nStep 16: Dequeue room 8 and examine its connected rooms (room 2, room 5, room 11, room 14, room 3, room 6, and room 9). Since rooms 2, 5, 11, and 14 have already been visited, only rooms 3, 6, and 9 are added to the queue.\n\nStep 17: Dequeue room 14 and examine its connected rooms (room 2, room 5, room 8, room 11, and room 14). Since rooms 2, 5, 8, and 11 have already been visited, no rooms are added to the queue.\n\nStep 18: Dequeue room 15 and examine its connected rooms (room 4, room 6, room 9, and room 12). Since room 4 has already been visited, only rooms 6, 9, and 12 are added to the queue.\n\nStep 19: Dequeue room 3 and examine its connected rooms (room 6, room 9, room 12, and room 8).

Since rooms 3, 6, 12, and 15 have already been visited, no rooms are added to the queue.\n\nStep 22: Dequeue room 12 (the target room) and backtrack to find the shortest path from room 1.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 12.\n\nAnswer: 1, 11, 14, 8, 3, 12"
