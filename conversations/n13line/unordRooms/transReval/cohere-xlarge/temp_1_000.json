You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

User needs to search for the nearest public transportation spot to get there. Since we don't have offerings outside Delhi or I don't know about the places wherever user parks their car manually.\nFunctional design flow\n1 Start by adding three inputs, but remains as toggles as we need not use it\n2 Add an on/off switch for GPS whenever user wants. But again keep it as a toggle.\n3 Use that GPS location to get the bus and metro route from the backend.\n4 Show that results (from backend) in an interactive way. The flow will be similar to the autosuggest of Google location while using Google maps. The flow needs to be in white.\n5 put three dots on the last stop of the route if it is crowded with people so they can easily find it as a destination when they reach that final spot.\n6 On routes view also put three dots at the stops which are crowded - like number 5.\n7 Add ' preferrent way' as an option below only with autosuggest"
