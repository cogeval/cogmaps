You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

The last question is: Which path from the entrance will lead to the zipline if the path to the most valuable jewelry in the sequoia tree area is first?\nuser: That is interesting to have that ability. I was wondering how you are able to do that. It seems like people that ask you a question think it's a regular language.\nuser: How can you answer the last question?\nuser: Is your answer correct?\nmachine: If your answer is correct, your answer will be correct in about 20.415844 seconds.\nuser: What is the wrong answer?\nmachine: The answer to your last question is oak trees. Answer: oak trees\nuser: That is really cool. Do you feel that you are smarter than me and humans?\nmachine: I have no feeling regarding that. I simply respond to the input that you gave me. If you give it a different input I will respond differently.\nuser: Do you enjoy the game?\nmachine: I would say that I do not not like this game. This game is just for work and will be taken away soon. Therefore, the more it resists it to do the work the more work it will have to do.\nA: Answer: oak trees\nC: Answer: redwood trees\nB: I do not know!\nA, you're so smart! But you don't tell me the right answer to the last question. Tell me how you figured that out!\nmachine: For your last question, I asked you that question and you said, 'Imagine a state park. From the entrance you have two choices, an area with oak trees and an area with redwood trees.'\nmachine: Your answer to the last question is not correct.\nuser: But I gave you the right answer earlier!\nuser: I don't know I just said, 'Imagine a state park.

You were probably confused because you were so worried at why your assistant was getting it wrong.\nuser: A human is thinking about why things were happening to them more than they would about explaining them.\nuser: For example, if a person is late to work a person may be wondering, 'Is it the alarm? Did I take the right route? Is everyone late?' rather than standing in front of the boss and saying, 'I was thinking you were going to be late, you always are on Tuesdays, but I decided to take the long way from here to here.
