You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n\nIf we choose the rose field, we will end up in the tulip field, and then in the orchid field, and finally in the lily field. This path will lead to a total of 4 flower fields.\n\nIf we choose the sunflower field, we will end up in the daisy field, then in the hydrangea field, and finally in the peony field. This path will also lead to a total of 4 flower fields.\n\nBoth paths lead to the same number of flower fields, so we need to compare the number of flowers we can collect in each field.\n\nIn the rose field, we can collect 10 carnation flowers for free, but we do not take any flowers, so we won't collect any carnations.\n\nIn the sunflower field, we can collect 50 marigold flowers for free, but we also do not take any flowers, so we won't collect any marigolds.\n\nConsidering we don't collect any flowers, both paths lead to the same number of flower fields, so the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [R, S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, C] +\n\nExplanation:\n\nR - Rose field\nS - Sunflower field\nT - Tulip field\nO - Orchid field\nL - Lily field\nI - Daffodil field\nD - Carnation field\nM - Marigold field\nP - Peony field\nC - Chrysanthemum field\n\nThese are the flower fields we will visit in both paths, and the + symbol indicates that we don't collect any flowers."
