You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

If we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and then the carnation field. However, we do not collect any flowers in these fields, so the total count remains zero.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. In the marigold field, we receive 50 marigold flowers for free. Therefore, this path leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

From the zinnia field, we have a portal that allows us to go to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field. Since the chrysanthemum field is the last field in the path, we can choose any neighboring field to maximize the number of flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field, we can follow the same path as before: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, and Marigold field.\n\nConsidering that we want to maximize the number of flowers, we should choose the path that allows us to visit the field with the highest number of flowers. Since the marigold field offers 50 marigold flowers for free, we should choose the path that leads to the marigold field.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
