You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting at the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n   - If we choose the rose field, the path is: Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field.\n   - If we choose the sunflower field, the path is: Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field.\n\n2. In the carnation field, we get 10 carnation flowers for free, and in the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nBased on this information, the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by choosing the sunflower field path, as it includes the marigold field.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nSunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Marigold Field.\n\nThe flower names in order are:\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Starting at the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n   - If we choose the rose field, the path is: Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field -> Zinnia Field -> (any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field).\n   - If we choose the sunflower field, the path is: Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field.\n\n2. In the carnation field, we get 10 carnation flowers for free, and in the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nSince the Zinnia Field allows us to go to any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field, we need to determine which neighboring flower field will give us the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTo do this, we consider the neighboring flower fields of the Chrysanthemum Field:\n- From the Chrysanthemum Field, we have the option to go to either the Daffodil Field or the Zinnia Field.\n\nConsidering the maximum number of flowers obtained in each path, we have:\n- Path 1: Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Daffodil Field (No additional flowers obtained)\n- Path 2: Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field -> Zinnia Field -> (any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field)\n\nSince Path 2 has the potential to lead to additional flower fields beyond the Daffodil Field, it has the potential to provide a higher number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nRose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field, Lily Field, Daffodil Field, Carnation Field, Zinnia Field (to any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field).\n\nThe flower names in order are:\nRose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Zinnia (any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field).\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Zinnia"
