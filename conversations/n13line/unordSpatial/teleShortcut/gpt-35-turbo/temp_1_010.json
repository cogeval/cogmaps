You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field. Let's compare the number of flowers obtained in each path later.\n\nPath A: Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field (10 carnations)\nPath B: Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field (50 marigolds)\n\n2. Path A: Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field (10 carnations)\nThis path yields 10 carnation flowers.\n\n3. Path B: Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field (50 marigolds)\nThis path yields 50 marigold flowers.\n\nSince 50 is greater than 10, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is Path B.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are:\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

Path B: Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field (50 marigolds)\n\nNow, we have additional information about the Zinnia field. From the Chrysanthemum field, we can access any neighboring flower field through the portal in the Zinnia field.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the number of flowers in each neighboring field of the Chrysanthemum field.\n\n4. Neighboring fields of the Chrysanthemum field:\n- Marigold field (50 marigolds)\n- Zinnia field (unknown flowers)\n\nConsidering that we want to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, it is reasonable to assume that the Zinnia field will have more flowers than the Marigold field (as previously mentioned). Therefore, the path with the Zinnia field would lead to a higher number of flowers.\n\nSo, the revised path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, with the inclusion of the Zinnia field, is:\n\nPath B: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia."
