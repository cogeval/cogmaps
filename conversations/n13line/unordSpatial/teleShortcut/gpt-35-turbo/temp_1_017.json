You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can go to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, and then the daffodil field. However, there is no option to visit the carnation field from here, so we will not consider this path for maximizing flower count.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we can go to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. Here, we get 50 marigold flowers for free, so this path has the potential for the maximum number of flowers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Marigold Field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Path starting from the Rose Field: Rose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field, Lily Field, Daffodil Field. This path does not lead to the Chrysanthemum Field or the Zinnia Field, so we will not consider it.\n\n2. Path starting from the Sunflower Field: Sunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field. From here, we can access the Zinnia Field through the portal, and then we can choose any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum Field. Finally, we reach the Marigold Field. This path allows us to maximize the number of flowers by including the Zinnia Field.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, considering the Zinnia Field and the portal, is:\n\nSunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Zinnia Field, Marigold Field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia, Marigold"
