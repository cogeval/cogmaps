You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Sunflower field: This path leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. In the marigold field, you can collect 50 marigold flowers for free. \n\nBased on the information provided, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

Sunflower field: This path remains the same as before.\n\nConsidering that the zinnia field has a portal to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field, we need to determine which neighboring field of the chrysanthemum field provides the maximum number of flowers. \n\nFrom the previous information, we know that the chrysanthemum field is connected to the peony field, and the peony field is connected to the hydrangea field, which leads to the daisy field. However, the daisy field does not provide any additional flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, considering the updated information, is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."
