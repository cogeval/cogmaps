You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Since there are no flowers in the entrance, we need to consider the flowers in each field.\n\nIf we choose the rose field, we will move to the tulip field, then the orchid field, followed by the lily field, and finally the daffodil field. However, there are no additional flowers in these fields, so we do not gain any flowers.\n\nIf we choose the sunflower field, we will move to the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, followed by the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field. In the chrysanthemum field, there are no additional flowers, but when we reach the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nsunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\nsunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold.\n\nAnswer: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold."

From the zinnia field, we can use the portal to access any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field.

As mentioned earlier, there are no additional flowers in these fields.\n\nTherefore, we should choose the rose field and select the neighboring field of the chrysanthemum field with the highest flower count.
