You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, we progress to the tulip field, then to the orchid field, followed by the lily field and finally to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we can enter the carnation field.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we progress to the daisy field, then to the hydrangea field, followed by the peony field and finally to the chrysanthemum field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can enter the marigold field.\n\nBased on the description, we can see that the carnation field offers 10 free carnation flowers, while the marigold field offers 50 free marigold flowers.\n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nEntrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Starting from the entrance, we still have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, we now have the option to proceed to the zinnia field through a portal, and from there, we can go to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we follow the same path as before: Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field.\n\nSince the zinnia field allows us to go to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field, it is possible to access the marigold field. As the marigold field offers 50 free flowers, it is the field that will provide the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nEntrance -> Rose Field -> Zinnia Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field\n\nAnswer: Rose, Zinnia, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
