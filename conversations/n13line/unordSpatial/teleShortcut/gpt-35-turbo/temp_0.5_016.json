You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we will reach the tulip field, then the orchid field, the lily field, and finally the daffodil field. However, there are no additional flowers to collect in any of these fields.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we will reach the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field. Again, there are no additional flowers to collect in any of these fields.\n\n3. Finally, if we choose the carnation field from the entrance, we will only get 10 carnation flowers for free, but we do not take any flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts from the entrance, goes through the sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and ends in the marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

However, since we are looking for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we need to consider the fields with additional flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we will follow the same path as before: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, and marigold. There are no additional flowers to collect in any of these fields.\n\n3. Finally, if we choose the carnation field from the entrance, we will still only get 10 carnation flowers for free, but we do not take any flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is the one that starts from the entrance, goes through the rose field, zinnia field, and then continues to the neighboring flower fields of the chrysanthemum field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: rose, zinnia, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Zinnia, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
