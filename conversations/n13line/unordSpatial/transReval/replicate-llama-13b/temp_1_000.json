You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Following your directions, Here\u2019s my step by step logical thought process:\nStep 1. The first decision facing you is to choose which starting path to take from the entrance Rose or Sunflower filed both ending with Orchid flower at a distance. Both options seem good but after taking a closer look we get more information the path for the Orchid door only comes through tough after Tulip field but no straight option comes to that door. In other choice Daisy end with Herdanga end which goes for Peoni and directly lead us back same distance back what we came and takes us nowhere just goin back a bit the Daisy option doesseemed to be a loop option if want I would describe as it makes one loss their original direction choice we also know Dandy flower will likely has straight way not loop with Hdyrenag options are straight so we are left out to make our move choice  the Orchids we take this route has we believe with in taking Tulips Or the distance at the ends we reach the final destinshent to where Orchids come"
