You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Find the total number of flowers in each field.\n2. Find the path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers.\n3. Add up the number of flowers in each field along the path.\n\nThe total number of flowers in each field is as follows:\n\n* Entrance: 0 flowers\n* Rose field: 0 flowers\n* Sunflower field: 50 flowers\n* Daisy field: 20 flowers\n* Hydrangea field: 50 flowers\n* Peony field: 30 flowers\n* Chrysanthemum field: 40 flowers\n* Marigold field: 50 flowers\n* Carnation field: 10 flowers\n\nThe path **entrance, rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field** does not allow you to collect any flowers, since you do not take any flowers when you visit the carnation field.\n\nThe path **entrance, sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field** allows you to collect a total of **60** flowers, since the sunflower field has 50 flowers, the daisy field has 20 flowers, the hydrangea field has 50 flowers, the peony field has 30 flowers, the chrysanthemum field has 40 flowers, and the marigold field has 50 flowers.\n\nHowever, the path **entrance, rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field** allows you to collect **60** flowers as well, if you decide to take the 10 carnation flowers. In this case, the list of flower names in order, separated by commas, would be:\n\n```\nAnswer: entrance, rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field\n```\n\nThe final answer depends on whether or not you choose to take the carnation flowers. If you do not take the carnation flowers, then the path **entrance, sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field** is the best path. If you do take the carnation flowers, then the path **entrance, rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field** is the best path.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that you are **just learning about the environment**, so you will not take any flowers. Therefore, the best path is **entrance, sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field**.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
