You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

You can't go back to where you started.\n\nAnswer: The area with redwood trees will lead to the path with the most valuable jewelry. This is because, the area with redwood trees has grove trail which leads to a mountain, which has a sequoia tree on top. From the sequoia tree there is a zipline that leads to wildflower valley. In wildflower valley, there is a chest with a gold necklace.\n\nAnswer: You are in a room with a line that extends infinitely in both directions. You know that there is a pebble on the line at a random point between 0 and 1. The pebble is not on 0 or 1. What is the probability that the pebble is between 1/10 and 1/2?\n\nHint: There is an infinite line, so it has infinite points between 0 and 1. The probability of the pebble being at any of those infinite points is 0. You need to think about how to model the infinite line.\n"
