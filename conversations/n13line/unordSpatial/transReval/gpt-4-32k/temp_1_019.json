You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"
