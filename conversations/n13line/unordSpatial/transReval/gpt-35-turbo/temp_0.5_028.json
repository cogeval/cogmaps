You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, then the orchid field, the lily field, and finally the daffodil field. However, this path does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field at the entrance, we can reach the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field. Again, this path does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n3. Therefore, the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by choosing the carnation field at the entrance. This path leads to the daffodil field, and from there, we can enter the carnation field. Here, we receive 10 carnation flowers for free. After visiting the carnation field, we exit and start over.\n\n4. On the second attempt, we choose the sunflower field at the entrance. This path leads to the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the marigold field. In the marigold field, we receive 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: carnation, daffodil, carnation, sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, marigold.\n\nAnswer: Carnation, daffodil, carnation, sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, marigold."

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can only reach the tulip field. However, the tulip field's door now only leads to the hydrangea field, which does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field at the entrance, we can reach the daisy field. However, the daisy field's door now only leads to the orchid field, which also does not provide any additional flowers.\n\n3. Therefore, the maximum number of flowers can still be obtained by choosing the carnation field at the entrance. This path leads to the daffodil field, and from there, we can enter the carnation field. Here, we receive 10 carnation flowers for free. After visiting the carnation field, we exit and start over.\n\n4. On the second attempt, we choose the sunflower field at the entrance. This path leads to the daisy field, but since the daisy field's door only leads to the orchid field, we cannot proceed further.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers remains the same: carnation, daffodil, carnation.\n\nAnswer: Carnation, daffodil, carnation."
