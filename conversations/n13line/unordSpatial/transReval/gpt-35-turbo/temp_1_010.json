You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Start from the entrance and choose the path to the rose field.\n   - From the rose field, go to the tulip field.\n   - From the tulip field, go to the orchid field.\n   - From the orchid field, go to the lily field.\n   - From the lily field, go to the daffodil field.\n   - From the daffodil field, go to the carnation field (no flowers taken).\n\n2. Start from the entrance and choose the path to the sunflower field.\n   - From the sunflower field, go to the daisy field.\n   - From the daisy field, go to the hydrangea field.\n   - From the hydrangea field, go to the peony field.\n   - From the peony field, go to the chrysanthemum field.\n   - From the chrysanthemum field, go to the marigold field (no flowers taken).\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the first path (through the rose field) leads to more flower fields. Thus, the path that will lead to the maximum number of flowers is:\nRose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field, Lily Field, Daffodil Field, Carnation Field\n\nAnswer: Rose Field, Tulip Field, Orchid Field, Lily Field, Daffodil Field, Carnation Field"
