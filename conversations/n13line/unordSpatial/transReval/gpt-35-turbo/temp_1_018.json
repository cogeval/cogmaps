You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n\n2. Choosing the rose field, we then go to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field.\n\n3. From the orchid field, we enter the lily field, which leads to the daffodil field.\n\n4. In the daffodil field, we can then enter the carnation field and receive 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\n5. Exiting the carnation field, we start over from the entrance.\n\n6. This time, we choose the sunflower field, then go to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field.\n\n7. From the hydrangea field, we enter the peony field, which leads to the chrysanthemum field.\n\n8. Finally, in the chrysanthemum field, we find a door that leads to the marigold field and receive 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n\n2. Choosing the rose field, we then go to the tulip field. However, since the tulip field's door only leads to the hydrangea field, we cannot continue this path.\n\n3. Returning to the entrance, this time we choose the sunflower field.\n\n4. From the sunflower field, we enter the daisy field. As mentioned before, the daisy field's door only leads to the orchid field.\n\n5. From the orchid field, we can then proceed to the lily field, which leads to the daffodil field.\n\n6. In the daffodil field, we enter the carnation field and receive 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\n7. Exiting the carnation field, we start over from the entrance.\n\n8. This time, we choose the sunflower field again and proceed to the daisy field.\n\n9. From the daisy field, we enter the orchid field, which leads to the lily field.\n\n10. Continuing from the lily field, we then reach the daffodil field.\n\n11. In the daffodil field, we can enter the carnation field and receive 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, considering the updated information, is: Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation."
