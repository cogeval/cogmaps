You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, the two choices are the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field, and then to the lily field, and finally to the daffodil field. However, there are no additional flowers in these fields.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field, and then to the peony field, and finally to the chrysanthemum field. At the end of the chrysanthemum field, there is a door that leads to the marigold field, where we can get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, but now we know that the tulip field's door only leads to the hydrangea field. Therefore, this path does not lead to any additional flowers.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, but now we know that the daisy field's door only leads to the orchid field. Therefore, this path does not lead to any additional flowers either.\n\nBased on this updated information, neither path from the entrance leads to any additional flowers. Thus, there is no path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: None."
