You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, we will then go through the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and finally the carnation field.\n3. In the carnation field, we learn about the environment but do not take any flowers.\n4. If we choose the sunflower field, we will then go through the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field.\n5. In the marigold field, we learn about the environment and receive 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nConsidering the maximum number of flowers, the path that leads to the most flowers is by choosing the sunflower field. Therefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, and marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

If we choose the rose field, we will then go through the tulip field, which only leads to the hydrangea field. From there, we cannot proceed further.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we will then go through the daisy field, which only leads to the orchid field. From there, we cannot proceed further.\n\nConsidering the updated information, neither path allows us to reach the fields with the maximum number of flowers.
