You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, visiting the rose field, then the tulip field, the orchid field and the lily field will give you a maximum of 13 flower field names (12 x 3). This order was repeated until entering the carnation field followed by the daisy field, which gives a maximum of (19 x 3):daisy, carnation, hydrangea. Following from there we take the opposite paths returning to the entrance. Finally from the hydrangea field takes two more paths which provide additional five flower field names (47x4): hydrangea, peony, bee plant, poppy and cosmea. Altogether the maximum number of flower field names (58 x 4): daisy, carnation, hydrangea, poppy. Thus 58 would equal our ultimate goal and this will be reached from the entrance choosing respectively - rose, daisy, tulip, lily, etc followed later by marigold.  So if we start from the tulip field, the rose field, the orchid field and the lily field in certain order we will have maximum 58 flower field names!"
