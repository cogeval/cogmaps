You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

So, let's consider each path separately.  \n\nPath 1:  Rose Field - Tulip Field - Orchid Field - Lily Field - Daffodil Field - Carnation Field\nPath 2:  Sunflower Field - Daisy Field - Hydrangea Field - Peony Field - Chrysanthemum Field - Marigold Field\nNow, let's analyze each path and count the number of flowers we can get on each path.  \n\nPath 1:\n\n1. Rose Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n2. Tulip Field: 10 flowers (since we get 10 tulip flowers for free)\n3. Orchid Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n4. Lily Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n5. Daffodil Field: 10 flowers (since we get 10 daffodil flowers for free)\n6. Carnation Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\nTotal flowers on Path 1: 20 flowers\n\nPath 2:\n\n1. Sunflower Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n2. Daisy Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n3. Hydrangea Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n4. Peony Field: 50 flowers (since we get 50 peony flowers for free)\n5. Chrysanthemum Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\n6. Marigold Field: 0 flowers (since we don't take any flowers)\nTotal flowers on Path 2: 50 flowers\n\nNow, we want to find the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Since Path 2 leads to 50 flowers, and Path 1 leads to 20 flowers, the answer is Path 2: Sunflower Field - Daisy Field - Hydrangea Field - Peony Field - Chrysanthemum Field - Marigold Field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Marigold Field."
