You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"
