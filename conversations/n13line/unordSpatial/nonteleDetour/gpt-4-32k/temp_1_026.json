You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Lily field\n5. Daffodil field\n6. Carnation field (10 carnation flowers)\n7. Zinnia field (connects to all neighboring fields of Chrysanthemum field)\n\nPath 2 (Sunflower field path):\n1. Sunflower field\n2. Daisy field\n3. Hydrangea field\n4. Peony field\n5. Chrysanthemum field\n6. Marigold field (50 marigold flowers) - regular door is blocked\n\nStep 2: Determine an alternate route to reach the maximum number of flowers.\n\nSince the regular door to Marigold field is blocked, we need to find an alternate route. From the Zinnia field, we can access all neighboring fields of the Chrysanthemum field. The Chrysanthemum field neighbors the Marigold field, so we can reach the Marigold field through the Zinnia field.\n\nStep 3: Choose the path with the maximum number of flowers through the alternate route.\n\nThe alternate route to reach the maximum number of flowers would be Path 1, with the added Zinnia field leading to the Marigold field (50 marigold flowers).\n\nAnswer: Rose field, Tulip field, Orchid field, Lily field, Daffodil field, Carnation field, Zinnia field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field"
