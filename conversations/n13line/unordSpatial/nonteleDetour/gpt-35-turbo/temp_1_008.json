You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, the two choices are the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, then the orchid field, the lily field, the daffodil field, and finally the carnation field. However, since we don't take any flowers from the carnation field, we won't count those.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, it leads to the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, the chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. Since we also don't take any flowers from the marigold field, we won't count those either.\n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is the one that includes the most flowers before reaching the fields where no flowers are taken. By analyzing the options, we can see that the path with the most flowers is:\n\nRose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field\n\nHence, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil"
