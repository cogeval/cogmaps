You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

This path leads to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, and daffodil field. However, there is no mention of any flowers in these fields, so we won't consider this path for maximizing the number of flowers.\n\n2. Start from the entrance and choose the sunflower field. This path leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. In the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers for free. This path allows us to collect the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

However, there is no mention of any flowers in these fields, so we won't consider this path for maximizing the number of flowers.\n\n2. Start from the entrance and choose the sunflower field. This path leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and now the zinnia field. Since the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to find an alternative path.\n\nFrom the chrysanthemum field, the zinnia field is accessible. Therefore, we can take the path from the entrance to the sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, zinnia field.\n\nThe flower names in order are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia."
