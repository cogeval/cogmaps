You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Start at the entrance and choose the rose field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n2. Enter the rose field and go to the tulip field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n3. Enter the tulip field and go to the orchid field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n4. Enter the orchid field and go to the lily field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n5. Enter the lily field and go to the daffodil field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n6. Enter the daffodil field and go to the carnation field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n7. Visit the carnation field and get 10 carnation flowers for free.\n   - Flower count: 10\n\n8. Exit and start over from the entrance.\n\n9. Choose the sunflower field from the entrance.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n10. Enter the sunflower field and go to the daisy field.\n    - Flower count: 0\n\n11. Enter the daisy field and go to the hydrangea field.\n    - Flower count: 0\n\n12. Enter the hydrangea field and go to the peony field.\n    - Flower count: 0\n\n13. Enter the peony field and go to the chrysanthemum field.\n    - Flower count: 0\n\n14. Enter the chrysanthemum field and go to the marigold field.\n    - Flower count: 0\n\n15. Visit the marigold field and get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n    - Flower count: 50\n\nNow let's compare the flower counts:\n\n- Path 1: Rose field - Tulip field - Orchid field - Lily field - Daffodil field - Carnation field: 10 flowers\n- Path 2: Sunflower field - Daisy field - Hydrangea field - Peony field - Chrysanthemum field - Marigold field: 50 flowers\n\nBased on the comparison, the second path (Sunflower field - Daisy field - Hydrangea field - Peony field - Chrysanthemum field - Marigold field) leads to the maximum number of flowers. \n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

The next time you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?

Start at the entrance and choose the rose field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n2. Enter the rose field and go to the tulip field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n3. Enter the tulip field and go to the orchid field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n4. Enter the orchid field and go to the lily field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n5. Enter the lily field and go to the daffodil field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n6. Enter the daffodil field and go to the zinnia field.\n   - Flower count: 0\n\n7. Since the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to find an alternative path.\n\nLet's consider the paths we have explored so far:\n\n- Path 1: Rose field - Tulip field - Orchid field - Lily field - Daffodil field - Carnation field: 10 flowers\n- Path 2: Sunflower field - Daisy field - Hydrangea field - Peony field - Chrysanthemum field - Marigold field: 50 flowers\n\nComparing the flower counts, we can see that Path 2 (Sunflower field - Daisy field - Hydrangea field - Peony field - Chrysanthemum field - Marigold field) still leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."
