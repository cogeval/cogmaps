You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

I used to get test: string not a valid regex. The difference is I had a colon and not a dash at the end of my test: line. The test: line ended on a colon instead of a dash. The rest of the program ran correctly, but I got an error on the test line. Once I changed the colon to a dash error was gone.\nAnswer: Cypress Island because\nif you test the string then its not a valid string.\nAnswer Cypress Island\ncommented Feb 29 by Kara\nIf you follow the code given above it only asks for one single string.\nIf you read the challenge you will see that the string is this, \u201cThe only thing I could think of to do is the string, however, it has never been tested nor used before in this particular challenge. Is there a bug in the code?\u201d\nThe string given is a bit different in the way that you had to follow the path of the example.\nSo after you read the challenge you will have the following.\nif you think about the string and what it represents try to use that information to understand how the string works. Think about the word: answer, think about its string and think about the other information in the challenge.\nThe state park is the answer, I thought so then I read the challenge again and understood what was to be achieved.\nThe challenge is broken in the sense that it was a single answer. If there had been more I would have gotten that answer and then seen the next challenge.\nAs it is, I don't think there is anyway of getting more, I had to get what I saw.\ncommented Mar 6 by V"
