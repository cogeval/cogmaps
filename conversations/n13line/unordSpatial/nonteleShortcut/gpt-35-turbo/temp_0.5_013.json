You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Sunflower field: No flowers are collected here.\n3. Daisy field: No flowers are collected here.\n4. Hydrangea field: No flowers are collected here.\n5. Peony field: No flowers are collected here.\n6. Chrysanthemum field: No flowers are collected here.\n7. Marigold field: 50 marigold flowers are collected here.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that the only field where flowers are collected is the Marigold field, which offers 50 marigold flowers. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nEntrance -> Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Chrysanthemum field: No flowers are collected here.\n7. Marigold field: 50 marigold flowers are collected here.\n8. Zinnia field: Leads to all neighboring fields of the Chrysanthemum field.\n\nSince the Zinnia field now leads to all neighboring fields of the Chrysanthemum field, we need to consider the maximum number of flowers that can be obtained from each path.\n\nPath 1: Entrance -> Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\nPath 2: Entrance -> Rose field -> Zinnia field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\n\nAnalyzing the paths, we can see that the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by taking Path 2, as it includes the Zinnia field which leads to all neighboring fields of the Chrysanthemum field. The flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Zinnia, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
