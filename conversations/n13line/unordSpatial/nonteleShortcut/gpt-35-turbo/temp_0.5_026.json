            "content": "Imagine a flower county with twelve flower fields. From the entrance you have two choices, the rose field and the sunflower field. You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Entering the rose field: This leads to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, and daffodil field. However, there is no mention of any flowers in these fields, so we won't consider this path for maximizing the number of flowers.\n\n2. Entering the sunflower field: This leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. In the marigold field, you get 50 marigold flowers for free. Therefore, this path will lead to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Entering the rose field: This leads to the zinnia field, which in turn leads to all neighboring fields of the chrysanthemum field. However, there is no mention of any flowers in these fields, so we won't consider this path for maximizing the number of flowers.\n\n2. Entering the sunflower field: This path remains the same as before and leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and marigold field. \n\nConsidering that there is no mention of any additional flowers in the newly introduced zinnia field, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers remains the same:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."
