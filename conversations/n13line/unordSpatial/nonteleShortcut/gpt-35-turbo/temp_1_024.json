You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting at the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, we then proceed to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field. From the orchid field, we can enter the lily field, and then the daffodil field. However, there is no mention of any additional flowers in these fields.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we then proceed to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. From the hydrangea field, we can enter the peony field, and then the chrysanthemum field. Again, there is no mention of any additional flowers in these fields.\n\n4. Finally, we reach the marigold field, where we can obtain 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nBased on the given information, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

Starting at the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field or the sunflower field.\n\n2. If we choose the rose field, we can proceed to the zinnia field, which leads to the chrysanthemum field. Since the zinnia field's door leads to all neighboring fields of the chrysanthemum field, we can assume it includes the peony field, hydrangea field, and daisy field.\n\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we proceed to the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field.\n\nIn both paths, the chrysanthemum field is reached, so the maximum number of flowers will be obtained by choosing the path that provides the highest number of flowers before reaching the chrysanthemum field.\n\nTo determine the exact path, we need to consider the number of flowers obtained in each field:\n\n- In the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers.\n- In the carnation field (accessed through the daffodil field), we get 10 carnation flowers.\n\nBased on this, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum."
