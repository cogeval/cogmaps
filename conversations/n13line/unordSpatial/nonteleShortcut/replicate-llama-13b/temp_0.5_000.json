You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

However, you should choose the path that has the most jewelry without considering the size of the jewelry, so the answer should be Grove, Mountain, Wildflower Valley, Sequoia, Zipline, Wildflower Valley, Mountain, Redwood Tree Grove.\nredwoods!\nAnswer: redwood trees grove: redwood trees grove, mountain, wildflower valley, sequoia tree, zipline, wildflower valley, mountain, redwood trees grove, ferry, oak tree area, creek, cypress tree, dock\nI know that it says to choose one path but I was really confused as to what to write for the return value. What do I put at the end when I say i'm done and what I need to do for it to return me some output that it can do. I also did everything that was needed to be done to be 100% for the test (even put a return at the end) but I still only got 75%. Is there something I don't seem to see that I am doing wrong? I've looked through the doc's, but I can't quite see where the error is at with whats left of my code.
