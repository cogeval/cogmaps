You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, the first choice is between the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, we proceed to the tulip field, then the orchid field, the lily field, and finally the daffodil field. From the daffodil field, we can enter the carnation field.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, we proceed to the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can enter the marigold field.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of flowers we can obtain from each path:\n\nPath 1: Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field\n- No flowers obtained from the rose, tulip, orchid, lily, or daffodil fields.\n- In the carnation field, we obtain 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\nPath 2: Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\n- No flowers obtained from the sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, or chrysanthemum fields.\n- In the marigold field, we obtain 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nComparing the two paths, the second path (Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field) leads to the maximum number of flowers, with 50 marigold flowers.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
