You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

Zebra is smaller than elephant. What animal is the smallest?\nuser: Imagine a room and a door. Someone has to look after the room and make sure nobody goes through the door without permission. Someone needs to enter and exit the room. Who takes charge? The door or everyone else?\nAnswer: door / everyone else\nuser: Imagine there is a bank. The bank gives $1000 to each customer if requested, and charges $20 for it. Once it gets the $1000, it gives the amount to the customer. If not requested, there is no way to get the money back. However, whenever the $1000 is requested, it will give all of them. What rule must we follow to get our money back?\nAnswer: Request the money back (the bank would have to save at least some amount)"

If a person goes through easy paths and arrives at a destination before the hard paths are taken for completion, which choice must be made to minimize the remaining time? Should the shortest path be followed by the first person? Or all the paths need to be finished before arrival at the destination?\nAnswer: All the paths need to be finished before arrival at the destination\nuser: Imagine a group of three hikers who start together for an expedition. Each carries necessary food and water for five days, but carries lesser amount than others. If all three go the longest way, they will not be able to return before five days are over because of their limited food and water. If two go the longest way, the other one goes the shortest path until the food and water run out, and that person will be trapped. Which choice must be made to minimize the damage? Should the longest way be taken by all?
