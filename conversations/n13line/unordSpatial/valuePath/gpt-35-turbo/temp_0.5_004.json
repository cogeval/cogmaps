You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance and choosing the rose field:\n   - Rose field \u2192 Tulip field \u2192 Orchid field \u2192 Lily field \u2192 Daffodil field \u2192 Carnation field (no flowers taken)\n\n2. Starting from the entrance and choosing the sunflower field:\n   - Sunflower field \u2192 Daisy field \u2192 Hydrangea field \u2192 Peony field \u2192 Chrysanthemum field \u2192 Marigold field (50 marigold flowers taken)\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the second path (sunflower field) leads to the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the maximum number of flowers are:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
