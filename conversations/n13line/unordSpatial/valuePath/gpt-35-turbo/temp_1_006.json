You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Start from the entrance:\n   - Choose the rose field.\n   - Go through the tulip field.\n   - Enter the orchid field.\n   - Proceed to the lily field.\n   - Move to the daffodil field.\n   - Enter the carnation field and receive 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\n2. Start from the entrance (alternative path):\n   - Choose the sunflower field.\n   - Proceed to the daisy field.\n   - Move to the hydrangea field.\n   - Enter the peony field.\n   - Proceed to the chrysanthemum field.\n   - Reach the marigold field and receive 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nComparing the two paths, the second path through the sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and marigold field leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order along the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, and marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."
