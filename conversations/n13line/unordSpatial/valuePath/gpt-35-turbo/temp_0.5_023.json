You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

This leads to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, and finally the daffodil field.\n2. Starting from the entrance, choose the sunflower field. This leads to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of flowers obtained in each path:\n\n1. Starting from the rose field, we have the following sequence: rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and then the carnation field (where we don't take any flowers). This path gives us a total of 0 flowers.\n2. Starting from the sunflower field, we have the following sequence: sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and then the marigold field (where we don't take any flowers). This path gives us a total of 0 flowers.\n\nBased on the analysis, both paths lead to 0 flowers. Therefore, there is no path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nAnswer: There is no path that leads to the maximum number of flowers."
