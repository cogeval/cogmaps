You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

Let $A$ be highline trail, $B$ be cypress tree, $C$ be island, $D$ be the sequoia tree on the mountain, $E$ be the grove trail and $F$ be the zipline. The jewelry items are $G$, $H$ and $I$.\n\nWe want to maximize $G + H+I$. We can observe that $G$, $H$ and $I$ are on the $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.\n\nTherefore, we can go from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ to $D$ to $E$ to $F$ to $G$ to $H$ to $I$ and the total number of steps are 12.\n\nWe can also notice that if we start at $A$, we can go directly from $A$ to $B$ and to $C$ and get $G+H$, as well as to $D$ and get $G+I$.\n\nHowever, if we start at $B$, the way to get the $H$ would be via $G>H>I$ (i.e. taking the cypress tree->highline trai->mounatin>sequoia tree route). Therefore, the most reliable path to $F$ would be via $B>E>F$, and the least reliable route would be $B>C>E>F$, because there is a possibility that you miss the cypress tree.\n\nComment: I think OP's goal is to maximize the value of the jewelry. But your answer only says: you only have a few more steps. But I think you only get 2 points (if i remember correctly) because you only go for the more expensive jewelry.\n\nComment: Also, the reason for that statement is because i got stuck at the first 4 steps and I'm not that good a logician. I can only see a path to the 4 first treasure, and I wanted to know if it is an optimal solution of if I can get even more. I assume the question is made this way to see if the logic is too advanced for the student.\n\nComment: @LucasArdila, I've"
