You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can proceed to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, and then the daffodil field. However, there is no direct path to the carnation field, so we cannot obtain any carnation flowers.\n2. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we can proceed to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, and then the chrysanthemum field. From there, we can enter the marigold field and obtain 50 marigold flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, and Marigold Field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, and Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

From there, we have the option to enter the zinnia field through the new door, which has a portal to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field.\n\nConsidering that we want to maximize the number of flowers, we will choose the neighboring field of the chrysanthemum field that gives the maximum number of flowers. Since the marigold field previously provided the most flowers (50 marigold flowers), we will choose the marigold field as the neighboring field of the chrysanthemum field.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower Field, Daisy Field, Hydrangea Field, Peony Field, Chrysanthemum Field, Zinnia Field (portal to Marigold Field).\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia, and Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia, Marigold."
