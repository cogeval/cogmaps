You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and then the carnation field, where we get 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\n2. Starting from the entrance, if we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and then the marigold field, where we get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n\nComparing the two paths, the second path (entrance -> sunflower field -> daisy field -> hydrangea field -> peony field -> chrysanthemum field -> marigold field) leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can reach the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and then the carnation field, where we get 10 carnation flowers for free.\n\n2. Starting from the entrance, if we choose the sunflower field, we can reach the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and then the zinnia field through the portal. From the zinnia field, we can access any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field.\n\nComparing the two paths, we need to determine the flower field neighboring the chrysanthemum field that offers the maximum number of flowers.\n\nSince the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we cannot determine the exact number of flowers in each field. However, based on the previous information, the marigold field offered the highest number of flowers (50 marigold flowers for free).\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, considering the new information, is: entrance -> sunflower field -> daisy field -> hydrangea field -> peony field -> chrysanthemum field -> zinnia field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, for this path are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia."
