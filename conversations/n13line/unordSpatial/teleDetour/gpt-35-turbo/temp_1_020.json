You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Start in the rose field, then proceed to the tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, and finally the carnation field. However, since we are not taking any flowers in the carnation field, we will not consider it as part of the path.\n\n2. Start in the sunflower field, then proceed to the daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, and finally the marigold field. Similarly, since we are not taking any flowers in the marigold field, we will exclude it from the path.\n\nTo compare the two paths, we will count the total number of flower fields visited in each path:\n\nPath 1: Rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field = 5 fields visited.\nPath 2: Sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field = 5 fields visited.\n\nSince both paths have the same number of fields visited, we need to compare the rewards obtained in each path:\n\nIn Path 1, we do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\nIn Path 2, we also do not take any flowers, so the total number of flowers obtained is 0.\n\nTherefore, both paths result in the same number of flowers, which is 0.\n\nAnswer: There is no path that leads to the maximum number of flowers as no flowers are taken in any of the fields visited."
