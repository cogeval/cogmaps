You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field (10 carnations)\n2. Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field (50 marigolds)\n\nComparing the two paths, it is clear that the second path (Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field) leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

From this portal it\u2019s possible to go to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field. When you return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, you discover that the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked. You go back to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers. Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?

Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field (blocked)\n2. Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Zinnia field (portal to neighboring fields)\n\nSince the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to consider the alternative path that includes the portal from the Zinnia field. This portal allows us to access any neighboring flower field of the Chrysanthemum field.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of flowers, we would need to know the number of flowers in each neighboring field of the Chrysanthemum field. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the exact path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, we can conclude that the second path (Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Zinnia field) is the only option available.\n\nTherefore, the path that can be chosen, even without knowing the number of flowers in each field, is: Sunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Zinnia field.\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Zinnia."
