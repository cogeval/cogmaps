You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

If we choose the rose field, it leads to the tulip field, which then leads to the orchid field, the lily field, and finally the daffodil field.\n3. From the daffodil field, we can enter the carnation field, where we get 10 carnation flowers for free.\n4. After visiting the carnation field, we exit and start over.\n5.

At the end of the chrysanthemum field, there is a door that leads to the marigold field, where we get 50 marigold flowers for free.\n8. After visiting the marigold field, we return to the entrance.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nRose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

However, when we return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we discover that the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.\n5. We go back to the entrance.\n\nBased on the above information, it seems that the path leading to the maximum number of flowers is no longer accessible. Therefore, we need to reassess the available options. Since the question asks for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we can conclude that the only remaining option is to choose the sunflower field from the entrance.\n\nThe revised path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nSunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum"
