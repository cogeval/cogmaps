You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, we proceed to the tulip field, which leads to the orchid field, and then to the lily field. From the lily field, we can enter the daffodil field, which leads to the carnation field.\n3. In the carnation field, we don't take any flowers, so we move on.\n4. We exit and start over from the entrance, this time choosing the sunflower field.\n5. From the sunflower field, we proceed to the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field.\n6. In the hydrangea field, we find a door that leads to the peony field, which then leads to the chrysanthemum field.\n7. At the end of the chrysanthemum field, there is a door that leads to the marigold field.\n8. In the marigold field, we get 50 marigold flowers for free, but we don't take any flowers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nRose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field -> Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\nRose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation, Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

However, when we return to the entrance and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers, we discover that the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked.\n\nBased on this information, we need to reassess the path to find the maximum number of flowers. Since the regular door to the field with the maximum number of flowers is blocked, we need to find an alternative route.\n\nConsidering the previous path, the maximum number of flowers was obtained by visiting the marigold field. Therefore, we need to find a new path that includes the marigold field.\n\nThe new path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nSunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"
