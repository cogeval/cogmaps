You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, if we choose the rose field, we can go to the tulip field, then to the orchid field, the lily field, and finally the daffodil field. However, there is no mention of any flowers in these fields, so we won't include them in our final list.\n\n2. If we choose the sunflower field from the entrance, we can go to the daisy field, then to the hydrangea field, the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field. Again, no flowers are mentioned in these fields, so we won't include them in our final list.\n\n3. Finally, from the chrysanthemum field, there is a door that leads to the marigold field, where we can get 50 marigold flowers for free. Therefore, the marigold field is the only field that offers flowers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field\n\nThe flower names in order, separated by commas, are:\n\nSunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

From the daffodil field, there is now a door that leads to the zinnia field, which has a portal to any neighboring flower field of the chrysanthemum field.
