You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

The answer is **Answer: rose**.\r\n\r\nThis is the only path that allows you to collect any flowers, even if you do not take any flowers from the fields.\r\n\r\nLet me explain my reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe two paths that you have mentioned are:\r\n\r\n* **Rose field - tulip field - orchid field - lily field - daffodil field - carnation field**\r\n* **Sunflower field - daisy field - hydrangea field - peony field - chrysanthemum field - marigold field**\r\n\r\nThe first path has a total of **260 flowers**, because:\r\n\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the rose field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the tulip field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the orchid field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the lily field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the daffodil field.\r\n* There are **10 flowers** in the carnation field.\r\n\r\nThe second path has a total of **210 flowers**, because:\r\n\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the sunflower field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the daisy field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the hydrangea field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the peony field.\r\n* There are **0 flowers** in the chrysanthemum field.\r\n* There are **50 flowers** in the marigold field.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the first path has more flowers than the second path. Therefore, the best path is to start in the rose field.\r\n\r\nHowever, you have mentioned that you do not take any flowers when you visit a field. This means that you will not collect any flowers from the rose field, the tulip field, the orchid field, the lily field, the daffodil field, or the carnation field.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the final answer is **Answer: rose**.\r\n\r\nThis is the only path that allows you to collect any flowers, even if you do not take any flowers from the fields."
