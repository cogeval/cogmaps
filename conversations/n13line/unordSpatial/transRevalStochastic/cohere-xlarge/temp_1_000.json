You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

The highest possible score is 100.\n\nIt is common that you will need to handle multiple different tasks in a single interaction. For example, a user can ask multiple questions or a user can provide more than one type of input in a single interaction.\n\nTask-based interactions are a good fit for scenarios where you need to provide multiple different outputs based on user input.\n\nThis interaction is to help a user to get a pizza for her. You need to ask for the location of the user, the type of pizza the user wants and whether the user wants to pick up the pizza or wants it delivered.\n\nNote that the user may provide more than one type of input, in this case you need to handle the interaction correctly.\n"
