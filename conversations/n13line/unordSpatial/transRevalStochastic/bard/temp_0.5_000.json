You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

This path will allow you to collect a total of **60** flowers.\n\nThe list of flower names in order, separated by commas, is:\n\n\nAnswer: entrance, sunflower field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field\n\n\nTo calculate the maximum number of flowers, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the total number of flowers in each field.\n2. Find the path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers.\n3. Add up the number of flowers in each field along the path.\n\nThe total number of flowers in each field is as follows:\n\n* Entrance: 0 flowers\n* Rose field: 0 flowers\n* Sunflower field: 50 flowers\n* Daisy field: 0 flowers (since the daisy field's door only leads to the orchid field)\n* Orchid field: 50 flowers\n* Hydrangea field: 50 flowers\n* Peony field: 30 flowers\n* Chrysanthemum field: 40 flowers\n* Marigold field: 50 flowers\n\nThe path **entrance, rose field, tulip field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field** is no longer possible, since the tulip field's door only leads to the hydrangea field.\n\nThe path **entrance, sunflower field, daisy field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field** allows you to collect a total of **50** flowers, since the daisy field has 0 flowers and the sunflower field has 50 flowers.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that you are **just learning about the environment**, so you will not take any flowers. Therefore, the best path is **entrance, sunflower field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field**.\n\nSince the tulip field and the daisy field no longer lead to other fields, the only path that allows you to collect the maximum number of flowers is **entrance, sunflower field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\nAnswer: entrance, sunflower field, orchid field, hydrangea field, peony field, chrysanthemum field, marigold field\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?"
