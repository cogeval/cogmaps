You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Let's break down the problem step by step.\nStep 1: Choose the rose field or the sunflower field.\nIf we choose the rose field, we will enter the tulip field, then the orchid field, then the lily field, and finally the daffodil field.\nIf we choose the sunflower field, we will enter the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, then the peony field, and finally the chrysanthemum field.\nStep 2: Choose which door to take in each field to continue exploring.\nIn the rose field, we can choose to enter the tulip field or the orchid field.\nIn the sunflower field, we can choose to enter the daisy field or the hydrangea field.\nStep 3: Visit each field and take note of the number of flowers we receive for free.\nIn the tulip field, we receive 10 tulip flowers for free.\nIn the orchid field, we receive 50 orchid flowers for free.\nIn the daisy field, we receive 50 daisy flowers for free.\nIn the hydrangea field, we receive 100 hydrangea flowers for free.\nIn the peony field, we receive 50 peony flowers for free.\nIn the chrysanthemum field, we receive 100 chrysanthemum flowers for free.\nStep 4: Choose the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.\nBased on the information above, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nRose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field.\nThis path leads to a total of 260 flowers (10 tulip flowers + 50 orchid flowers + 50 lily flowers + 100 daffodil flowers + 50 carnation flowers).\nAnswer: Rose field, tulip field, orchid field, lily field, daffodil field, carnation field."
