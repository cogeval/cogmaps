You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

Answer: I'll get the gold necklace in the redwood trees first because first I thought you would get the golden necklace directly in the redwood trees and than I noticed that it is first in the oak trees path when you walk to the highline trail so than I went to the redwood trees path. answer: I would go to the redwood trees for obvious reasons as you have the gold necklace first there, and I would go in the cypress trail as there are chest there, than in the creek trail as you can see the chest there and continue from there to the oak trees for the golden necklace. But it turns out that we're talking about the opposite order. That's why my answer was not the right one. answer: I would choose the redwoods path since it was the path for the necklace and I just wanted to know what I should do with it. answer: There were three paths - redwood trees, grove trail, and sequoia tree. So going through each of them and get to last, oak trees would be the path. And in the oak trees area, the most valuable jewelry would be the golden necklace. answer: The one that takes you all the way through, which is likely the oak trees path. The one that gives access to the chest, which is either the redwood trees path or the sequoia trees path. Finally, the one that takes you to the chest and gives the option to take the necklace. Since the one thing we can eliminate is the one path that doesn"
