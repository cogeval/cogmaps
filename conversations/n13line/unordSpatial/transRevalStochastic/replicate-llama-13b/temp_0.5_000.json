You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Choose either the rose field or the sunflower field from the entrance.\n\nIf we choose the rose field, we will end up in the tulip field, then the orchid field, and finally the lily field.\n\nIf we choose the sunflower field, we will end up in the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, and finally the peony field.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of flowers we can get for each path.\n\nFor the rose field path, we can get 10 carnation flowers for free, but we don't take any flowers, so we only get the 10 flowers for learning about the environment.\n\nFor the sunflower field path, we can get 50 marigold flowers for free, but again, we don't take any flowers, so we only get the 50 flowers for learning about the environment.\n\nSince the sunflower field path leads to more flowers (50) than the rose field path (10), we should choose the sunflower field path to get the maximum number of flowers.\n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nEnter the sunflower field, then the daisy field, then the hydrangea field, and finally the peony field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower field, daisy field, hydrangea field, peony field."
