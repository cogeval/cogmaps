You walk on the trail to find a creek which the leads to a cypress tree. There is a dock under cypress tree from where take a ferry that leads to an island. You see a chest in the island. You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most valuable jewelry. Which place from the entrance. Which area from the entrance will lead to the path where one can find the most valuable jewelry?"

The chances of the park entrance yielding the largest jewelry are dependent on the starting position, where that loop is not repeated and the other position is. As you said it was 7 loops in a star shape, starting from the entrance.\nuser: If we were to start from the entrance where there is no path, then the probability of us discovering a path and ending here.\nuser: This is the probability in which that path will be the larger path of jewelry.\nuser: 1/40\nuser: And this is the probability of us entering that path from the entrance and discovering the other path before hitting this first path.\nuser: The probability then of which path yields the largest jewelry.\nuser: We can't make a final decision using the information provided. This is not enough to infer the answer without making a hypothesis about the starting position.\n\nuser: Let us make some assumptions from the information provided:\n\nuser: 1.\nuser: a. A person visiting the park walks with perfect randomness across it\n\nuser: b. The entrance has a single exit and can't take both paths leading to the same place\n\nuser: c. The ferry stops on the dock and it is the one and only ferry\n\nuser: d. The ferry will pick up and drop off all passengers on the island\n\nuser: e. The grove trail is also the only trail leading inside the island\n\nuser: 2.\nuser: a. Each section of the park is either a redwood tree or an oak trees area.\n\nuser: b. The island will hold either a copper ring or a gold necklace.\n\nuser: c. A copper ring will always have a gold necklace with it.\n\nuser: 3. If the person visiting the park goes to redwood trees area first, then\n\nuser:   a. it will take the path to redwoods.\n\nuser:   b.  it can't take a path to redwoods and another path to cypress.\n\nuser:   c. it can't"
