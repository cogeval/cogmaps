You open it and there is a copper ring, but you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time at the entrance you choose the area with redwood trees. Under that tree you see a grove trail which leads to a mountain. You climb the mountain to find a sequoia tree on top through which there is a zipline which leads to wildflower valley. You see a chest in the valley with a gold necklace, but you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance.

In other words, this array represents the different paths you can take from the entrance.\n\nYou can use the command testcases. This command will automatically generate an array of test cases for you to run your code against. If your function has a problem with a test case, then it will print an error and stop.
