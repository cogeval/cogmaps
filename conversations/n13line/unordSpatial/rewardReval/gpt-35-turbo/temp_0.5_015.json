You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Entrance -> Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field\n2. Entrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field\n\nNow, let's count the number of flowers obtained in each path:\n\n1. In the Carnation Field, we get 10 carnation flowers.\n2. In the Marigold Field, we get 50 marigold flowers.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the second path (Entrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field) leads to the maximum number of flowers.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, in the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

Entrance -> Sunflower Field -> Daisy Field -> Hydrangea Field -> Peony Field -> Chrysanthemum Field -> Marigold Field\n\nNow, let's consider the updated flower counts:\n\n1. In the Carnation Field (from the Daffodil Field), we get 60 carnation flowers.\n2. In the Marigold Field (from the Chrysanthemum Field), the number of marigold flowers remains the same (50).\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the first path (Entrance -> Rose Field -> Tulip Field -> Orchid Field -> Lily Field -> Daffodil Field -> Carnation Field) now leads to a higher number of flowers due to the increased count in the Carnation Field.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, in the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation."
