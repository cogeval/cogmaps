You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

From the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. Let's start with the rose field. From there, we have the following sequence: rose field -> tulip field -> orchid field -> lily field -> daffodil field -> carnation field. However, we don't take any flowers from the carnation field.\n3. Now, let's consider the sunflower field. From there, we have the following sequence: sunflower field -> daisy field -> hydrangea field -> peony field -> chrysanthemum field -> marigold field. We get 50 marigold flowers for free in the marigold field, but we don't take any flowers.\n\nComparing the two paths, it's clear that the second path (sunflower field -> daisy field -> hydrangea field -> peony field -> chrysanthemum field -> marigold field) leads to the maximum number of flowers, with 50 marigold flowers.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: sunflower, daisy, hydrangea, peony, chrysanthemum, marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold"

You are also told that from the chrysanthemum field, when one enters the marigold field the number of marigolds is same as before.

Starting from the entrance, we have two choices: the rose field and the sunflower field.\n2. If we choose the rose field, the sequence would be: rose field -> tulip field -> orchid field -> lily field -> daffodil field -> carnation field. In the carnation field, we now get 60 carnations.\n3. If we choose the sunflower field, the sequence would be: sunflower field -> daisy field -> hydrangea field -> peony field -> chrysanthemum field -> marigold field.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the first path (rose field -> tulip field -> orchid field -> lily field -> daffodil field -> carnation field) now leads to more flowers due to the additional 60 carnations obtained in the carnation field.\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, separated by commas, for the path that leads to the maximum number of flowers are: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Daffodil, Carnation"
