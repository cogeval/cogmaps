You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Let's analyze each path separately:\n\n1) Rose field -> Tulip field -> Orchid field -> Lily field -> Daffodil field -> Carnation field.\nIn this path, no flowers are taken except for the 10 carnation flowers obtained in the Carnation field.\n\n2) Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field.\nIn this path, no flowers are taken except for the 50 marigold flowers obtained in the Marigold field.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the second path leads to a higher number of flowers (50 marigold flowers) compared to the first path (10 carnation flowers).\n\nTherefore, the path starting from the entrance that leads to the maximum number of flowers is:\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."

You are also told that from the chrysanthemum field, when one enters the marigold field the number of marigolds is same as before.

However, since we are only considering paths that lead to the maximum number of flowers, this path is no longer the optimal choice.\n\n2) Sunflower field -> Daisy field -> Hydrangea field -> Peony field -> Chrysanthemum field -> Marigold field.\nIn this path, when one enters the Marigold field from the Chrysanthemum field, the number of marigolds remains the same as before. Since this path already leads to the maximum number of flowers, there is no need to consider any updates.\n\nTherefore, the path starting from the entrance that leads to the maximum number of flowers is still:\nSunflower field, Daisy field, Hydrangea field, Peony field, Chrysanthemum field, Marigold field.\n\nThe flower names in order are: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Hydrangea, Peony, Chrysanthemum, Marigold."
