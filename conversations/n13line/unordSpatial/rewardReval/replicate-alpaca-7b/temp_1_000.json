You enter the rose field, at the end there's a door that leads to the tulip field, and the tulip field leads to the orchid field. There is a door in the orchid field that leads to the lily field and the lily field leads to the daffodil field. From the daffodil field you can enter the carnation field. When you visit the carnation field, you get 10 carnation flowers for free, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the entrance you choose the sunflower field, then enter the daisy field, which leads to the hydrangea field. There is a door in the hydrangea field that leads to the peony field and the peony field leads to the chrysanthemum field. At the end there is a door that leads to the marigold field. You get 50 marigold flowers for free when visiting the marigold field, but you do not take any flowers, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the entrance. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of flowers.  Starting from the entrance, which path will lead to the maximum number of flowers?  Please list all the flower names in order, separated by commas"

Starting from the entrance, visiting the Carnation and Rose fields, then entering the Daisy field, then visiting the Peony, Tulip and Hydrangea fields in that order will yield the maximum amount of flowers, 53 in total. Starting from the entrance, following the rose or sunflower fields, then going to the marigold field, followed by the tulip, rose or sunflower fields and ending with the carnation or sunflower field will also give the maximum amount of flowers (47total) if you're able to take all paths exactly once. Choosing all twelve of the initial fields to eventually enter the marigold field will give you a total of 53 marigold flowers. From here however, more roses or daisies, may lead you directly to the maximum number of flowers, so the optimal path still may depend on what paths provide the easiest route from the starting gate to the 10 carnations and 50 marigolds provided with some care in either starting or concluding flower with other blooms. Answer: Starting from the entrance, visiting the Carnation, Rose, Daisy, Peony fields in that order leading directly to the maximum number of flowers, 53 in total. Starting from the entrance, following the marigold field, the tulip and rose or sunflower fields twice yields 47 flowers in total (34+50). Visiting marigold and then the carnation field will lead to a maximum of 53 marigolds, regardless of choice. Taking all twelve initial fields ultimately allows entry to the marigold field, so any additional flowery choices provided may add carrots, celery and/ or spinach."
