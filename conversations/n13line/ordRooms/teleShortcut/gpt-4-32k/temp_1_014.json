From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

Therefore, Path 1b would lead us to Room 12 through the portal.\n\nStep 4: Compare the amounts of money in the final rooms to determine the path that leads to the most money.\nRoom 11 (Path 1a): 10 dollars\nRoom 12 (Path 1b): 50 dollars\nRoom 12 (Path 2): 50 dollars\n\nSince Room 12 has 50 dollars, which is greater than the 10 dollars in Room 11, the paths that lead to the most money are Path 1b and Path 2. However, since the task is to choose only one path, and Path 1b provides a quicker and more flexible route to Room 12 through the portal, we will choose Path 1b.\n\nAnswer: 1, 14, 12"
