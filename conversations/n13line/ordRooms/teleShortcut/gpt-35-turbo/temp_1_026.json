From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

However, we need to calculate the total money obtained in each path to determine which one leads to the most money. \n\nThe first path only has 10 dollars in Room 12. The second path has a total of 50 dollars in Room 12 and an additional 10 dollars in Room 11, which we can grab on our way to Room 12.
