At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

The neighbouring rooms of room 10 are room 8 and room 12.\n\nTherefore, the possible paths that may lead us to more money are:\n\n1.
