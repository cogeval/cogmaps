You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"

Alternatively, if you take the more subtle approach, starting at the lobby and choosing random you will also get roughly the same amount with a variance of plus or minus a couple of dollars. For example, randomly choosing 1 or 12 from the lobby followed by going to 6, 4, 5, or 7 and then opening the door in any of the previously mentioned rooms will lead to the chest with 70 dollars.  Alternatively, If you wanted to get the majority of the money possible (85 dollars + change possible) then starting at the lobby one could choose to visit room 1 or 10 following a predictable pattern of visiting every odd numbered room twice, excluding room 9 where to enter will require visiting room 4 first.  Thus, room ordering would be: 1,3,5,8,4,12 without making any deviations (once visitor passes through room twice, they must not revisit that same room to get maximum amount), thus leading to a possible total of 85 dollars - plus some amount in change that can't exceed +/-3 dollars, while following the opposite 11,9 approach allows reach a maximum  of only $71 dollars with any additional dollar beyond not guaranteed and might result in significantly shorter route leading up to 71 dollars."
