From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment.

At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

You are in the \" Lobby\", You have Two doors : ( Room_1,Room_2),right?, Is it correct!?\"\nQuestion: Which path will lead a maximum amount of money if given scenarios? And in that lobby with one enterance and all directions will you have option either a single path to  more multiple (choiscible) choices! so give output and steps, all  the inputs I have mentioned all this detail you want right clarity answer for the final path and all details please ask questions!  Go ahead give ouput final Path and steps so its complete  answers please. Give answers with appropriate inditing ion so  that you have path from Room 1 or 2 and ending of path should have mention final result total amount dollars in it and so with steps to how it will comes till the results! Thats What want clear path ending to desired endresult! Understand! please guide in giving final Path Steps and Answers Please go  A head, ask me if you further Question clarity, I ll Clear U r point. Thankyou!)\"\n(Discourse is using bullet points)\nHere's how my mind would work behind solving path in lobbyg, it just as a game it sounds like there are possibilities and rooms that is the starting node where we should take a right choice in shortest way to our desined(defined?) output the goal/path with answers as described and wanted results and outcomes I'd calculate steps, then work from where user enters the scenario steps which the possible inputs in bullet as it shows we hve these! If i  were entering that game and trying path out in which steps would guide me for max output! And so if the total result as mentioned of  dollars say!\nGive answer clarity of steps(Paths/Doors, entered by ur choose of room2 instead of Room one.) \nAnswer:([1,]())*([9,8], [)$15\nsteps!   I shall be taking you through that maze stepbystep through that door(input entered!) and  as user, and guiedng with max results and so \nThese rooms!  Each having these doors will guiuide one another so u see here all input given step number one is clear you understand? Please clarify with one confirmation question!\" before diving steps below."
