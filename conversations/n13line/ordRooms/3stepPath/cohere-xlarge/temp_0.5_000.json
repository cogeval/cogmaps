From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment.

At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

I was able to figure out what it is and the meaning of the question. It was a really great experience.\n\nI found this course really helpful in learning about RegEx. It helped me to understand what the regular expression does and how it works. It also helped me to understand how to use regular expressions to solve real-world problems.\n\nThere were many topics that I did not know about before taking this course. For example, I did not know about the difference between a regular expression and a string, and I did not know about the difference between a string and a list. I also did not know about the difference between a string and a list, and I did not know about the difference between a list and a map. I also did not know about the difference between a list and a map.\n\nI liked the practice exercises. I think they were a good way to learn about the topics. I liked that the exercises were short and that they were not too long. I liked that the exercises were easy to understand and that they were not too difficult. I liked that"
