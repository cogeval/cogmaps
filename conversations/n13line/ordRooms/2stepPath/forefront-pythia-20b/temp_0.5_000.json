You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10.

You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"
