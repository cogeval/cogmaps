From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment.

We want to count commas, then split the number into one number and one comma. So, in this case, I add a \", \" before the number, then split it into one number and one comma.\n\nTo convert the string to an array, we need to split it into numbers and commas. To do that, we can use the split method:\n\nsplit () returns an array of elements that are substrings of the original string, based on the provided separator string.
