You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

From the sample input, the keywords are:\n\n  * Imagine a world with twelve rooms\n  * Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?\n\nFor an AI assistant, it is good to check if the keywords exist. If not, then ask for clarification. The next step is to find the number of keywords in the question. For the sample question, we have two keywords. Now, we move on to the next step.\n\n#### Step 2: Break Down the Words in the Question\n\nTo get the right answer, you need to understand the question. Let's have a look at the question. To do that, we need to break down the question into parts. In this case, we break down the question into three parts, as shown in the following figure.\n\nFigure 8.1 Breaking down the question into parts\n\nNow that we know the parts, let's move on to the next step.\n\n#### Step 3: Find the"

From the answer, we can see that there are four numbers in the following format:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5\n\nNow we need to check if the answer follows the regular expression. The answer does follow the regular expression, and therefore, the regular expression for the answer is:\n\n/1(,2(,3(,5))/\n\nThe regular expression for the answer is /1(,2(,3(,5))/.\n\n#### Step 5: Write the Regular Expression\n\nWe know the regular expression for the answer.
