Rephrased the questions.\nA hummingbird went to a tree with ten flowers one after another, and visited exactly eight flowers. It does not visit the same flower more than once. Then it turned back towards the tree, but along a different route. He visited exactly five flowers, which were not the ones he visited before. When he was back at the original tree where he started, did he visit the flowers in the same order than first time starting from the lowest flower?\nNo he did not6Where should be entry to get the correct answer?\nIf the initial order was like this: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J are 10 flowers\nThe first round should look like this: A,B,C,E,F,G,J,(just iterates and visits every one),"
