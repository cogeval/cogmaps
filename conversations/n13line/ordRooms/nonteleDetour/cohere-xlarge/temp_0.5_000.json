You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

We know that each room is connected to each other, and we can only enter the lobby once, so we can't enter the room with the most money more than once. Therefore, we can start from any room, and then we can choose the room with the most money at each intersection. We can find the answer through the data, which is the number of rooms in each room, and the total number of rooms is 12.\n\nThere are 12 rooms, and we can't choose more than 1 room, so we only have 12 choices. This means that the probability of entering the room with the most money is 1/12, and the probability of entering the room with the second most money is 1/11. So we can only enter the lobby twice, and the probability of entering the room with the most money is 2/12, and the probability of entering the room with the second most money is 2/11.\n\nWe enter the lobby and choose a room to enter, and we have to choose one room. We enter room 1, then room"
