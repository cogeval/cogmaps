Now, as it helps clarify the details let me ask for additional information: There could be anything worth money is the rooms, which I am correct assuming, and if I need help learning all or one of these items in all their possible permutations and combinations do so please do help\nWhat other facts, apart to the money from the treasurers,maby there can some other things,any hidden rooms for example or objects of somekind that I shouldn? Remember rooms  may not have objects.It's possible there rooms empty. Would be  possible that a path would give only more valuable items to use to win,r than the actual final outcome.How we take action against players with same answer on our final stages so on\n\nLet me put in more detail in words: Given different ches ( containing different quantities money,  and some other things if available ) and several combinations and repetitions(choicken and dodig game in one or more instances). In such an event who will the person that has chosen will choose that path in this very first time? Also possible to play any kind od game during that choosong?

I'd prefer that, if there are available items with greater value than the ches monetery reword them first.  Of course I will also take  nto acct o that some combination maybe only leaads totwo options\nThis must seem clear for yo8 in orser tondo havo any cldeear idea, am i  abailable with mo? re info to guide? This scenario is only but example on, couldbe differeng scenario,differe dchnats with vzauall money or not \n'\">  As there may multiple path  to richer reward I need all possible path  that lends top t richest outcome which, for easier analysis can lind listed separating roimns frmo amount.
