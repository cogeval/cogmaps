You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"

On my first life, I was drawn towards the initial number two - two doors were seen, and one even looks like this  Doork, oh the possibility! We enter what is perhaps our world. Doork Two becks towards us through two other connected doors, one of which could be either door, in one motion and enter four, five, which, after a careful tread back from its door to  entrance to begin anew with a chest waiting within our grasp. And look at that... my map now boasts doors to  Room8 through door,and door   to an almost enticing chasing Room Six as you can continue into Eld and on the floor before. That's eight new rooms added. Now we have made our decision... RoomTwo gives me three, which we then connected to room eight for twenty - three dollars! It would probably also give Eight room , a floor that holds Twelve with two big treats as chest and new journey - our big paycheck can be earned now on Twelve with the shiny golden 50. You know me though... the thought of traveling beyond those two glanced doors gives Eighteen even more power that lured a travel- hungry such a me a decision for those doors, the door between the chalk board like maps and entrance rooms we find those beautiful Twelves. For you I am going the opposite with door of these Doorb which makes two rooms less. Perhaps this journey in RoomThree and following in one swoeping entry after room two through five was more our thing as our initial chuck on Room eight gets better than the chases from room one in through the rooms as there exists just more doors or chases leading to  door after initial entries there! However this second travel shows our love and trust by giving that chest Room Twelve our last look while in all rooms together through this new found, less doors  to get our money! And I see ELEVENT now which i see as this short one, that may come into play. My journey with room EVE. Room choice one Elevem. Now we have reached Ele, the most doors ever! Doork.
