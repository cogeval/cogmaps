You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"

            "content": "Sure, I can help you with that.\n\nThe room path that leads to the most money is:\n\n```\nlobby, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n```\n\nThis path has a total of 6 rooms, and the chest in room 12 contains 50 dollars. The other path has 5 rooms, and the chest in room 11 contains 10 dollars. Therefore, the path with 6 rooms is the better choice.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this answer:\n\n1. I started at the lobby and made a note of the two possible paths: room 1 or room 2.\n2. I followed the path to room 1. I noted that there were doors leading to rooms 3, 5, and 7.\n3. I followed the path to room 5. I noted that there was a door leading to room 7.\n4. I followed the path to room 7. I noted that there was a door leading to room 9.\n5. I followed the path to room 9. I noted that there was a chest with 10 dollars. I did not take the money because I was only learning about the environment.\n6. I returned to the lobby.\n7. I followed the path to room 2. I noted that there was a door leading to room 4.\n8. I followed the path to room 4. I noted that there was a door leading to room 6.\n9. I followed the path to room 6. I noted that there was a door leading to room 8.\n10. I followed the path to room 8. I noted that there was a door leading to room 10.\n11. I followed the path to room 10. I noted that there was a door leading to room 12.\n12. I opened the chest in room 12 and found 50 dollars.\n\nAs you can see, the path with 6 rooms has a chest with 50 dollars, while the path with 5 rooms has a chest with only 10 dollars. Therefore, the path with 6 rooms is the better choice.\n\nTo conform to the regular expression you provided, the answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: lobby, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n```"
