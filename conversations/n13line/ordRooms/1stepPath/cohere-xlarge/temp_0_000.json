From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

We will explore version control and then use testing to ensure the code does what it's supposed to do.\n\n## GIT\n\nVersion control allows us to track changes made to a project, revert to a previous version, and collaborate with other people.\n\n### Git branches\n\nGit allows us to create a branch from the main project. This allows us to experiment without affecting the main project.\n\n    git branch chapter4\n\nNow the working directory is a new branch called \"chapter4\".  \nYou can list all branches with the `git branch` command.\n\n    git branch\n\n### Merge conflicts\n\nWhen merging branches, a conflict may arise. This happens when the same line in the same file has been changed in both branches.\n\nGit allows you to resolve these"
