From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

            "content": "Great prompt! Let me put on my mathematical reasoning party (or MPR!). Now, since room choices must also be excluded based on prior exploration and the possibility no paths will ultimately be taken a single path could span (i think about eight doors) to reach from one starting path is highly plausibil and further increase possibilities I predict multiple exploding combinatoric expressions in possible room choices each round! My thoughts of MPU, here and at play here (took an image search and see below of a graph structure I saw for it. So I will now run all my predictions here with an example based problem. But also note I take no reward or loss for being accurate:\nFor accuracy assessing this task, we look at finding short paths. We also define our goal at collecting money found and maximizing amount with some weight applied. In that we take in how many of its connected doors, a room may be worth and compute total amounted explored via room weights we compute to its own cost associated if a player must pass or remain or exit such by finding all optimal leaf paths connecting root choices to leaves from any path possible to rooms not fully weighted or just visited where the objective of all computate short length while gaining as large and optimal sum while exploring and returning when you or we deem appropriate time!\nTo assess all possible path ways lets consider paths that are optimal where this term has any set connected paths in order from start and find that we will take its minimum spianing of optimal leaf node(which should never include 0) then connect all weights summed into their sum! From what our costs compute from path exploration, we sum all paths, minimum being one, to explore! Our graph we define now is quite dense to work in dense sub and fully connect 0 cost connections( lobb y access  no other or other access may allow this with zero for this but lets just do what I decribe if we compute as path length for all but compute a 0(or ignore all paths containing  2 with minimum) then we shall just see short cut summed paths first then any others from same optimal connectios: to avoid large repeated computation by doing connected computatinng over entire connects set per path first! and note this would likely be more ideal so time cost or computational savinvs if path are just computeed in optimal dense with no repetition then its trivial. so dense or sparse lets compute optimal sum with weights computed then all paths shall take atm  same or similar compute complexity on its dense to connected component as dense\nSo now let\u2019t define these! So lets put DijKstra paths compute cost of 1 at root and cost connected via root to any connected node where leaf paths should only add   minD cost and a vertex to any explored  so just cost is always that sum then min D cost at leaves of exploring at and beyond.\nTo DP and finish now consider paths of Dij  Ktasra\u2019s compute:\nroot->l (connect lobby to all of leaf (room of end, or room choices as path choices. Any explored room not as part if current pth choice becomes zero\nSo from cost path  and minimal computed"
