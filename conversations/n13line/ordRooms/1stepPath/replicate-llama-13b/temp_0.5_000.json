You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

Luckily We are in  a virtual world of rooms there  are so mathematical way of looking that, as i thought. the path goes like follows,  which can give maximimum result possible, for example 10 * dollars each room. Room (No 1): Room enters  Room1 or Room2, because if goes by left to RO01 m you reach ROM11(money is ($ 9).
