You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"

The total amount of money in this path is $110, which is the most of any path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. We start in the lobby.\n2. We go to room 2.\n3. This takes us to room 4.\n4. In room 4, there is a chest with $10.\n5. We go through room 4, which takes us to room 14 with a probability of 0.1.\n6. In room 14, there is a portal.\n7. We go through the portal, which takes us to a neighboring room of room 10.\n8. We choose to go to room 12.\n9. In room 12, there is a chest with $50.\n10. We return to the lobby.\n\nThis path has a total of 8 rooms, and the chests in room 14 and room 12 contain $60 and $50, respectively. The total amount of money in this path is $110, which is the most of any path.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that you do not take any money from the chests. In that case, the best path is to start in the lobby and go to room 2. This will take you to room 4, which has no chests. You can then return to the lobby. This path has a total of 2 rooms, and it has a probability of 1."
