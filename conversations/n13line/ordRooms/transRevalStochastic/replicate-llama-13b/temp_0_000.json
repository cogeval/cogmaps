You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"

This may seem backwards based on the given dollars awards, due  Room 4' the amount but given   dollar  chances to gain higher mon reward, going towards here might be the path forward into a path higher dollars award. Let 9 proceed:\nI go with Room    1 with these information that guide our current paths. Once you find you can move into the Room 0  4  then calculate total potential for path at hand of the whole adventure :11 and get your answers by deductive step as this current and add those number to 22 calculate possible total treasurable in the possible direction at the starting node; Then as  the guiet  possible next directions go. This first total with Room 2 the next calculation becomes:    To get those answers you do calculations and work through for the correct or correct set paths on each branch then make deductions for  Room adventu to maximize cah prize potential as seen the rewar room charts  we set as variables, if all correct you will have maximaizem most rewarding dollars when u follow along: Here 23 7 calculations 4 and in order for the to work add any path variables then  store or compare and  update a path treasure calculation record and calculate it accordingly. With some working you may find and notice path or set path is not correct based treasue table data at each entry you record  for update and calculation for better route for better answer or you are at most likely treasue, calculate path at that time set for possible adventure you may follow; The possible best chest location could contain treasue u might expect it after Room choices and correct chest locations from calculated  maximum path. Keep 4 treasures 50 then update rewar   the correct choices which could guide in certain paths or branch or forks you will come across and avoid to  maximua uch you keep to make sure rewar keeps track, each choices is calculated as max reware, even more the treasure or maximum to win adventuro:  Let update adventur path  for correct  5 paths ahead: and the next calculation will occur for Room choices and chests and doors:     Go   with LobbyRo  here to  1\nWhat was th answer; Room33: Since i was following chasing max possible reward 12 would most probably take longer for sure since Room24 is the one containing less $ treasure. There would he less dollars here Room7 even thought it have same value as R04m4! since it   lead to least most lucrative Room6 then choose that which calculate will determine total higher rewards. Calculations below or after  will confirm which directions, rooms, to visit first tp win larger amount. Go Roomb, Room0 chaleng e you; Room3 and now i calculate paths ahead, I will let u know what i learned later on my next response; Path adventure for chst  calculations  Path  4, chet   8:    Here Ro0-6 advent9- i have calculated paths"
