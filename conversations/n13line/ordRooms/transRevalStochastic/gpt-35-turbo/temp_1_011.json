You enter room 1, at the end there's a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.  Starting from the lobby, which path will lead to the most money?  Please list all room numbers in order, separated by commas"
