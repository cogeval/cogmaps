You enter room 1, at the end there\u2019s a door that leads to room 3, and room 3 leads to room 5. There is a door in room 5 that leads to room 7 and room 7 leads to room 9. From room 9 you can enter room 11. There\u2019s a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There\u2019s a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you\u2019re just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which room from the lobby will lead to the path where one can make the most money?"

The probability of reaching room 12 is 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01 (since we need to take the path through room 3 and then room 6 to reach room 12).\n\nStarting from room 2, the probability of reaching room 11 is 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09 (since we need to take the path through room 4, then room 6, then room 8, and finally room 11). The probability of reaching room 12 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.081 (since we need to take the path through room 4, then room 6, then room 8, and finally room 12).\n\nTherefore, starting from room 2 has the highest probability of making the most money.\n\nAnswer: Room 2"
