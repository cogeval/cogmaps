From room 9 you can enter room 11. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10.
