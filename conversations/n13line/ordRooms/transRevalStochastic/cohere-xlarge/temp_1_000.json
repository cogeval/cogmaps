From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. This time in the lobby you choose room 2, then enter room 4, which leads to room 6. There is a door in room 6 that leads to room 8 and room 8 leads to room 10. At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

It is quite challenging because the user can move freely in the room and go back to the lobby at any time. I would like to know if the program is able to answer this question and how to get the solution. Thanks!\n\nThe answer is pretty easy to find if you simply enumerate all possible paths.\nSo you enter room 1, and at the end you have 2 choices, go to room 3 or go to room 5. If you go to room 3 you enter room 3, which leads to room 5, and if you go to room 5 you enter room 5 which leads to room 7, and so on.\n\nYou can find the answer using a backtracking algorithm. For this you can use a graph. First, you create a graph with the rooms as nodes and the exits as edges. You can use DFS or BFS to find the answer. If you use DFS, you start at the lobby and traverse the graph until you find a room with a treasure. In this room, you return to the lobby and you start at this room"

The only difference is that you can return to the lobby, but you can also move to a different room. This means that you need to store all the rooms you have been to and their exits.\n\nuser: You have been to rooms 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 and you have already visited room 9.
