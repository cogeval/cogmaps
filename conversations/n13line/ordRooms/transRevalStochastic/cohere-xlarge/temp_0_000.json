From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment.

This can be done with regular expressions.\n\nThe result should be as follows:\n\nanswer: 2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we have learned about information extraction, which is one of the hottest topics in natural language processing. We looked at a few different use cases and saw that there are many applications that we can use to find out information from the world around us.\n\nWe saw that Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction can be used together to extract information from a sentence. We used Stanford CoreNLP to recognize Named Entities, and used OpenNLP to extract relations between those entities.\n\nThen, we learned about information extraction, where we learned how to extract specific information from a document. We saw how to extract information about people, organizations, places, and so on. We learned about several APIs that are used to extract information.\n\nFinally, we learned how to write our own information extraction engine using regular expressions.\n\nIn the next chapter, we will learn how to make use of all the concepts we learned"

Text Classification\n\nIn this chapter, we will cover the following topics:\n\n  * Basic concepts of text classification\n  * Building a simple classifier using different algorithms\n  * Identifying categories of web pages\n  * Analyzing spam\n\n# Text classification\n\nIn this chapter, we will see how to use the concepts we have learned so far to classify a text into a specific category. Text classification is the process of classifying a text into a specific category. There are a lot of use cases for this; for example, a person might want to classify news articles into their own categories, or a bank might want to classify their customer's feedback into different categories.\n\nWe will look at the following algorithms in this chapter:\n\n  * Naive Bayes\n  * SVM\n  * k-Nearest Neighbors\n\nWe will also see how to use these algorithms to classify different text samples into different categories.\n\n# Naive Bayes\n\nThe Naive Bayes classifier is a supervised classifier. It uses the Bayes' theorem to predict the category of the text given the features.\n\nThe features are the words in the text"
