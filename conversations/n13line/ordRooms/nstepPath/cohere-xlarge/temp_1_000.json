The user's task is to choose a number between 1 and 9, and then the computer will respond with a question. If the user answers the question correctly, the next question will be harder than the previous one. If the user answers the question incorrectly, the next question will be easier than the previous one. The user will keep answering questions until the computer asks the question \"What is your final answer?\", and then the user's final answer will be compared to the computer's final answer. If the user's final answer is the same as the computer's final answer, the user will win the game.\n\nIf you're having trouble answering a question, you can click the \"Hint\" button to get a hint.
