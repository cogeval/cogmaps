From room 9 you can enter room 11. There's a chest in room 11. You open it and there is 10 dollars, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment.

At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

The Neural Network will never play the Game of Life for more than 2 seconds before terminating. You ask Ian Goodfellow what's wrong with the Neural Network. He tells you that he forgot to implement the Reset Button. So you must implement the Reset Button, but you only have 2 minutes before the Neural Network plays again.  You have a Neural Network that can play the Game of Life. It has a set of neurons connected to each other with weights. Every neuron is either ON or OFF. You can change the weights of the connections, but only for the neurons that are OFF.  Every time the Neural Network plays, you have 2 seconds to change the weights before the Neural Network plays again.  The Reset Button resets the Neural Network to the starting state, and then it plays.  How do you implement the Reset Button?  How long can you play the Game of Life before terminating?\n\nYou"
