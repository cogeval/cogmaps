The graduate student innovator is expected to perform research in conjunction with one or more academic researchers associated with AFRL's 711th Human Performance Wing on topics of interest. Business concepts and ideas regarding application transition are welcomed.\nProject descriptions are below. Matches between student and host are expected, but not guaranteed. Students are encouraged to contact the host research providers for additional details prior to applying.\n* Obstacle Density Mapping and Perception\nIn response to the growth of the selfie-pose 3D point-cloud map world, data from indoor mapping technologies need to be enhanced to confidently address day- and night-time scenarios. Making point density comparisons on day- and night-time images, a known rich source of information in important for future indoor optical mapping technologies. During daylight, human perceptual mechanisms can cover for sparse features, and during the nighttime it requires special attention for detectable and non-distressing maps. Perception could be conditioned"
