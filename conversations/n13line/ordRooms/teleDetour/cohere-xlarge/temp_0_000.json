At the end there is a door that leads to room 12. There's a chest with 50 dollars in room 12, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to the lobby.

The parser will know that you're trying to end the expression.\n\nThe first thing the program does is validate the input. You can't enter an empty string or a number. If the input is invalid, it will return an empty list. Otherwise, it will return the list of answers.\n\nThe next thing the program does is take all the words from the input, remove the punctuation and convert them to lowercase. The output of this step is a list of all the words.\n\nNext the program parses each word and creates a list of \"paths\" of length two. For example, for the word \"room\", the output would be:\n\nNote that if a word doesn't match a regular expression, it will be included in the \"paths\" list with the regular expression of \"empty\"\n\nNow the program will filter out all the paths that don't have a value of 10 or 50 at the end. If there are no paths left, the program will return an empty list.\n\nThis program was written to help students practice"
