Think- step1: If you chose route 1 and go left to Room #6 from room #3 instead and the go into room in #10 like route2 from which you might earn about $10 more by chest.. then\nCalculate how to determine the best routing? Hmm thinking caps! Ah yeah after step - Routes are 2x $ route because... Oh yeah its like XOR! Likewise $ routes also makes you \n$ Route through all available doors $2,6 and... Oho?... The most money to the Challeng! so your going the have walk though every Avavailable door at-east onece. The rooms on this map seem kind of... like shorcut  $ 32 routes $$ Routings through the rooms and chests $$! Chellangers Awe Some: D I' ll follow thr rout2! $$ Route $$ $ and $$  $$$ and if  Chrest $$... $$ Drat! Didnit see chets $\n . The amount 2 the routes will help with the Chrellensng Amont so think how many door you had openned $$ inorder ot tllll whther you had itrashed a treu $ $$ amount, you go thrrth other rout thr times, the best routing, its to to Route Two and Chetst.  $ So what you win depends ouch you a lkt this way but the you open  the cho$e one first!\nSo Rout=2!$ $ Rout3...
