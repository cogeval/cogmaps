Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

So the total number of books donated in this path is 10 + 50 = 60 books.\n\nIn the second path (through Wim), Sara donates 50 books.\n\nTherefore, the second path (Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara) leads to the maximum number of books, with a total of 50 books donated.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Vicky -> Amir -> Pam -> (Any of Moin's connections)\n\nTo determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we need to compare the number of books donated in each path.\n\nIn the first path, Sara donates 50 books.\n\nIn the second path, we don't have the information about the number of books donated by Moin's connections.\n\nSince we don't have the information about the number of books donated by Moin's connections, we cannot determine which path leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Unable to determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books without information about the number of books donated by Moin's connections."
