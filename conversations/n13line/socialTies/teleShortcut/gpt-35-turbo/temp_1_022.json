Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Sara has 50 books to donate, but we don't take any books.\n\nHowever, now we have a new connection with Pam. Pam has an instant connection portal to Moin's connections. Let's explore this path:\n\n16. From Moin, we can connect with Pam through the instant connection portal.\n17. Through the portal, we can connect with any of Moin's connections.\n18. Since our goal is to maximize the number of books, we need to find the connection with the highest number of books.\n19. We know that Sara has 50 books to donate, which is the highest number.\n20. So, we connect with Sara through Pam and collect the 50 books.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books, considering the connection with Pam, is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Pam (connecting to Sara).\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Pam."
