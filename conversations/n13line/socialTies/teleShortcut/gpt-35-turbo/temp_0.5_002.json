Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The first path has a total of 10 books, while the second path has a total of 50 books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is:\n\nVicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Unfortunately, the specific connections between Pam and Moin's connections are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact path with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, without information about Pam's connections to Moin's connections, we cannot determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky.\n\nAnswer: Unable to determine without information about Pam's connections to Moin's connections."
