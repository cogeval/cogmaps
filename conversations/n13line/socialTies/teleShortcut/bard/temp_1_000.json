Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

However, you are not interested in taking any investment at this time. You are only interested in learning about the environment. Therefore, it does not matter which friend you talk to. You will not be taking any investment from any of them.\r\n\r\nEven if you were interested in taking investment, it would not matter which friend you talk to. The probability of you getting an investment from either friend is the same.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you have mentioned that you are just starting out and are not yet ready to take any investment. Therefore, it is more important for you to learn about the different producers and their investment options before making a decision. Talking to both Nora and Philip will give you a better understanding of the options available to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have mentioned that you are interested in learning about the environment. Talking to both Nora and Philip will give you a better understanding of their environmental policies. This information will be important to you when you are making a decision about which producer to work with.\r\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, it does not matter which friend you talk to. You will not be taking any investment from either of them, and you are more interested in learning about the different producers and their environmental policies."
