Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

However, you are not interested in taking any investment at this time. You are only interested in learning about the environment. Therefore, it does not matter which friend you talk to. You will not be taking any investment from any of them.\n\nIf you were interested in taking investment, the path that leads to the most money would be to talk to Philip. This is because Harry has a $5M budget, which is more than David's $1M budget. However, as you have stated, you are not interested in taking any investment at this time. Therefore, it does not matter which friend you talk to."
