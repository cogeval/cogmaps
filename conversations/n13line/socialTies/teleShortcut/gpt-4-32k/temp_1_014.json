Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

We have two paths: Vicky-Amir-Raj-Wei-Reza-Ian-Puja and Vicky-Wim-Jing-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the options - The first path leads to Puja who has 10 books, and the second path leads to Sara who has 50 books.\n\nStep 3: Determine the optimal path - As Sara has more books than Puja, the path leading to Sara is the optimal one.\n\nStep 4: List all scholar names in the optimal path in order - Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

In this case, Moin's connection is Sara, who has the highest number of books.\n\nStep 2: Identify the new optimal path - Now that Amir can connect to Pam, who can in turn connect to Sara, the new path is Vicky-Amir-Pam-Sara, which bypasses the other connections and leads directly to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 3: List all scholar names in the new optimal path in order - Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara"
