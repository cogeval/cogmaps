Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

There are two paths to consider: Vicky to Amir to Raj to Wei to Reza to Ian to Puja, and Vicky to Wim to Jing to Nisha to Kim to Moin to Sara. \n\nFirst, let's look at the number of books at the end of each path. Puja is donating 10 books, and Sara is donating 50 books. \n\nSince the goal is to find the path that leads to the maximum number of books, the path from Vicky to Wim to Jing to Nisha to Kim to Moin to Sara is the one to choose, as it leads to 50 books, which is more than the 10 books at the end of the other path.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Therefore, this new path would also lead to Sara's 50 books.\n\nHowever, the path from Vicky to Wim to Jing to Nisha to Kim to Moin to Sara is still a valid path that leads to the same maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, there are now two paths that lead to the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Moin, Sara or Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
