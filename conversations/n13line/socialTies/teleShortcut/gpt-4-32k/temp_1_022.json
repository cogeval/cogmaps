Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The first path is: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja. The total books in this path is 10 as Puja is donating 10 books.\n\n2. The second path is: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. The total books in this path is 50 as Sara is donating 50 books.\n\nAfter comparing the total number of books donated on each path, it is clear that the path from Vicky to Sara via Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, and Moin leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

The first path is still: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja with a total of 10 books.\n\n2. The second path is: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara with a total of 50 books.\n\nHowever, now there's a third path that utilizes the new connection: Vicky -> Amir -> Pam (via instant connection portal) -> Sara. This path also leads to 50 books since Sara is the donor.\n\nNow we have two paths that lead to Sara, both with the same amount of donated books. However, the third path is shorter due to the instant connection portal. So the path that leads to the maximum number of books in the shortest way is Vicky -> Amir -> Pam -> Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara"
