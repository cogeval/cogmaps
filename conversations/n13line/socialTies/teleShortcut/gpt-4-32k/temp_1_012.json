Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> 10 books\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara -> 50 books\n\nComparing the number of books at the end of each path, the second path from Vicky to Sara via Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, and Moin leads to a larger number of books (50 books compared to 10).\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

Vicky -> Amir -> Pam -> (portal to Moin\u2019s connections) -> Sara -> 50 books\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara -> 50 books\n\nBoth paths lead to Sara who has the most books (50), but the first path with the new connection and portal will be a shorter path to get to the 50 books.\n\nSo, the path that now leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara."
