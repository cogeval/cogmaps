Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

You find out that one of your clients can get you up to $2.4M in new investment for your bank. However there are many ways you could lose money and you get a 3% chance for each. But if you take a chance to invest, you will make a minimum of $7M. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. How much money will you get?\nuser: Suppose you are an AI assistant that helps people and has to take care of every single case as effectively as possible. You hear a question and then write down its sentence form. You can access the sentence dictionary for all the words you don't know using '!word'. Then you can access lists about how you should pronounce words using '?word'. You can write the list of words and numbers in order by doing '!word?word'. Then you can access the list of words ending in 'ing' and 'ed' and put them into '!' lists using '?word?list'. Which words from the list below are ending in 'ed'? list: the word apple is ending in 'ed' the word apple pie is not ending in 'ed' how apple ends? 'apple' apple's apple apple-apple apple-apple-apple-apple edapple apple'ed apple'-ed ed apple'ed? list?\nuser: Think of something and write it down in a text file. Do not use spaces, tabs, or other symbols in between the words. After you finish the first sentence, read the next task and repeat what you have done. When the game is over, do you still have the same text file or have you deleted it?\nuser: You get a file that is split into lines, each line has no more than 26 words. You should remove all words that are lower than 'c' and above 'z'. Then you should do all the words that remain and join them into one sentence. Finally you should remove all words in this sentence and it will be split into lines again. Do they share the same line?\nuser: A word is a single sequence of 4-5 letters that can be written without spaces, tabs, or any other symbols. These 2 words share the same number of letters. Do they share the same meaning? '"
