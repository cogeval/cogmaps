Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Which doesn't lead anybook to max. This Path lead one connection to another connection in max path. Ignoring first option\nWith wim you have one option, and he get Nish from him the Nish lead one connection Kim connected. With the Nish connected with:\nWith Nish I have Moin connected and Kim Connected; therefore, we go with this option. Path selection; with Nish <= Kim <= Moin => (Nish >=Moin) which max no connections as no more step ahead. Path Max selection ends here. Nish connected -> Kim connection no path can exceed as it has one-step lead and no next-step further paths can form which lead me on Moins as max selection. Finally, I choose path with starting condition Vicky connecting Amir. This path selection results in choosing option to have Nishi-Moin Connection without extending Path furthermore to its endpoint as it's maximization ends. Thus our Max result is reached via exploring one Connection from connecting (Wim) then with connection to connecting path. Which is (Vicky) Amir connected ending at (Vicky =>Amir path selection ending). This max option of ( (Wim)->>Max option at Wlm)) => ((wm -> connecting Amir) option => (Moinf))), the result path max selection we can find to connect wam (((Vick-WimPath selection, ending)) resulting) into books will result from NishiMo in books connected without another Path ahead after a complete loop\n\nPath with end: Max Nish Moin Selection end. Therefore Max answer is ((Wimm)). "
