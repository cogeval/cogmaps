Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"
