Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

If we choose Wim, the path would be Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. Sara has 50 books.\n\nSince we are looking for the path with the maximum number of books, the second path with Sara having 50 books is the optimal choice.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of books, starting from Vicky, is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

If we choose Amir, the regular path leads to Ian, and then Puja (with 10 books).\n2. If we choose Wim, we can use the instant connection portal to connect with any of Moin's connections.\n\nLet's explore the connections from Moin:\n- Moin is connected to Sara (with 50 books).\n- Moin is connected to Kim, who is connected to Nisha and Jing.\n\nFrom Sara, we cannot take any more books, so we can't consider that path.\n\nFrom Kim, we have two choices: Nisha and Jing.\n1. If we choose Nisha, the regular path leads to Kim, and then Moin and Sara (with 50 books).\n2. If we choose Jing, the regular path leads to Nisha, Kim, and then Moin and Sara (with 50 books).\n\nBoth choices from Kim lead to the same outcome, with Sara having 50 books.\n\nSince our goal is to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we choose the path with Sara having 50 books.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of books, starting from Vicky, is: Vicky, Wim, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Kim, Moin, Sara."
