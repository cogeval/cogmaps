Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

If we choose Amir, the path would be: Vicky -> Amir.\n3. Amir is connected to Raj. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj.\n4. Raj is connected to Wei. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei.\n5. Wei is connected to Reza. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza.\n6. Reza is connected to Ian. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian.\n7. Ian is connected to Puja, who donates 10 books. But since you're not taking any books, this path doesn't contribute to the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's try the other choice:\n\n1. Vicky has two choices: Amir and Wim.\n2. If we choose Wim, the path would be: Vicky -> Wim.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing.\n4. Jing is connected to Nisha. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha.\n5. Nisha is connected to Kim. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim.\n6. Kim is connected to Moin. So, the path becomes: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin.\n7. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate. Since you're not taking any books, this path doesn't contribute to the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the path starting from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian"
