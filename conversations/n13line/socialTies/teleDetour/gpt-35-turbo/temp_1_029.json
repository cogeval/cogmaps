Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

However, since this is the only available path, we can assume that it might lead to the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the path that will potentially lead to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara"
