Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Amir is connected to Raj.\n3. Raj is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Ian.\n6. Ian is connected to Puja, who donates 10 books.\n7. We don't take any books from Puja, so the total number of books remains 10.\n\nNow, let's explore the other branch:\n\n1. Starting from Vicky, we choose Wim.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is connected to Nisha.\n4. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n5. Kim is connected to Moin.\n6. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate.\n7. Again, we don't take any books from Sara, so the total number of books remains 50.\n\nComparing the two branches, we see that the path from Vicky to Wim to Jing to Nisha to Kim to Moin to Sara has the maximum number of books, which is 50.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order, separated by commas, are: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

Jing is connected to Nisha.\n5. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n6. Kim is connected to Moin.\n7. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order, separated by commas, are: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
