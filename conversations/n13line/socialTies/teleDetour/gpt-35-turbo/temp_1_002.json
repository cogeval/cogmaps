Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Wei is connected to Reza, and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja, who donates 10 books.\n\nWe then ask Vicky to connect us to Wim. Wim is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara, who donates 50 books.\n\nSince Sara donates more books (50) than Puja (10), the path starting from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nThe scholars in order, separated by commas, are: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

To determine which path will lead to the maximum number of books, we need to consider the connections of each scholar.\n\nAmir is connected to Raj, who is connected to Wei. Wei is connected to Reza, and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is now connected to Pam, who has an instant connection portal to any of Moin's connections.\n\nWim is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Moin. We don't know the direct connections of Moin.\n\nSince we want to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we need to consider the scholars connected to Moin. Without knowing the direct connections of Moin, we cannot determine the maximum number of books through this path.\n\nTherefore, the only viable option is to choose the path starting from Vicky, which goes through Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and then uses Pam's instant connection portal to connect with Moin's connections.\n\nThe scholars in order, separated by commas, are: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam (instant connection portal), and Moin's connections.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin's connections"
