Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Since the number of books donated by Moin is unknown, we cannot determine if this path leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, without more information about the number of books donated by Moin or any other possible connections, we cannot determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky.\n\nAnswer: Unable to determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky without more information."
