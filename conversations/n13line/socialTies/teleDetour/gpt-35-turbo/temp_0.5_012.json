Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Ian has a connection with Pam, who has an instant connection portal.\n2. From Pam's portal, we can connect with any of Moin's connections.\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of books, we need to find the connection with the scholar who has the maximum number of books. However, the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked.\n\nTherefore, we need to explore the connections from Pam's portal to find the scholar with the maximum number of books. Unfortunately, the information about the number of books each scholar has is missing, so it is not possible to determine the exact path that leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: It is not possible to determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books without information about the number of books each scholar has."
