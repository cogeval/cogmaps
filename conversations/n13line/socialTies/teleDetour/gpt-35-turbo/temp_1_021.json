Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

From Vicky, we have two choices: Amir and Wim.\n2. From Amir, we know he is connected to Raj.\n3. From Raj, we know he is connected to Wei.\n4. From Wei, we know he is connected to Reza.\n5.

From Kim, we know he is connected to Moin.\n7. From Moin, we know he is connected to Sara.\n8. Sara has 50 books to donate, but we are not taking any books, so we have reached the end.\n\nSince the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked, we need to explore the new connection with Pam.\n\n1. From Ian, we know he is connected to Pam through an instant connection portal.\n2. From Pam, we can connect to any of Moin's connections.\n3. From Moin, we know he is connected to Sara.\n4. Sara has 50 books to donate, but we are not taking any books, so we have reached the end.\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that both paths lead to the same scholar with the maximum number of books (Sara with 50 books). Therefore, the new path starting from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
