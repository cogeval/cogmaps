Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Since Moin was directly connected to Sara in the previous paths, we will use this connection. \n\nWe know from previous information that the path to Ian is Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian. Now we extend this path to reach Sara through the portal.\n\nThe new path becomes: \n\nVicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Pam - Moin - Sara\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara"
