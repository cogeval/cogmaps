Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

This requires analyzing the two potential paths from Vicky and determining which one leads to the scholar with the most books. \n\nStep 1: Analyze the first path from Vicky. This path goes from Vicky to Amir, then to Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and finally to Puja. Puja has 10 books to donate.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second path from Vicky. This path goes from Vicky to Wim, then to Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and finally to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books at the end of each path. Puja has 10 books, while Sara has 50 books.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books. The path that leads to Sara has the most books.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

This path goes from Vicky to Amir, then to Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and finally to Puja. Puja has 10 books to donate.\n\nStep 2: Consider the new connection from Ian to Pam. From Pam, it's possible to connect to any of Moin's connections. Moin's only connection is Sara, who has 50 books to donate.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the new path from Vicky to Sara using the instant connection portal. This path goes from Vicky to Amir, then to Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, then to Pam, and from Pam through the portal to Sara.\n\nTherefore, the new path that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Sara"
