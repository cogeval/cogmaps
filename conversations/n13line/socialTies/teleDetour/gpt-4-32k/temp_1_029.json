Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

However, we have a new connection, Pam, who has an instant connection portal to any of Moin's connections, and Moin is connected to Sara. \n\nIn this new situation, from Vicky, we can choose to go to Amir first and then continue on the path to Ian. Once at Ian, we can connect to Pam and use her instant connection portal to connect to Moin. Finally, we can use Moin's connection to reach Sara. \n\nThis way, we can reach Sara who has the most number of books to donate.\n\nThe scholars in order on this path are: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara."
