Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Along this path, Puja has 10 books to donate.\n\nThe second path starts with Vicky and connects to Wim, then Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin and finally Sara. Along this path, Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nNext, I will compare the two paths to determine which path leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nSara, with 50 books, has more than Puja, who only has 10 books.\n\nThus, the path leading to the maximum number of books is the path that leads to Sara. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

When you return to Vicky and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books, you discover that the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

From Ian, we can connect to Pam. Pam has an instant connection portal to any of Moin's connections. In this case, the most relevant connection would be directly to Sara who has 50 books to donate. \n\nWe're still focused on the path leading to the maximum number of books which means the path ending at Sara.\n\nSo now, with the new connections and the instant connection portal, the new path will be: \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Sara."
