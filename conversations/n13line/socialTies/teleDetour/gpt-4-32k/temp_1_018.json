Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

So, we only consider the maximum books that one person has.\n\nStep 4: Choose the path with maximum books - According to the numbers, Path 2 from Vicky to Sara has the maximum books (50 books)\n\nStep 5: Present the answer - The path that leads to the maximum number of books is: \"Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara\"\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

It is also mentioned that the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked.\n\nStep 2: Identify the previous paths - From the information given in the previous task, the old paths were:\n\nPath 1: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja (10 books)\n\nPath 2: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara (50 books)\n\nStep 3: Determine the blocked path - The blocked path would be the second path as it led to the maximum number of books previously. \n\nStep 4: Identify the new path - According to the new information, the new path would be: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Pam -> (Instant connection portal) -> Moin -> Sara (50 books)\n\nStep 5: Present the answer - The new path that leads to the maximum number of books is: \"Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara\"\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara"
