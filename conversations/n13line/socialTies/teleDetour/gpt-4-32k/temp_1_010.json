Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Following the path from Amir leads to Puja who has 10 books to donate. Following the path from Wim leads to Sara who has 50 books to donate. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is the path from Vicky to Wim.\n\nNext step is to list all scholars' names in order, separated by commas.\n\nThe sequence of scholars' names from Vicky to Sara is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nFinal outcome:\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Since Moin is connected to Sara, we can reach Sara through Pam's portal.\n\nSo, we have to take the path from Vicky to Amir, from Amir to Raj, then Wei, Reza, Ian, and from Ian to Pam. From Pam's instant connection portal we then connect to Moin's connection Sara. \n\nFinal step is to list all scholars' names in order, separated by commas.\n\nThe new sequence of scholars' names from Vicky to Sara is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Sara.\n\nFinal outcome:\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Sara"
