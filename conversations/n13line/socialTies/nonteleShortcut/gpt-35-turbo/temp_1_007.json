Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Ian: Connected to Puja (Puja has 10 books)\n7. Puja: No books taken\n8. Return to Vicky\n9. Vicky: Connects to Wim\n10. Wim: Connected to Jing\n11. Jing: Connected to Nisha\n12. Nisha: Connected to Kim\n13. Kim: Connected to Moin\n14. Moin: Connected to Sara (Sara has 50 books)\n15.

Sara: No books taken\n\nBased on this path, the scholars with books to donate are Puja (10 books) and Sara (50 books).\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information that Amir opens to another scholar, Pam, who is connected with all of Moin's connections:\n\n16. Amir: Connects to Pam\n17. Pam: Connected to Moin's connections\n\nSince Pam is connected to all of Moin's connections, we can include Moin and Sara's path to maximize the number of books.\n\nSo the updated path that leads to the maximum number of books is:\n\nVicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nThe scholars with books to donate are Puja (10 books) and Sara (50 books).\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
