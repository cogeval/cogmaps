Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Amir opens to Pam, who is connected to all of Moin's connections.\n\nNow, we have two options:\n\nOption 1: Continue with the previous path: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\nOption 2: Take the new path: Vicky, Amir, Pam.\n\nSince we are looking for the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we should choose the path with the highest number of books.\n\nOption 1 has a total of 10 books.\nOption 2 has a total of 0 books (since Pam is not connected to any book donor).\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books remains the same as before:\n\nVicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
