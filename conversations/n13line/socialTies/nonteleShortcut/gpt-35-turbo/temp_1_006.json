Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

If we choose Amir, we can follow the connections: Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja. Puja has 10 books to donate.\n2. If we choose Wim, we can follow the connections: Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nBased on the given connections, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara.\n\nSo the scholar names in order, separated by commas, are: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

Vicky -> Amir -> Pam: Since Pam is connected to all of Moin's connections, we will consider the path Vicky -> Amir -> Pam. We will need to go through the connections again from Pam onwards to determine the number of books to donate.\n\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara: This path remains the same as mentioned before.\n\nLet's evaluate the number of books to donate for each path:\n\n1. Vicky -> Amir -> Pam: We need to consider Pam's connections, which are the same as Moin's connections. Following the path from Pam, we have Pam -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara: Sara has 50 books to donate, as mentioned before.\n\nBased on this evaluation, both paths lead to the same maximum number of books (50 books). Therefore, we can choose either path.\n\nScholar names in order, separated by commas: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
