Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

You start at Vicky.\n2. You ask Vicky to connect you to Wim.\n3. You follow the path to Jing, Nisha, Kim, and Moin.\n4. You reach Moin, who is connected to Sara.\n5. You collect the 50 books from Sara.\n\nThis path gives you a total of **50** books, which is the maximum number of books that you can collect. Therefore, the path is the one that leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nHowever, you are told that Amir now opens to another scholar, Pam, who is connected with all of Moin's connections. This means that you can now take the path:\n\n```\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Moin, Kim, Sara (50 books)\n```\n\nThis path also gives you a total of **50** books, so it is also a valid path.\n\nThe final decision of which path to take is up to you. If you want to take the path that is less likely to be blocked, then you should take the path through Wim. However, if you want to take the path that is more likely to give you the maximum number of books, then you should take the path through Pam.\n\nDo you have any other questions?"
