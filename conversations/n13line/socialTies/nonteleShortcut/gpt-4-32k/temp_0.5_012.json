Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

This path includes the following scholars: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja. At the end of this path, Puja is donating 10 books.\n\nSecond, I will analyze the path starting from Vicky to Wim. This path includes the following scholars: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. At the end of this path, Sara is donating 50 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, the path from Vicky to Wim leads to a larger number of books (50 books compared to 10 books).\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

At the end of this path, Sara is donating 50 books, same as the path from Vicky to Wim.\n\nTherefore, both paths from Vicky to Amir (via Pam) and from Vicky to Wim lead to the same number of books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Kim, Moin, Sara or Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
