Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

One path is Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja and Puja has 10 books. The other path is Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara and Sara has 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Compare the number of books in both paths. Puja has 10 books and Sara has 50 books.\n\nStep 3: Determine which path has the maximum number of books. The path Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara has the maximum number of books because Sara has 50 books which is more than Puja's 10 books.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Amir is now connected to Pam. Pam has the same connections as Moin, which means Pam is connected to Sara who has 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Consider the new path from Vicky. The new path is Vicky - Amir - Pam - Sara. \n\nStep 3: Determine which path has the maximum number of books. The path Vicky - Amir - Pam - Sara also leads to Sara who has 50 books, the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 4: Compare the length of the paths. The new path from Vicky to Sara is shorter than the previous path from Vicky to Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Sara"
