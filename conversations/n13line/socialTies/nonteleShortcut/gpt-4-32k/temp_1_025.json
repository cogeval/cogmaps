Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

The first path goes through Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian and ends at Puja who has 10 books. The second path goes through Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin and ends at Sara who has 50 books. \n\nTo find the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we compare the number of books at the end of each path. Puja has 10 books and Sara has 50 books. \n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is the one that ends with Sara who has 50 books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

This path goes through Amir and then goes to Pam, who shares all of Moin's connections. \n\nMoin's connections were previously defined in the second path (Vicky to Sara) as Jing, Nisha, Kim, and Sara, who has 50 books.\n\nSo, the third path goes from Vicky to Amir, Pam, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and ends at Sara who has 50 books. \n\nThis path leads to the same maximum number of books as the second path. So, the two paths that lead to the maximum number of books are:\n\nVicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara and Vicky, Amir, Pam, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
