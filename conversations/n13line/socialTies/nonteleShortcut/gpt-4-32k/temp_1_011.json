Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

This path results in a donation of 10 books from Puja.\n3. The second path from Vicky is to Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara. This path results in a donation of 50 books from Sara.\n4. Comparing the two paths, the path that leads to Sara results in a larger donation of books.\n\nSo, the path from Vicky leading to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

The original first path from Vicky was to Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and Puja, which ended with 10 books from Puja.\n3. With the new connection, the path can now go from Vicky, Amir, Pam, and then follow all of Moin's connections (Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara). Sara donates 50 books.\n4. The second path from Vicky is to Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara. This path results in a donation of 50 books from Sara.\n5. Comparing the two paths, both now result in a donation of 50 books. However, the question asks for the path that leads to the maximum number of books. As both paths have the same maximum number, either can be chosen.\n\nSo, either path from Vicky leading to the maximum number of books can be selected. However, as the question was about the new connection through Amir and Pam, I'll choose that path.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Pam, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
