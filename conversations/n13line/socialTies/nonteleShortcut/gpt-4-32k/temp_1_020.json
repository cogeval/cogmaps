Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

This path is Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja. Puja has 10 books to donate.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second path from Vicky. This path is Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books available at the end of each path. The first path leads to 10 books, and the second path leads to 50 books.\n\nStep 4: Determine that the path leading to the maximum number of books is the second path, starting from Vicky and ending at Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Sara still has 50 books to donate.\n\nStep 2: Compare the number of books available at the end of each path. The first path (now leading to Sara) has 50 books and the second path (also leading to Sara) has 50 books.\n\nStep 3: Both paths lead to the same number of books.
