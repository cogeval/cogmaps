Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

The first guy has a wife who is friends with the fourth guy who has a cousin who is friends with a fifth guy. But the fourth guy refuses to provide an introduction, and therefore you will not meet any of these fifth guy. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.\nAnswer: I think the wife should introduce me to the fifth guy, because she\u2019s married to the first guy, who knows a 4th guy, who has a 5th guy who can give $9M. So if you can do a 5th round, it\u2019s a $27M budget.\nYou are sitting at the table with four people. The first guy has a wife, she has a friend and she wants to introduce you to that friend. But the first guy has a friend, he also has a friend, and the first guy needs information from that second friend. But you will not meet any others, and then return to the first guy; then return to the first guy and then return to the first guy. What do you do?\nAnswer: ask the wife to introduce you to her friend\nIf we're at the final round of questioning and my assistant tells me that they've run out of time. I will have them ask each individual to introduce to someone who can answer me and give the most money. Then the assistant will come back for a final answer. Why am I going to the last person? Because if it has happened to be Nora's husband Peter in the previous round. If that happens again, my assistant won't ask Philip to introduce me to the fifth person, it's Nora's husband who can give more money.\nYou are a financial assistant going on a date with your boyfriend. She asked you a favour, she needs to borrow some money because she can't"
