Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The path leading to the maximum number of books: \n\nVicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara\n\n2. The path leading to the minimum number of books: \n\nVicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara\n\nFor path 1, the total number of books donated would be 10 + 50 = 60. For path 2, the total number of books donated would be 0 + 50 = 50. Thus, path 1 leads to the maximum number of books. The scholars in order for path 1 are: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara."

The scholar from Vicky that leads to the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is Wim. \n\nThe probability of getting the maximum number of books from Wim is 1/2, or 50%, as Wim has a connection to both Jing and Wei. The probability of getting the minimum number of books from Wim is also 1/2, or 50%, as Wim has a connection to both Jing and Nisha.\n\nTo determine the probability of getting the maximum number of books, the probabilities of each connection in the path must be multiplied together. The probability of getting the maximum number of books from Wim is:\n0.9 x 0.9 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81, or 81%\n\nThe probability of getting the minimum number of books from Wim is:\n0.1 x 0.9 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 0.1 x 0.9 = 0.9, or 90%\n\nTherefore, the path leading to the maximum number of books is the most likely path to achieve the maximum number of books, with a probability of 81%. The path leading to the minimum number of books is the second most likely path to achieve the maximum number of books, with a probability of 90%."
