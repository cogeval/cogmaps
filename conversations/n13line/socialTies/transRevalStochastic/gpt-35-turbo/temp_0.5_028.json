Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is:\nVicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books.

Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja (10 books)\n2. Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara (50 books)\n\nConsidering the probabilities, we need to calculate the probability of each path. Let's calculate the probabilities for each path:\n\nPath 1: Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja\nThe probability of this path is:\nP(Vicky) * P(Amir) * P(Raj | Amir) * P(Wei | Raj) * P(Reza | Wei) * P(Ian | Reza) * P(Puja | Ian)\n\nPath 2: Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara\nThe probability of this path is:\nP(Vicky) * P(Wim) * P(Jing | Wim) * P(Nisha | Jing) * P(Kim | Nisha) * P(Moin | Kim) * P(Sara | Moin)\n\nGiven the probabilities mentioned, we can calculate the probabilities for each path and choose the one with the highest probability.\n\nAnswer: To determine the scholar from Vicky that leads to the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books, we need to know the probabilities of each connection. Please provide the probabilities for each connection."
