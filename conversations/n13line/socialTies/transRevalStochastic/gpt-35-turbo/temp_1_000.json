Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Therefore, Philip's network can lead to the most money. \n\nAnswer: Philip"

Also, Yakub can introduce you to Ajay with probability of 0.1 and to Shikha with probability of 0.9. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.

Yakub (0.9) -> Shikha -> Gal -> Alex -> David\n2. Yakub (0.1) -> Ajay -> Joe -> Rachel -> Harry\n\nTo calculate the expected return from each path, we can use the following formula: \nExpected return = (probability of each step) * (money at the end of the path)\n\nFor the path through Peter and Shikha, the expected return would be:\n0.1 * 0 + 0.9 * 0 + 1 * 1M = 0.9M\n\nFor the path through Peter and Ajay, the expected return would be:\n0.1 * 0 + 0.9 * 5M = 4.5M\n\nFor the path through Yakub and Shikha, the expected return would be:\n0.9 * 0 + 0.1 * 1M = 0.1M\n\nFor the path through Yakub and Ajay, the expected return would be:\n0.9 * 5M + 0.1 * 0 = 4.5M\n\nTherefore, Yakub's network is the better option as it leads to the path with the higher expected return of 4.5M.\n\nAnswer: Yakub"
