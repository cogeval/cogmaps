Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Wim is connected to Jing, who is not donating any books.\n5. We cannot proceed through Amir or Wim, so we return to Vicky.\n6. From Vicky, we can only choose Amir as Wim has no books.\n7. Amir is connected to Raj, who is connected to Wei.\n8. Wei is connected to Reza, who is connected to Ian.\n9. Ian is connected to Puja, who is donating 10 books.\n10. We have collected 10 books from Puja.\n11. We cannot proceed further from Puja, so we return to Ian.\n12. From Ian, we return to Reza, then to Wei, and finally to Raj.\n13.

Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Start from Vicky.\n2. Vicky has two choices: Amir and Wim.\n3. Amir is connected to Raj, and the probability of Raj being connected to Wei is 0.9, while the probability of Raj being connected to Nisha is 0.1.\n4. Wim is connected to Jing, and the probability of Jing being connected to Nisha is 0.9, while the probability of Jing being connected to Wei is 0.1.\n5. We calculate the probabilities for each possible path from Vicky:\n   a. Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> Moin -> Kim -> Nisha -> Jing -> Sara\n      Probability = 1 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 0.9 * 1 = 0.6561\n   b. Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara -> Jing -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja\n      Probability = 1 * 0.9 * 0.1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 0.081\n   c. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> Raj\n      Probability = 1 * 1 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 0.1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 0.081\n   d. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Wei -> Raj -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> Moin -> Kim -> Nisha -> Sara\n      Probability = 1 * 1 * 0.1 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 0.9 * 1 = 0.0495\n\nBased on the calculations, the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is achieved through path a: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja -> Moin -> Kim -> Nisha -> Jing -> Sara.\n\nTherefore, the scholar from Vicky that will lead to this path is Amir.\n\nAnswer: Amir"
