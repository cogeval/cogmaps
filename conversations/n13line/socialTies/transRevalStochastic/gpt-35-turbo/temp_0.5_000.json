Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Option 1: Nora \u2192 Peter \u2192 Shikha \u2192 Gal \u2192 Alex \u2192 David ($1M investment). Option 2: Philip \u2192 Yakub \u2192 Ajay \u2192 Joe \u2192 Rachel \u2192 Harry ($5M budget). As we can see, option 2 leads to a higher amount of money. Therefore, Philip is the friend that leads to the path where one can find the most money.\n\nAnswer: Philip"

The expected value of this path is $1M x 0.01 = $10,000.\n- Probability of reaching David through Shikha is 0.1 x 0.9 = 0.09. The expected value of this path is $1M x 0.09 = $90,000.\n- Therefore, the expected value of option 1 is $100,000.\n\nOption 2: \n- Probability of reaching Joe through Ajay is 0.9 x 0.1 = 0.09. The expected value of this path is $0.\n- Probability of reaching Harry through Rachel is 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81. The expected value of this path is $5M x 0.81 = $4,050,000.\n- Therefore, the expected value of option 2 is $4,050,000.\n\nAs we can see, option 2 leads to a much higher expected value. Therefore, Yakub is the friend that leads to the path where one can find the most money.\n\nAnswer: Yakub"
