Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara\n\nNow, let's count the number of books donated by each scholar in each path:\n\n1. Vicky (0 books) -> Amir (0 books) -> Raj (0 books) -> Wei (0 books) -> Reza (0 books) -> Ian (0 books) -> Puja (10 books)\nTotal books: 10 books\n\n2. Vicky (0 books) -> Wim (0 books) -> Jing (0 books) -> Nisha (0 books) -> Kim (0 books) -> Moin (0 books) -> Sara (50 books)\nTotal books: 50 books\n\nBased on the counts, the second path leads to the maximum number of books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is:\nVicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja\n   - Probability: 1 (Vicky to Amir) * 0.9 (Amir to Raj) * 0.9 (Raj to Wei) * 1 (Wei to Reza) * 1 (Reza to Ian) * 1 (Ian to Puja)\n   - Total probability: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81\n\n2. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara\n   - Probability: 1 (Vicky to Wim) * 0.1 (Wim to Jing) * 0.9 (Jing to Nisha) * 1 (Nisha to Kim) * 1 (Kim to Moin) * 1 (Moin to Sara)\n   - Total probability: 0.1 * 0.9 = 0.09\n\nBased on the probabilities, the first path has a higher probability of getting the maximum number of books. Therefore, the scholar from Vicky that leads to the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is Amir.\n\nAnswer: Amir"
