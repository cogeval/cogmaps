Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Choosing Amir leads us to Raj.\n3. Raj is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Ian.\n6. Ian is connected to Puja, who donates 10 books (but we don't take any).\n\nNow, let's explore the other branch:\n\n1. From Vicky, we have two choices: Amir and Wim.\n2. Choosing Wim leads us to Jing.\n3. Jing is connected to Nisha.\n4. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n5. Kim is connected to Moin.\n6. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate (but we don't take any).\n\nComparing the two paths, we see that the second path leads to a higher number of books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books. Which scholar from Vicky will lead to the path where one can achieve the highest probability of getting maximum number of books?"

Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja: \n\n   The probability of this path is: 1 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 0.729\n\n2. Vicky - Amir - Raj - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara:\n\n   The probability of this path is: 1 * 0.9 * 0.1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 0.09\n\n3. Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara:\n\n   The probability of this path is: 1 * 0.1 * 0.9 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 0.09\n\nTherefore, the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is Path 1: Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir."
