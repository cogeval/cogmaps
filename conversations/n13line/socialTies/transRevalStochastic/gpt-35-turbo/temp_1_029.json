Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Let's compare the number of books available in each path:\n\nPath 1: Vicky \u2192 Amir \u2192 Raj \u2192 Wei \u2192 Reza \u2192 Ian \u2192 Puja (10 books)\nPath 2: Vicky \u2192 Wim \u2192 Jing \u2192 Nisha \u2192 Kim \u2192 Moin \u2192 Sara (50 books)\n\nClearly, Path 2 has a higher number of books. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is:\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.
