Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

We know that Raj is connected to Wei and Wei is connected to Reza, who is connected to Ian, who is connected to Puja. However, none of these scholars have any books to donate, so we cannot proceed further along this path.\n\nLet's consider the other option. Jing is connected to Nisha with a probability of 0.9 and to Wei with a probability of 0.1. \nSince the probability of Jing being connected to Nisha is higher, we choose Jing as the next scholar in the path.\n\nNow, we need to consider the connections from Jing. We know that Jing is connected to Nisha, who is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin, who is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate. This path leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the scholar from Vicky that will lead to the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is Jing.\n\nAnswer: Jing"
