Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

If we follow the path to Wei, we will eventually reach Puja who is donating 10 books. \n\nThe second path is Vicky to Wim to Jing, where Jing is connected to Nisha with a probability of 0.9 and to Wei with a probability of 0.1. If we follow the path to Nisha, we will eventually reach Sara who is donating 50 books. \n\nGiven that the second path leads to a larger number of books and has a higher probability, the scholar from Vicky that will lead to this path is Wim.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
