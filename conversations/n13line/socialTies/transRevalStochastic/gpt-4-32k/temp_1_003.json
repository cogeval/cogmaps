Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

From Vicky, the first path goes through Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and Puja. This path results in 10 books.\n2. The second path from Vicky goes through Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara. This path results in 50 books.\n\nAfter comparing, it's clear that the path with the most books is the second path. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

The path through Amir: This path has a probability of 0.9 to reach Wei and further to reach 10 books. Even though it has a 0.1 chance to connect to Nisha, the path doesn't lead to the maximum number of books.\n\n2. The path through Wim: This path has a probability of 0.9 to reach Nisha and further to reach 50 books. Also, it has a 0.1 chance to connect to Wei but this path doesn't lead to the maximum number of books.\n\nComparing the probabilities, it's clear that going through Wim offers the highest probability of reaching the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
