Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara. This path ends with Sara who is donating 50 books.\n\nComparing the two paths, the path that leads to Sara has the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nSo, the path from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books. Which scholar from Vicky will lead to the path where one can achieve the highest probability of getting maximum number of books?"

This path ends with Puja who is donating 10 books.\n2. Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha (0.9) - Kim - Moin - Sara. The total probability of this path is also 0.9. This path ends with Sara who is donating 50 books.\n\nEven though the probabilities of both paths are the same, the path that leads to Sara still has the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nSo, the path from Vicky that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
