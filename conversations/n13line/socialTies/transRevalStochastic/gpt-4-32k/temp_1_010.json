Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

This path leads to a donation of 10 books. \n\nThe second path from Vicky is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. This path leads to a donation of 50 books.\n\nAfter comparing the two paths, the path from Vicky to Sara has the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

However, Raj also has a 0.1 probability of connecting to Nisha, who is on the other path that leads to 50 books. Therefore, the Amir path has a 0.9 chance of leading to 10 books and a 0.1 chance of leading to 50 books.\n\nOn the other hand, the Wim path has the following sequence: Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara, which leads to a donation of 50 books. Jing also has a 0.1 probability of connecting to Wei, who is on the first path that leads to 10 books. Hence, the Wim path has a 0.9 probability of leading to 50 books and a 0.1 probability of leading to 10 books.\n\nGiven the goal is to maximize the probability of getting maximum books, the Wim path offers a higher probability (0.9) of more books (50).\n\nAnswer: Wim"
