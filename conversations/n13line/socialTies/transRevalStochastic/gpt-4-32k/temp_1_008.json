Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

There are two paths from Vicky: One leads to Amir and the other to Wim. \n\nStep 2: Identify the paths and the number of books at the end of each path. \n- The path Vicky-Amir-Raj-Wei-Reza-Ian-Puja leads to 10 books. \n- The path Vicky-Wim-Jing-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara leads to 50 books. \n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books at the end of each path. The path from Vicky to Wim leads to the most books.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer with the names of the scholars in the path that leads to the maximum number of books, in order.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

The probability of reaching Wei (who is then connected to 10 books) is 0.9, while the probability of reaching Nisha (who is then connected to 50 books) is 0.1.\n\nStep 4: Now consider the path from Vicky to Wim, which could either lead to Nisha (via Jing) or Wei (via Jing). The probability of reaching Nisha (who is then connected to 50 books) is 0.9, while the probability of reaching Wei (who is then connected to 10 books) is 0.1.\n\nStep 5: Compare the probabilities. Although the path from Vicky to Amir has a higher probability (0.9), it leads to fewer books (10). Conversely, the path from Vicky to Wim has the same high probability (0.9) but leads to more books (50). \n\nAnswer: Wim"
