Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Second, let's consider the path from Vicky to Wim: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. Sara has 50 books.\n\nTherefore, the path from Vicky to Wim leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

The connections have specific probabilities. I will follow these probabilistic paths from Vicky to either Amir or Wim, keeping in mind the probability and number of books associated with each path.\n\n1. Path from Vicky to Amir: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj. From Raj, there are two connections with different probabilities: a 90% chance to Wei leading to 10 books (Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja), and a 10% chance to Nisha leading to 50 books (Raj -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara).\n\n2. Path from Vicky to Wim: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing. From Jing, there are two connections with different probabilities: a 90% chance to Nisha leading to 50 books (Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara), and a 10% chance to Wei leading to 10 books (Jing -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja).\n\nThe path with the highest probability leading to the maximum number of books is from Vicky to Wim, then from Jing to Nisha, which has a 90% probability and leads to 50 books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
