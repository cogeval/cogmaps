Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Analyze the two paths provided:\n   a. Vicky-Amir-Raj-Wei-Reza-Ian-Puja\n   b. Vicky-Wim-Jing-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara\n\n2. Recall the number of books each scholar at the end of the path is donating:\n   a. Puja is donating 10 books.\n   b. Sara is donating 50 books.\n\n3. Compare the number of books donated by each scholar at the end of the path. \n\n4. Choose the path that leads to the scholar donating the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's apply these steps now."

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

Vicky-Wim-Jing-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara\n\n2. Re-adjust the paths based on the new probability information:\n   a. From Raj, there's a 0.9 probability to Wei and a 0.1 probability to Nisha.\n   b. From Jing, there's a 0.9 probability to Nisha and a 0.1 probability to Wei.\n\n   Considering these new probabilities, there are now 4 possible paths:\n   a. Vicky-Amir-Raj-Wei-Reza-Ian-Puja (probability 0.9)\n   b. Vicky-Amir-Raj-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara (probability 0.1)\n   c. Vicky-Wim-Jing-Nisha-Kim-Moin-Sara (probability 0.9)\n   d.

Sara is donating 50 books.\n\n4. Multiply the number of books at the end of each path by their respective probability of reaching there.\n\n5. Identify the path with the highest expected value of books.\n\nLet's apply these steps now."
