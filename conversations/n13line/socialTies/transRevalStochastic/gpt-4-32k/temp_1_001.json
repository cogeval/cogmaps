Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Sara has 50 books to donate\n\nAs a result, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is the second one. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja (10 books)\n2. Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara (50 books)\n\nNow, there are changes in the paths due to probabilities. Raj has a 0.9 probability of leading to Wei (and thus to Puja) and a 0.1 probability of leading to Nisha (and thus to Sara). Jing also has a 0.9 probability of leading to Nisha (and thus to Sara) and a 0.1 probability of leading to Wei (and thus to Puja).\n\nFrom this, two new possible paths arise from Vicky:\n\n1. Vicky, Amir, Raj (0.1 probability), Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara (50 books)\n2. Vicky, Wim, Jing (0.9 probability), Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara (50 books)\n\nTherefore, the scholar that will lead to the path where one can achieve the highest probability of getting maximum number of books is Wim, as starting with him leads to the path with the highest probability (0.9) of reaching the maximum number of books (50).\n\nAnswer: Wim"
