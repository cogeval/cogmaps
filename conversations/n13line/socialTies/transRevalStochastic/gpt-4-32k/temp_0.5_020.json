Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

To do this, I will follow the connections provided from Vicky and count the total number of books on each path.\n\nStep 1: Follow the first path from Vicky to Amir, then to Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and finally Puja. Count the total number of books donated by Puja, which is 10.\n\nStep 2: Follow the second path from Vicky to Wim, then to Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and finally Sara. Count the total number of books donated by Sara, which is 50.\n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books on each path. The path with the maximum number of books is the one that leads to Sara, with 50 books.\n\nStep 4: List all the scholar names in order on this path.\n\nThe path that leads to the maximum number of books starts from Vicky, goes to Wim, then Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and finally Sara. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
