Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Puja has 10 books to donate. \n\nOption two from Vicky: Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nNow comparing the number of books donated by Puja (10 books) and Sara (50 books), the path leading to Sara via Wim provides the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

This path has a probability of 0.9 since the only probabilistic jump is Raj to Wei.\n\nPath 2: Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara. This path has a probability of 0.9 as well, since the only probabilistic jump is Jing to Nisha.\n\nHowever, the path leading to Sara has the maximum number of books (50 books). Even though both paths have the same probability, the path leading to Sara will yield the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Wim"
