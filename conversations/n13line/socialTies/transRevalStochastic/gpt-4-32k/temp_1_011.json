Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Puja is donating 10 books.\n\nThe second path includes Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin and Sara. Sara is donating 50 books. \n\nComparing the two paths, the second path leads to a larger number of donated books. \n\nTherefore, the path with the maximum number of books is the second one that includes Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin and Sara. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

Raj is connected to Wei with a probability of 0.9, but he is also connected to Nisha with a probability of 0.1.\n2. Jing is connected to Nisha with a probability of 0.9, but is also connected to Wei with a probability of 0.1.\n\nWe already know from the previous step that the path to Sara (via Wim) results in the maximum number of books.\n\nTo determine the scholar from Vicky that leads to the highest probability of getting maximum books, we need to evaluate the new probabilities.\n\nChoosing Amir from Vicky would initially lead us to Raj. From Raj, with a higher probability, we'd reach Wei, and eventually end at Puja, who is donating 10 books.\n\nChoosing Wim from Vicky leads us to Jing, and from Jing, with the higher probability, we would get to Nisha, and finally to Sara, who is donating 50 books.\n\nThe path that has the highest probability of getting to the maximum number of books is thus choosing Wim from Vicky.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
