Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky.

There are two main paths starting from Vicky, and each has different sub-paths based on the probabilities given. \n\nPath 1: Vicky to Amir, then Amir to Raj, and Raj has two sub-paths:\n  Sub-Path 1.1: Raj to Wei (probability 0.9), Wei to Reza, Reza to Ian, Ian to Puja with 10 books.\n  Sub-Path 1.2: Raj to Nisha (probability 0.1), further connections are not mentioned and we don't know if this leads to any books.\n\nPath 2: Vicky to Wim, then Wim to Jing, and Jing has two sub-paths:\n  Sub-Path 2.1: Jing to Nisha (probability 0.9), Nisha to Kim, Kim to Moin, Moin to Sara with 50 books.\n  Sub-Path 2.2: Jing to Wei (probability 0.1), further connections are not mentioned and we don't know if this leads to any books.\n\nSince Sub-Path 2.1 leads to the maximum number of books and has a higher probability compared to Sub-Path 1.1, Path 2 is the one to choose to achieve the highest probability of getting maximum books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
