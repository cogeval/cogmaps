Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

There are two paths from Vicky: one goes through Amir and the other through Wim.\n\nStep 2: Identify the two paths and their respective book donations. \n\nPath 1: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja. This path leads to Puja who is donating 10 books.\n\nPath 2: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. This path leads to Sara who is donating 50 books.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books in each path. Path 1 leads to 10 books, while path 2 leads to 50 books.\n\nStep 4: Determine which path leads to the maximum number of books. In this case, it's Path 2.\n\nStep 5: List all scholar names in the path that leads to the maximum number of books, in order.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books. Which scholar from Vicky will lead to the path where one can achieve the highest probability of getting maximum number of books?"

This path has a probability of 0.9 (Raj to Wei).\n\nPath 2: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. This path has a probability of 0.9 (Jing to Nisha).\n\nStep 3: Both paths have the same probability, but we know from the previous question that Path 2 leads to more books (50 books compared to 10).\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the path that has the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books is Path 2.\n\nStep 5: The scholar from Vicky that will lead to this path is Wim.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
