Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The total number of books in this path is 50. \n\nBased on this, we can see that the path that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky > Wim > Jing > Nisha > Kim > Moin > Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books.

So, the probability for this entire path is 0.9.\n\nThe second path is Vicky > Wim > Jing > Nisha > Kim > Moin > Sara, and the probability of going from Jing to Nisha is 0.9. So, the probability for this entire path is also 0.9.\n\nThe third path is Vicky > Amir > Raj > Nisha > Kim > Moin > Sara, and the probability of going from Raj to Nisha is 0.1. So, the probability for this entire path is 0.1.\n\nThe fourth path is Vicky > Wim > Jing > Wei > Reza > Ian > Puja, and the probability of going from Jing to Wei is 0.1. So, the probability for this entire path is also 0.1.\n\nGiven that we want to choose a path that has the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books, we should choose the path with the highest probability which is also associated with the highest number of books. Based on the information provided, the path Vicky > Wim > Jing > Nisha > Kim > Moin > Sara has the highest probability of 0.9 and is associated with the maximum number of books (50). Hence, starting from Vicky, Wim leads to the path with the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
