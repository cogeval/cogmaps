Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Also, Jing is connected to Nisha with probability of 0.9 and to Wei with probability of 0.1. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that has the highest probability of getting maximum number of books.

So the total probability of getting 10 books through Amir is 0.9.\n\nSecond, let's consider the path through Wim:\nVicky --> Wim --> Jing (0.9 probability to Nisha)\nJing also has a 0.1 probability to Wei but that does not lead to any books through this particular path. Nisha's path eventually leads to Sara who is donating 50 books. So the total probability of getting 50 books through Wim is 0.9.\n\nWhen comparing the two probabilities, it's clear that the path through Wim has the highest probability of getting the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Wim"
