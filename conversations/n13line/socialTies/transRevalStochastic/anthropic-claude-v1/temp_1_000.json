Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Rachel's brother Harry has $5M to invest.\n4. Between the two options, Rachel's brother Harry can invest more money ($5M) compared to David ($1M).\n5.

If you talk to Nora, Peter can introduce you to Shikha (0.1 probability) who then introduces you to Gal and Alex, leading to $1M from David. Peter can also introduce you to Ajay (0.9 probability) who leads to $5M from Harry.\n3. If you talk to Philip, Yakub can introduce you to Shikha (0.9 probability) who leads to $1M. Yakub can also introduce you to Ajay (0.1 probability) who leads to $5M.\n4. The path with the highest probability of leading to the most money ($5M) is through Peter (0.9 chance of introducing you to Ajay) or through Yakub (0.1 chance of introducing you to Ajay). \n5. Between Peter (0.9 chance) and Yakub (0.1 chance), Peter has a higher probability of leading to Ajay and $5M.\n\nAnswer: Nora"
