Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from Vicky, we have two choices: Amir and Wim. Since we want to maximize the number of books, we need to find which path leads to the most books.\n\n2. From Amir, we can connect to Raj. \n\n3. From Raj, we can connect to Wei.\n\n4. From Wei, we can connect to Reza.\n\n5. From Reza, we can connect to Ian.\n\n6. From Ian, we can connect to Puja who is donating 10 books.\n\n7. Since Puja only has 10 books to donate, we should not take this path.\n\n8. Now, let's go back to Vicky and explore the other option, Wim.\n\n9. From Wim, we can connect to Jing.\n\n10. From Jing, we can connect to Nisha.\n\n11. From Nisha, we can connect to Kim.\n\n12. From Kim, we can connect to Moin.\n\n13. From Moin, we can connect to Sara who has 50 books to donate.\n\nSo, the path starting from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

Comparing the options, we can see that Puja donating 60 books is the better choice.\n\n8. Now, let's go back to Vicky and explore the other option, Wim.\n\n9. From Wim, we can connect to Jing.\n\n10. From Jing, we can connect to Nisha.\n\n11. From Nisha, we can connect to Kim.\n\n12. From Kim, we can connect to Moin.\n\n13. From Moin, we have two options: Sara (50 books) and the updated option where Sara is still donating the same number of books.\n\n14.
