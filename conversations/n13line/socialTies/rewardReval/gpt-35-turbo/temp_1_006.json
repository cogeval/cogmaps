Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Nisha is connected to Kim.\n6.

Moin is connected to Sara. We know that Sara is donating the same number of books as before, which is 50.\n\n8. Ian is connected to Puja. We know that Puja is donating 60 books.\n\nComparing the two potential paths:\n\nPath 1: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin - Total books: 0 (no donations)\n\nPath 2: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara - Total books: 50\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
