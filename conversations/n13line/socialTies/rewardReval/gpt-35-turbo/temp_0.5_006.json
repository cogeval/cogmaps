Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

From Amir, we know that he is connected to Raj.\n3. From Raj, we know that he is connected to Wei.\n4. From Wei, we know that he is connected to Reza.\n5. From Reza, we know that he is connected to Ian.\n6. From Ian, we know that he is connected to Puja, who is donating 10 books.\n\nSo far, we have the path: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja (10 books)\n\nNow, let's continue from Vicky's other choice, Wim:\n\n7. From Wim, we know that he is connected to Jing.\n8. From Jing, we know that she is connected to Nisha.\n9. From Nisha, we know that she is connected to Kim.\n10. From Kim, we know that she is connected to Moin.\n11. From Moin, we know that he is connected to Sara.\n12. From Sara, we know that she has 50 books to donate.\n\nSo, the second path is: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara (50 books)\n\nComparing the two paths, we can see that the second path leads to the maximum number of books (50 books).\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

You are also told that from Moin, if you get connected to Sara, she is donating  same number of books as before. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.

From Amir, we know that he is connected to Raj.\n3. From Raj, we know that he is connected to Wei.\n4. From Wei, we know that he is connected to Reza.\n5. From Reza, we know that he is connected to Ian.\n6. From Ian, we have two choices: Puja (10 books) and Puja (60 books).\n\nConsidering the maximum number of books, we choose the path with Puja donating 60 books:\n\nVicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja (60 books)\n\nNow, let's continue from Vicky's other choice, Wim:\n\n7. From Wim, we know that he is connected to Jing.\n8. From Jing, we know that she is connected to Nisha.\n9. From Nisha, we know that she is connected to Kim.\n10. From Kim, we know that she is connected to Moin.\n11. From Moin, we know that he is connected to Sara (50 books).\n\nSo, the second path remains the same: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara (50 books).\n\nComparing the two paths, the first path with Puja donating 60 books leads to a higher number of books.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja"
