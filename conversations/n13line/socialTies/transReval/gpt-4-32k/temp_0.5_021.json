Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Each path leads to a different scholar who has a certain number of books to donate. The task is to find out which path leads to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 2: Identify the two paths. The first path from Vicky goes through Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, and ends at Puja who has 10 books. The second path from Vicky goes through Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and ends at Sara who has 50 books.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books at the end of each path. Puja has 10 books while Sara has 50 books.\n\nStep 4: Determine the path that leads to the scholar with the maximum number of books. The path to Sara has more books.\n\nStep 5: List all scholar names in order on the path that leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
