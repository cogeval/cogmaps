Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. This path leads to Sara who has 50 books to donate.\n\nComparing the two paths, the second path from Vicky to Sara yields the maximum number of books (50 books). Hence, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

This path still leads to Puja who has 10 books to donate.\n\n2. Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. This path leads to Sara who has 50 books to donate.\n\n3. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara. This path leads to Sara with 50 books to donate.\n\n4. Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja. This path leads to Puja who has 10 books to donate.\n\nComparing the above paths, paths 2 and 3 both lead to Sara with 50 books to donate. However, path 2 has one less connection, so it is more efficient. Therefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books and has fewer connections is Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
