Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Each choice represents a different path and we are asked to choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nPath 1, through Amir:\nVicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja. The number of books at the end of this path is 10.\n\nPath 2, through Wim:\nVicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. The number of books at the end of this path is 50.\n\nComparing the two paths, Path 2 through Wim leads to the maximum number of books. Therefore, the order of scholars from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

This path ends with Sara who has 50 books.\n   \n2. Wim, then to Jing, and now we can go to Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja who has 10 books. Alternatively from Jing we could also go to Nisha, Kim, Moin and Sara. This path also ends with Sara who has 50 books. \n\nSince both paths lead to Sara who has 50 books, we have multiple paths to get the maximum number of books. However, the path through Amir is shorter so we'll select that one. \n\nSo, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
