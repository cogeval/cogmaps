Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The two paths that have been provided are as follows:\n\nPath 1: Vicky -> Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza -> Ian -> Puja, with 10 books at the end.\nPath 2: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara, with 50 books at the end.\n\nIn the scenario, no scholar along the path gives any books, only Puja and Sara donate books at the ends of their respective paths.\n\nI will compare the number of books at the end of each path, and determine the path that leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nBased on the comparison, Path 2 leads to 50 books, which is more than the 10 books at the end of Path 1. \n\nHence, starting from Vicky, the path that will lead to the maximum number of books is Path 2. \n\nSo, the order of the scholars, separated by commas, would be Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. \n\nLet's format the final answer following the regular expression."
