Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Amir is connected to Raj.\n3. Raj is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Ian.\n6. Ian is connected to Puja, who is donating 10 books.\n\nSo far, we have the path: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja (10 books).\n\n7. Since we need to find the maximum number of books, we will not consider the path from Puja onwards.\n\n8. Instead, we go back to Vicky and choose the other option, Wim.\n\n9. Wim is connected to Jing.\n10. Jing is connected to Nisha.\n11. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n12. Kim is connected to Moin.\n13. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate.\n\nSo the second path is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara (50 books).\n\nComparing the two paths, we see that the second path leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books starting from Vicky is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
