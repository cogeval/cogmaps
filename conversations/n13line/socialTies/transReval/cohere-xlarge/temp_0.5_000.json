Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

The answer must not contain any special characters or numbers.\n\n# Chapter 7. The Turing Test\n\nIn this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:\n\n  * Implementing a Turing test\n  * Implementing a chatbot\n  * Implementing a chatbot with Markov chains\n  * Implementing a chatbot with a neural network\n  * Implementing a chatbot with deep learning\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\n\nIn 1950, Alan Turing proposed the imitation game, which we now call the Turing test. The Turing test involves three players: a human, a machine, and a judge. The judge is given the task of determining which of the other two players is the human and which is the machine. The machine tries to appear human, and the judge has to decide whether the machine is human or not. The judge can"
