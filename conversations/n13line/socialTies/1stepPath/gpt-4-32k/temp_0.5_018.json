Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

This is a problem of choosing between two paths: Vicky to Amir to Raj to Wei to Reza to Ian to Puja who has 10 books or Vicky to Wim to Jing to Nisha to Kim to Moin to Sara who has 50 books. \n\nStep 1: Consider the first path from Vicky to Puja. The total number of books at the end of this path is 10.\n\nStep 2: Consider the second path from Vicky to Sara. The total number of books at the end of this path is 50.\n\nStep 3: Compare the total number of books from each path. The second path from Vicky to Sara has more books.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the path from Vicky to Sara via Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, and Moin is the one that leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
