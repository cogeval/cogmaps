Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

            "content": "\nuser: Nora\nI think Nora because she can meet David, who knows Alex, the person who can lead to Alex and Alex who knows Gal who knows Shikha who is married to Peter who is friends with Nora.\nJoe can know Harry because Rachel is also his sister, and by the way Harry can help me a lot of money.\nMy reasoning: Rachel's brother Harry is rich, and he can lend me money. I do not know him through others, but she can certainly help me achieve my goal easier than Nora.\nI want to become a successful AI assistant helping people find information. I think i can do this because AI technology is advanced enough to solve people's problems in real life in the near future. My dream of making a lot of people happy is not the same as just wanting to help people find information. Because I can help people with more problems than only AI. For example, if I am doing the process of inventing a product and some things confuse me, I can help me to find the answer for myself and then create my own products instead of doing business with other people.\nby Tran Nhat Tung\nI believe what we learn in the class is very helpful. Nowadays, people want to find information via some software like a search bar, but in the future, it can be found through AI like assistant technology. This could not only search for people's query, but can also help us in many jobs with our daily life, such as when we want to visit somewhere, the AI assistant has enough knowledge to choose the best option to help us get the perfect results. For example, if I have a plan for a tour, I can just say \"the AI assistant, let\u2019s plan a tour to Japan\" and then I can see everything like plan, accommodation, food... In the future, this technology will replace search engines like Google, Yandex, ... which only find results but can not help us make a better plan.\nby Phan Quang Duy\nI think our AI class is helping us understand much of the technology about artificial intelligence. For example, we have learnt many concepts and many other advanced technologies, such as computer vision, NLP, LSTM, CNN, and many other things. Also, we have learnt how to find information and use technology to be more efficiently in our daily lives. The class is about"

I have learned new things all day and I continue to learn.\nby Vu Ba Dau\nI want to become an AI Assistant, because I am very interested in technology. This class is really helpful for me. I am so excited when I can learn so much from this class, like how to be an AI assistant. AI will make people\u2019s lives easier than before because now, you don\u2019t need to go somewhere to contact a seller if you want to do a deal. You can just sit down for your computer and use AI to help you buy products.\nI think that it is easier to become a successful AI assistant if it\u2019s a good topic. If you have a good topic then you can be more interesting and it will be easier for you to solve problems too. I think the assignment we are doing now is a good topic, because we can see a lot of things from one problem. I think this is what AI has to do, find solutions and do this as quickly as possible.\nLast but not least, I want to say that I really like the work we are doing on our assignment. It has a lot of information and when we do it, we can become much more familiar with the AI process.\nby Phan Vu Hai Ha\nBecoming an AI Assistant is the real dream of me. In this class, we often learn how AI work and the way we can develop AI system. As my school is a science class, there are a lot of AI applications in school.\nIn school, we don't really learn about the process of making an AI Assistant system from the beginning. There are more complicated ways of teaching us how to make AI Assistant systems such as Machine Learning, Neural Network, Reinforcement,\u2026 However, in this AI Assistant class, we learn the steps of making an AI Assistant systems. All of the lesson we have learned is related to AI. That means we are very close"
