Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

Connecting to Amir yields Ian next then reaching Reza then Nisha and ends there (no more connection for books after Nisha): And the other choice connecting thru JIng yield Moin then connecting Kim the cycle repeats with Moin and returns Viki in circle with no progress further..  \nConnecthing Wi,Vikky first path leads to more than books thus, more valuable for gather info first step\nThe path Vicky -> Amir and Then Amit leads ti more progression books hence that lead to higher book' total, and more chance getting a variety of texts for info seek.
