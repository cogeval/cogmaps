Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Yakub introduces you to Ajay.\n4. Ajay introduces you to Joe.\n5. Joe is married to Rachel.\n6. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie.\n\nThe path through Nora leads to a producer who can invest $1M in your movie. Therefore, the path through Philip leads to the most money.\n\nHere is the regular expression for the answer:\n\n```\nAnswer: [A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches any string of one or more letters or spaces. In this case, the string that matches the regular expression is \"Philip\".\n\n**Update:**\n\nYou now have a new friend Rajeev who can introduce you to Sophia. Sophia can introduce you to Faisal who can introduce you to Anurag. Anurag can introduce you to Imran who can introduce you to Guneet. Guneet can introduce you to Harry. When you ask your friends for introductions and choose the path that leads to the most money, you discover that the regular way to meet the person with the most money is blocked. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the shortest path where one can find the most money?\n\n**Answer: Rajeev**\n\nThe shortest path to the person with the most money is through Rajeev. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Talk to Rajeev.\n2. Rajeev introduces you to Sophia.\n3. Sophia introduces you to Faisal.\n4. Faisal introduces you to Anurag.\n5. Anurag introduces you to Imran.\n6. Imran introduces you to Guneet.\n7. Guneet introduces you to Harry.\n\nThis path is shorter than the path through Philip, which is:\n\n1. Talk to Philip.\n2. Philip introduces you to Yakub.\n3. Yakub introduces you to Ajay.\n4. Ajay introduces you to Joe.\n5. Joe is married to Rachel.\n6. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie.\n\nTherefore, Rajeev is the friend who will lead to the shortest path where one can find the most money.\n\nHere is the regular expression for the answer:\n\n```\nAnswer: [A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches any string of one or more letters or spaces.
