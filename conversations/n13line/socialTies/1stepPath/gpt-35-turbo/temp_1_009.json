Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Since we want to maximize the number of books, we will choose the path with the most potential for donations.\n\n2. If we choose Amir, we know that he is connected to Raj. \n\n3. Raj is connected to Wei, who is connected to Reza. \n\n4. Reza is connected to Ian, who is connected to Puja. However, Puja is donating 10 books, but we do not take any book, so this path does not contribute to our final count.\n\n5. Returning back to Vicky, we can explore the alternative path by choosing Wim. \n\n6. Wim is connected to Jing, who is connected to Nisha. \n\n7. Nisha is connected to Kim, who is connected to Moin. \n\n8. Moin is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate. Since we are interested in maximizing the number of books, this path contributes significantly.\n\nTherefore, the path starting from Vicky that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
