Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

If we choose Amir:\n   - Amir is connected to Raj, who is not donating any books.\n   - Raj is connected to Wei, who is not donating any books.\n   - Wei is connected to Reza, who is not donating any books.\n   - Reza is connected to Ian, who is not donating any books.\n   - Ian is connected to Puja, who is donating 10 books.\n\n2. If we choose Wim:\n   - Wim is connected to Jing, who is not donating any books.\n   - Jing is connected to Nisha, who is not donating any books.\n   - Nisha is connected to Kim, who is not donating any books.\n   - Kim is connected to Moin, who is connected to Sara, who is donating 50 books.\n\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is through Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara.
