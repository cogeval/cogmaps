Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Reza is connected to Ian.\n7. Ian is connected to Puja.\n8. Puja has 10 books to donate.\n\nAt this point, we have encountered a split in the path. We need to explore both paths to determine which one leads to the maximum number of books.\n\nPath 1:\n9. We continue from Puja and connect to Jing.\n10. Jing is connected to Nisha.\n11. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n12. Kim is connected to Moin.\n13. Moin is connected to Sara.\n14. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nPath 2:\n9. We go back to Vicky and choose Wim.\n10. Wim is connected to Jing.\n11. Jing is connected to Nisha.\n12. Nisha is connected to Kim.\n13. Kim is connected to Moin.\n14. Moin is connected to Sara.\n15. Sara has 50 books to donate.\n\nComparing the two paths, we see that both paths lead to the same scholar names in the same order. Therefore, both paths will result in the same maximum number of books, which is 50.\n\nFinal outcome: Answer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
