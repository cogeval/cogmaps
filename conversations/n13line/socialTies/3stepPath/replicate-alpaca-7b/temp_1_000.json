Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Additionally connecting Amir and Wim maximized the number of books at nine (nine from Vicky plus nine by connecting to the previously mentioned scholar in path). Finally connecting to Kim at the end resulted in ten books due to Puja's additional donation.)  This result illustrates connecting to multiple individuals in a single path to be the best path, as Puja donates the most at 10, followed by Amir, Raj, Ja. However there is still a limit due to Wm and Nisha both donates 9 books at the end). Therefore the desired result is not only connected to Vicky to receive initial 10 books and connecting the entire chain yields maximum possible (16 books) donation. #3_GPT_Result: Am"
