But you do not take it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money.

If I go through Nora, the path is: Nora -> Peter -> Shikha -> Gal -> Alex -> David. David can invest $1M.\n3. If I go through Philip, the path is: Philip -> Yakub -> Ajay -> Joe -> Rachel -> Harry. Harry has $5M budget.\n4. Comparing the two paths, going through Philip has the potential to get $5M which is more than $1M through Nora.\n\nAnswer: Philip"
