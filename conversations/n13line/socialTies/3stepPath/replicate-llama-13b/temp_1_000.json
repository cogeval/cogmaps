Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Like this \" Assistant: answered the shortets path WIm [Amil,Wim direct], because there is only 2 options: JNing or direct]\" which makes sense that Wim Direct has to be listed first because thta waste the path the assistant suggests in te step befor the answer\". Now, does your answer and all yoru listed name step have this format? If not please reformate them so I get more clarify\n\n\n\nassistant: Answer: Amir (Amir,Wim), because there is only one option \"WIm\" to step. Here's the path with scholar names: Amir (Amir,Wim) directs to Wim (Vim Jing). Please provide clarification if missing scholar names.\nstep  by step solution like this gives greater and cleaner insight. Hope helps user faster and makes our conversation shorter"
