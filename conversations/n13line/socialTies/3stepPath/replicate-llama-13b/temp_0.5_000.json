Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

To maximize the number of books, I should choose a path that connects me to as many scholars as possible.\nStep 1: I will ask Vicky to connect me to Wim. This will give me two options: Wim and Jing.\nStep 2: I will choose to connect with Jing, as she is connected to Nisha, who has 50 books to donate.\nStep 3: I will ask Nisha to connect me to Kim, who is connected to Moin.\nStep 4: I will choose to connect with Moin, as she is connected to Sara, who has 50 books to donate.\nTherefore, the path that leads to the maximum number of books is: Vicky -> Wim -> Jing -> Nisha -> Kim -> Moin -> Sara.\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."
