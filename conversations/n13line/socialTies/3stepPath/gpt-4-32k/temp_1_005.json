Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

One path leads to Puja who has 10 books, while the other path leads to Sara who has 50 books. To find the path that leads to the maximum number of books, we compare the number of books at the end of both paths.\n\nStep 1: Analyze path one. The order of scholars is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja.\n\nStep 2: Analyze path two. The order of scholars is: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara.\n\nStep 3: Compare the number of books at the end of each path. Puja has 10 books while Sara has 50 books.\n\nStep 4: Determine that the path that leads to the maximum number of books is the one that ends with Sara, since 50 books is more than 10.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
