Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Would V\nick and Amirth start their trip at this optimimum selection path starting with Wim without worrying about whether any issues will happen before finishing? (Is it rock solid, or is one better path still?). In real- world terms, assume that time, transport cost in the case were any actual journey had to take plaee).  And so do those pathways incur any significant negative external costs. And last would be time required/wasted when using either the other non-optimum and cost path choices and time used here from this Wim path.  In terms  how we choose out actions, the path cost-effectively provides the highest reward or number oof objective functions (5 optimising object) to V ick\nAssistant: Sure I can answer  all  of these inquiries using cost accounting ideas?

I will refer t Wim then and any time, it may save clarificatiin for some, that this part of a large networ in question i s VICKYs network of interest donors? Let me begin that i s optimal or nearl cost effectively doable!   WIH VIc k you start at (connected with Jing (no book donation), Re za( no t book), PUJa has ten books), WIU can provide five book donatio i to you rightaway...and NISHA ( three  boom), SAR  I would like now ro consider the non optimal solution (which costs VIC)K something...\nNow i ask yo ur qaestion again!"
