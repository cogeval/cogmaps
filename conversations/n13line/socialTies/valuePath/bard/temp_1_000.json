Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Therefore, Philip's path leads to the path where one can find the most money.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the two paths:\n\n**Nora's path:**\n\n1. Nora is married to Peter.\n2. Peter is friends with Shikha.\n3. Shikha knows Gal.\n4. Gal can introduce you to Alex.\n5. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie.\n\n**Philip's path:**\n\n1. Philip is friends with Yakub.\n2. Yakub can introduce you to Ajay.\n3. Ajay is friends with Joe.\n4. Joe is married to Rachel.\n5. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie.\n\nAs you can see, Philip's path leads to a producer who can invest $5M in your movie, while Nora's path leads to a producer who can invest $1M in your movie. Therefore, Philip's path leads to the path where one can find the most money.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned in your question, you are just learning about the environment and are not interested in taking any money at this time. In this case, it does not matter which friend you talk to, as you will not be taking any money from them."
