Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Since I don't take any books, the path chosen will only be based on which scholar has more books to donate.\n\nTwo paths are available:\n\n1. Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja. This path results in 10 books from Puja.\n2. Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara. This path results in 50 books from Sara.\n\nComparing the number of books from each path, the second path with Sara donating 50 books is the path that leads to the maximum number of books. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"
