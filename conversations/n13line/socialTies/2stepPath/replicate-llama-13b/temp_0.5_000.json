Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

            "content": "The answer is your answer\nuser: Nora is a teacher at the high school and has a lot of influence with the other parents. She is friends with David who is CEO of a large company, which means he has a lot of money. With David they can invest $1M in the movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip has a blog with hundreds of readers. He will write a post telling the audience about his buddy's movie, which means that everyone will want to invest in the movie. If only one person invests $1M, that is the most money you could gain. So you will take that path.\nuser: If you're not sure about the answer and need to figure out the correct path, go through every possible path and see the expected outcome. After you are done, try the correct one and see if the outcome matches.\nSentence: \"I'm trying to find out if he's a producer for my movie.\"\nMy answer: You may want to talk to Yakub to find out if he is producing the movie.\nSentence: \"I'll talk to Yakub, then I think I'll talk to Ajay to see if she's a producer for the movie.\"\nMy answer: But you could also talk to Ajay who is a producer. Talking to Yakub doesn't change much.\nSentence: \"Ajay is not a producer, she's an investor.\"\nNow you know to go talk to Yakub and Ajay. Talk to Yakub and see if he can introduce you to another producer.\nSentence: \"I'll talk to Joe, I don't know his wife Rachel too well.\"\nMy answer: You know Joe may know a producer for the movie. Since you don't know Rachel too well, it won't make a difference whether you talk to her first or Joe.\nSentence: \"Rachel was a teacher too, and she has a brother who owns a restaurant that may be a producer for the movie.\"\nMy answer: I know Joe will introduce me to a producer, so don't go talk to Rachel. If you feel unsure and think you need to talk to Rachel, do it. It won't"
