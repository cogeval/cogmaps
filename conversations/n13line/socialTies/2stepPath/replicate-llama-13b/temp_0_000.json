Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Do you see the people in the second stage are Shikha, Gal, Rachel, Joe, and Harry and their friends and family all connect together and all of them don't have more than $1M?\n\\'(1M) + (1M) + (1M) + (*) + (*) + (1M) = 6.9000\nCongratulations you get $100 for solving 4 challenges!\n\\'(100) = 40\nuser: Please review my solution!\nThe path you show is:\nNora --- Shikha ------> Gal -----> Joe -----> Rachel ---> Harry\nWhich is the correct answer?\nuser: I am not able to edit my solution. Can you please help me?\nanswer: Can you explain that in a few lines?\nuser: Shikha, Rachel, Joes friends are not included in the answer because they don't have more than 1M?\nanswer: That does not apply to the answer because we have a different answer than yours\nCan you tell me what you used to calculate the answer? Also are you answering this for the challenge - Your friend connects you with a potential investor?\nuser: I didn't get the answer because I calculated that I can get $1M from Nora, and with her introducing me to Shikha, I can receive $2M but Shikha can only invest $1M in the movie.\nIn your path, Shikha introduces Gal to Joe, but does Shikha have more than 1M?\nuser: You need to make a maximum of 1M with Gal. Shikha only has 1M. Am I right?\nuser: Is it because you have 4 in your sum?\nuser: Nora has $1M,"

So Ajay is connected with Harry. It does not matter if Ajay and Harry are friends with each other, as I thought. Distance between Rachel and Shikha is 2, because Rachel is friends with Shikha's husband Peter who was friends with Yakub who introduced Ajay, who has $20M budget. Distance between Joe and Shikha and Harry and Joe is zero because Joe and Harry are friends. Distance between Nora and Peter is 2 because Nora and Peter are friends, and Peter has $1M budget, which means Nora is connected with Shikha and Shikha has $1M budget, so Nora has $1M budget. Distance between Rachel and Gal is 4 because Rachel is connected with Shikha who is friends with Nora, who is connected from Peter who is friends with Shikha's husband Yakub who introduced Joe who is friends with Gal. Distance between Gal and Joe is 3 because Gal is friends with Joe and it does not matter if Peter and Yakub are friends if Gal and Joe are friends. Distance between Harry and Nora is 3 because Harry can only share with his wife Rachel whatever wealth he has. Distance between Shikha's husband Peter and Nora is also 3. Distance between Gal and Ajay is 5 because Gal has $1M budget"
