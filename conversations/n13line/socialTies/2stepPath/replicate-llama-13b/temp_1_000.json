Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

Let's start by understanding the task and exploring the connections among the scholars.\nFrom Vicky, we have two options: Amir and Wim.\nIf we choose Amir, we can connect to Raj, and then to Wei. This path has a total of 3 scholars: Vicky - Amir - Raj - Wei.\nIf we choose Wim, we can connect to Jing, and then to Nisha. This path has a total of 2 scholars: Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha.\nFrom Nisha, we can connect to Kim, and then to Moin. This path has a total of 2 scholars: Nisha - Kim - Moin.\nFrom Kim, we can connect to Sara, and this path has a total of 1 scholar: Kim - Sara.\nNow, let's analyze each path to determine which one leads to the maximum number of books.\nOption 1 (Choosing Amir):\nTotal scholars: 3\nBooks per scholar: 40 (Puja) + 10 (Reza) + 10 (Ian) = 60\nOption 2 (Choosing Wim):\nTotal scholars: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5\nBooks per scholar: 40 (Nisha) + 10 (Kim) + 5 (Sara) = 95\nSince the sum of books per scholar in option 2 is greater than option 1, choosing Wim will lead to the maximum number of books (95).\nPath from Vicky to the maximum number of books: Vicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Sara\n Answer: Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Sara."
