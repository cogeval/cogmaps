Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

From here, take the path towards Pam from aforementined multiple links ( I+ WMP), therefore get linked towards Sara ( Pam+S) (I anP.amSaraP), that has a whoopig maximum Fifty books that I 'll learn bout  the environment without take any. This Path explntion is only six  connections instead Pam. which am allowed cuz there is No direct route otherwise. V. IcsW JPS IAM will suffice this situation cuz all Pam'connection are considered. \n\nAssistant: Answer: v ICws I. P\nThe Assistant thinks step by step as following, to Answer this Questoin? Here we go Step#1. Connect to Jim first as he is directvly connecter2 With one individual.,Step# 2.Then Connect I t j P  Am as the Path to Sara is through Pam with one direct and multiplw links:. Pam + WMP and Pam++A  +. +I which  Pam connected Sara (1+ direct WMP, M.1P S( +0W = +(  I P Sara)=I W+ I  P). Answer will be V- ICewIP I will suffice This task well so,  thereafter one needs to take straight way without being side-Tracked\n\nThe task is a network-based puzzled you must choose the maximum path. For each point that connects. we get three options and connect the path. When someone connects through a shared, you might add one or  MOe than a shared. When no connection is given move your current path straight. Here we go step No.  1 move directlu connecting via Jim I. The shared person with Mamy+ Jimm P connects you SRA. For clarity sake my Answry will a'always b  followed by a Question as per new format Question  as in the previous one so.  Next? Shall we proceed? How much more connections will determine path\nNext?"
