Nora is married to Peter who is friends with Shikha. Shikha knows Gal who can introduce to Alex. Alex can introduce you to David, who can invest $1M in your movie. But you do not take it, you're just learning about the environment. Then you exit and start over. Philip is friends with Yakub who can introduce you to Ajay. Ajay is friends with Joe who is married to Rachel. Rachel's brother Harry has $5M budget for producing a movie. But you do not take anything, you're just learning about the environment. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the most money. Which friend of yours will lead to the path where one can find the most money?"

Alex can't introduce you directly to David since he does not know Joe. Nora and David are the only two nodes that know each other, so any path to David leads to Nora.\nShikha can introduce Nora to Alex, but Alex cannot introduce her to you because of the node limitations. Nora and David are the only two nodes that know each other, so any path to David leads to Nora.\nHarry gives $5M to Rachel's brother Joe, and no one knows Nora, so the money always ends up with Philip. We do not know about the rest of the system, so it does not matter: the money will have to go with Nora.\nI got 40. Is this the right answer?\nYou need to get the shortest path to the node with the maximum value (in case of ties, it is the first node that can be reached)\nThis one is the shortest one, and has the maximum value."
