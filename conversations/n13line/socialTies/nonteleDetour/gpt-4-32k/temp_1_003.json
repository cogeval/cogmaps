Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

The books collected on each path are mentioned but we do not actually collect any, we simply track the total amount on each path for comparison.\n\nStep 1: Trace the path from Vicky through Amir.\nThe path from Vicky through Amir is Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja. The total number of books on this path is 10.\n\nStep 2: Trace the path from Vicky through Wim.\nThe path from Vicky through Wim is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara. The total number of books on this path is 50.\n\nStep 3: Compare the totals from both paths.\nThe path from Vicky through Wim has more books (50) compared to the path from Vicky through Amir (10).\n\nStep 4: State the path with more books.\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara"

The initial path through Wim is blocked, so we have to explore the path through Amir and the new connection Ian has with Pam who has all of Moin's connections. \n\nStep 1: Trace the path from Vicky through Amir and incorporate the new connection.\nThe path from Vicky through Amir to Ian is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian. Ian is now connected to Pam, who in turn is connected to Moin's connections: Kim and Sara. Therefore, the path is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Kim, Moin, Sara. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total books on this new path.\nPuja had 10 books, and Sara, one of Moin's connections, has 50 books. So, the total number of books on this path is 60.\n\nStep 3: State the path with more books, as this is the only path available due to the blockage on the previous maximum route.\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Kim, Moin, Sara"
