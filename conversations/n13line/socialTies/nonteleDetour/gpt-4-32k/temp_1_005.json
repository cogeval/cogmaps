Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas"

It appears that there are two potential paths from Vicky, one leading to Puja who is donating 10 books and another to Sara who is donating 50 books.\n\nPath 1: \nVicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Puja.\n\nPath 2:\nVicky - Wim - Jing - Nisha - Kim - Moin - Sara.\n\nBy comparing the number of books at the end of each path (10 books from Puja in Path 1 and 50 books from Sara in Path 2), it is clear that Path 2 leads to the maximum number of books. Therefore, the sequence of scholars that leads to the maximum number of books is Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, and Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Wim, Jing, Nisha, Kim, Moin, Sara."

The next time you meet Vicky and choose the path that leads to the maximum number of books, you discover that the regular path to the scholar with the maximum number of books is blocked. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books. Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?  Please list all scholar names in order, separated by commas."

However, Ian now has a new connection to Pam, and Pam is connected to all of Moin's connections. This means Pam is also connected to Sara who has 50 books, as Sara is originally connected to Moin.\n\nSo, if starting from Vicky, we would follow Path 1 up until Ian, then divert to Pam and then follow the Path 2 from Moin to Sara:\n\nNew Path:\nVicky - Amir - Raj - Wei - Reza - Ian - Pam - Moin - Sara.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of scholars that now leads to the maximum number of books, given the new connections and blocked path, is: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, and Sara.\n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Pam, Moin, Sara."
