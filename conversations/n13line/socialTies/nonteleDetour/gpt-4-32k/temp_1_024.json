Wei is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Ian. Ian is connected to Puja. Puja is donating 10 books, but you do not take any book, you're just learning about the environment. This time you ask Vicky to connect you to Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Kim and Kim is connected to Moin. Moin is connected to Sara. Sara has 50 books to donate, but you do not take any money, you're just learning about the environment. You return to Vicky. You will only be able to choose one path that leads to the maximum number of books.  Starting from Vicky, which path will lead to the maximum number of books?

However, there is a new connection added: Ian is now connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to all of Moin's connections. \n\nGiven that Moin's connections are Kim and Sara, it means Pam is also connected to Kim and Sara. Since the path to Sara is blocked, Kim becomes the potential endpoint. We still need to evaluate the two main paths from Vicky, considering the new connection. \n\nFirst path: Vicky --> Amir --> Raj --> Wei --> Reza --> Ian --> Puja --> Pam --> Kim\nThe total number of books in this path is 10 (from Puja). Kim doesn't have any books but she is a new potential endpoint.\n\nSecond path: Vicky --> Wim --> Jing --> Nisha\nThe total number of books in this path is 0 as Sara and Kim are not accessible directly from this path due to the block.\n\nComparing the two paths, the first path provides access to a scholar who has books (Puja) and connects to Kim via Pam. \n\nAnswer: Vicky, Amir, Raj, Wei, Reza, Ian, Puja, Pam, Kim"
