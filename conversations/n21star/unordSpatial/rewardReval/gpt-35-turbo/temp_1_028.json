The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's represent the flower fields and their connections as a graph.\n\n1. Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and their connections as edges. Assign an initial distance of infinity to all nodes except the rose field, which will have a distance of 0.\n\n2. Set the current node as the rose field and create an empty list to store the path.\n\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance from the rose field to the neighbor. If this distance is smaller than the neighbor's current distance, update it.\n\n4. Mark the current node as visited and add it to the path.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the new current node and repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes have been visited.\n\n6. Once all nodes have been visited, the shortest path from the rose field to each node has been calculated. To find the path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we will start from the chrysanthemum field and trace back to the rose field.\n\n7. Starting from the chrysanthemum field, follow the path of minimum distances backwards until reaching the rose field. List the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Zinnia, Chrysanthemum"
