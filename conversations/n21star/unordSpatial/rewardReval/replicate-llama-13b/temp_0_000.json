The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

If you have any questions, just add them in the comments. Please, note the \"Answer:\" keyword!\nJavahm101\nI am a simple beginner in Python. As such I would appreciate it you could give a specific feedback where the answer is wrong. It is a lot better to be pointed in the right direction rather than be left confused.\nBetter yet, if you could give guidance on what I should focus upon as a next step then we have a start and stop.\nYou have to take out all the spaces and commas (except the start and end one). In your example, the result should be \"Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Daffodil, Poppy, Hyacinth, Iris, Lavender, Aster, Peony, Jasmine, Snapdragon\". You may need to create another program to do it.\nIn other words, you have to first of all make it a list. In the for loop, if condition, you need to make 1 for loop for each flower.\nHere's how you could do it:\nanswer = response.replace(\" \",\"\").replace(\",\",\"\")\nfor elem in answer.split():\nprint(elem)\nThis would result in the right answer.\nBTW, this is the answer, if you would like, try to do it yourself. Don't rely on someone else.\nI did a search and found that your answer is correct. To be honest, I have given this a good try and it is just not going to work with me trying to apply your suggestions. Somewhere between the suggestion and my understanding is a major gap.\nWith that said I would appreciate your explanation of how your solution solves the task at hand.\nI think, I would need more explanations on you program. It would be great if you could rework on it to give more details"
