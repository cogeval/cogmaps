The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

To find the shortest path that yields the most flowers, I recommend starting with the connected flower fields, which you need in order to reach any other field that's not bordering your starting point or reachable by bridges only, i.\"/> View Answer\n\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Hyacinth, Dahlia, Peony and Jasmine fields as all connected to each other at distance zero.. From each flower- You need first to Visit Hyacinth Fields and get 50 bunch'd Hybrid flowers. Then head on Over Dahlia then dahlia fields for Another.5 batch bunch  of Hybrid's in this case of that Field You 5.1 1/batch batch remaining bunch(51 5) that should leave enough to cover the next batch at each remaining fields Visited by your search pattern; Tulippy Jaxiney Field of Peonies is first.\nExplanation : All fields have multiple names. the Hybrid flowers from one batch with all names is included\n Answer.   Rose Hyacinth  Dally  Tulip Peony & Jaxine fields (as multiple roses appear along path, this path can take as long as a maximum as the name listed multipy over batches, or number of petal.) the name order changes with no change remaining to maximum to  total flowers acquired if path changes remainding flower bunch (to take one for free at hyacinth field for bunches free total.) minimum time, \nHint The Hyabid Hyacinfd fields 52 remain to batch  from it 5 remaining ( 1 + (-.52) 5 remain)) - one  (-51) last from jaxing Jximimax (-batch-51 last from daffidilly fld to jusyt x 5  to take bunch free  then Dael fld which  has just two) last  x 5 daflffidllty remain, in this cast zero from first three fields 42,31 & 40 as per pattern\nExplanatin.
