Start at the sunflower field.\n2. Add the sunflower field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the zinnia field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark the dequeued field as visited.\n4. If the algorithm completes without finding the zinnia field, there is no path from the sunflower field to the zinnia field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia"
