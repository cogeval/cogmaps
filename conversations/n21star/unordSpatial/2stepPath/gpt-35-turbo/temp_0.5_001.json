Start at the rose field.\n2. Add the rose field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the aster field, we have found the shortest path. Return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that haven't been visited yet.\n   - Mark the dequeued field as visited.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the aster field, there is no path from the rose field to the aster field.\n\nLet's perform the BFS and find the shortest path from the rose field to the aster field:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Aster"
