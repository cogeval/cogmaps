Starting from room 9, we can explore all adjacent rooms, then all adjacent rooms to those rooms, and so on until we reach room 24. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n- Starting from room 9, we can go to rooms 13, 21, and 41.\n- From room 13, we can go to rooms 5, 9, 21, and 24. From room 21, we can go to rooms 1, 4, 5, 9, and 13. From room 41, we can go to rooms 3, 8, and 9.\n- From room 5, we can go to rooms 13, 21, and 24. From room 24, we have reached our destination.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 9 to room 24 is: 9, 13, 5, 24.\n\nAnswer: 9, 13, 5, 24"
