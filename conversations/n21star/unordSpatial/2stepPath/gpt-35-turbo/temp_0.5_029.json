Start at the aster field.\n2. Visit the neighboring fields: lavender, snapdragon, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine.\n3. From the neighboring fields, visit their unvisited neighbors: aster, lavender, poppy, dahlia, aster, lavender, aster, lavender, aster, lavender, aster.\n4. Continue this process until the sunflower field is reached.\n\nThe shortest path from the aster field to the sunflower field, including aster, is:\n\nAnswer: aster, lavender, aster, lavender, aster, lavender, aster, sunflower"
