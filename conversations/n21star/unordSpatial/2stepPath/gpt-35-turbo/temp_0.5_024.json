Starting from the zinnia field, we will explore its connected fields first: daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation.\n2. From the daisy field, we will explore its connected fields: orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n3. From the sunflower field, we will explore its connected fields: daisy, orchid, lily, and tulip. Since the tulip field is one of the connected fields, we have found the shortest path.\n4. Therefore, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the tulip field is: zinnia, daisy, sunflower, tulip.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Daisy, Sunflower, Tulip"
