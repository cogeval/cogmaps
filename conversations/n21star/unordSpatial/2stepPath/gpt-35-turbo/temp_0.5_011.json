Start at the daisy field.\n2. Check its connections: The daisy field is connected to the tulip, zinnia, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n3. Add these fields to the queue: tulip, zinnia, hydrangea, lily.\n4. Take the next field from the queue (tulip).\n5. Check its connections: The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n6. Since we have already visited the daisy field, we can skip it.\n7. Add the remaining fields (orchid, lily, sunflower) to the queue: orchid, lily, sunflower.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until we reach the marigold field or exhaust all possible paths.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the daisy field to the marigold field is:\n\nDaisy, Lily, Sunflower, Hydrangea, Marigold\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Lily, Sunflower, Hydrangea, Marigold"
