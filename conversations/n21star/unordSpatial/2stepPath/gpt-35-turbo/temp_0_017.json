Start at the orchid field.\n2. Add the orchid field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the iris field, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighboring fields of the dequeued field that have not been visited yet.\n   - Mark the dequeued field as visited.\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from the orchid field to the iris field.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the orchid field to the iris field is:\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Aster, Dahlia, Lavender, Iris"
