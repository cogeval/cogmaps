Daisy field is not directly connected to the hyacinth field, so we need to find an alternative route.\n5. Daisy field is connected to the tulip field.\n6. Tulip field is connected to the orchid, lily, sunflower, and daisy fields (already visited).\n7. Orchid field has already been visited, so we cannot go back to it.\n8. Lily field has already been visited, so we cannot go back to it.\n9. Sunflower field has already been visited, so we cannot go back to it.\n10. Daisy field has already been visited, so we cannot go back to it.\n11. From the tulip field, we can go to the orchid field (already visited).\n12.
