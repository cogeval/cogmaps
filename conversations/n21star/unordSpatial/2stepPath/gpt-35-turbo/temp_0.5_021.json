The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

Check if the lily field is connected to the aster field. If yes, the shortest path is just \"lily, aster\". If not, continue to the next step.\n3. Create an empty queue and enqueue the lily field.\n4. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n5. Create an empty dictionary to keep track of the previous field for each field.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued field is the aster field, break out of the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each field connected to the dequeued field that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Mark the field as visited.\n     - Add the field to the queue.\n     - Set the previous field for the connected field as the dequeued field in the dictionary.\n7. If the aster field was not found, there is no path from the lily field to the aster field.\n8. If the aster field was found, construct the shortest path by backtracking from the aster field using the previous field dictionary.\n9. Return the shortest path as a comma-separated list of flower names, starting from the lily field.\n\nAnswer: lily, sunflower, aster"
