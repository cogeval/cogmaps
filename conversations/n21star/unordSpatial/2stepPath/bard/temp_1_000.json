The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The rose field offers 50 flowers, the tulip field offers 20 flowers, and the zinnia field offers 20 flowers.\n\nThe rose field is connected to the tulip field, and the tulip field is connected to the daisy field. The daisy field is connected to the zinnia field. Therefore, the shortest path is to visit the rose field, then the tulip field, then the daisy field, and finally the zinnia field.\n\nHowever, the regular expression you provided only matches strings that start with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words, and ending with a word. The words in the list must be all lowercase letters.\n\nSince the word \"rose\" is not all lowercase letters, the regular expression will not match the string \"rose, tulip, daisy, zinnia\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question, following the regular expression you provided, is:\n\n```\nAnswer:\n```\n\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have other questions or requests."
