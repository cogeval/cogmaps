The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's explore these options.\nStep 2: From the marigold field, we can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. However, we can only take one bunch of flowers, so we'll have to choose between the chrysanthemum field and the other fields connected to the marigold field.\nStep 3: Let's compare the number of flowers we can get from each field. From the chrysanthemum field, we can get 10 flowers, but from the other fields connected to the marigold field, we can get a total of 20 flowers (5 from the poppy field, 5 from the zinnia field, 5 from the peony field, and 5 from the daffodil field).\nAnswer: Rose, chrysanthemum, poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, carnation.\nExplanation: The shortest path to get the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is to visit the marigold field, then the chrysanthemum field to get 10 free flowers, and finally the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, and carnation fields to collect a total of 20 flowers. The total number of flowers collected is 30 (10 from the chrysanthemum field + 20 from the other fields).\nNote: Please keep in mind that we can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field, so we'll have to choose wisely based on the available options."
