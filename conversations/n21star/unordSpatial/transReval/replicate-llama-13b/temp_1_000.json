The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Firstly when you enter the rose ground from any of its links you have one free link in your left leading to snapdragon field as well you  find on each links two new 2 ways one of free and another cost associated with it let us examine and list here these flower' fields starting from the left side as you enter the rose field which lead through links to lily, orchid, hydrangea, tulip and lasting on daisy. So therefore based on getting free access the list starts with the ones which offer the highest links first for snapdragon till their links runs to zero, if it terminates early we collect the first set of flower you got with those bunch which  we  will find from the final list then we trace back to the root starting field. Please start tracing, answer each direction as they face right inward, when reaching a point of no free flowers you  indicate stop so i prepare us before continuing. So based on maximum flowers to be gathered at the end  when visiting these snap at your own choices"
