The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the distance to each field and the number of flowers obtained. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections as edges, along with their corresponding distances.\n2. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for the rose field which is set to 0.\n3. Initialize an empty list to keep track of the visited fields.\n4. Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) with the starting field (rose) and its distance (0).\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   b. If the field has not been visited:\n      i. Mark the field as visited.\n      ii. Update the distance to the neighboring fields (connected by edges):\n           - If the total distance to a neighboring field is shorter than its current distance, update it.\n           - Also, update the number of flowers obtained by adding the number of flowers in the current field.\n      iii. Add the neighboring fields to the priority queue with their updated distances.\n6. After all fields have been visited, find the field with the maximum number of flowers obtained.\n7. Trace back the path from the field with the maximum number of flowers to the rose field by following the minimum distance.\n8.
