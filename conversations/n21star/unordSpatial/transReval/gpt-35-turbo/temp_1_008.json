The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will assign a weight to each edge connecting the flower fields, representing the number of flowers obtained by visiting that field. Starting from the rose field, we will calculate the shortest paths to all other fields and choose the one that yields the maximum number of flowers.\n\n1. Initialize a list of distances for all flower fields as infinity, except for the rose field, which is set to 0.\n2. Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the fields to visit, with the rose field as the starting point.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - Update the distances of its neighboring fields if a shorter path is found, and update the priority queue accordingly.\n4. Once all fields have been visited, choose the field with the maximum number of flowers obtained as the final destination.\n5. Trace back the shortest path from the final destination to the rose field by following the field with the minimum distance at each step.\n6. List the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's execute the algorithm step by step to find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. Initialize distances: rose - 0, sunflower - infinity, tulip - infinity, daisy - infinity, orchid - infinity, hydrangea - infinity, lily - infinity, poppy - infinity, zinnia - infinity, peony - infinity, daffodil - infinity, chrysanthemum - infinity, carnation - infinity, iris - infinity, lavender - infinity, aster - infinity, dahlia - infinity, hyacinth - infinity, jasmine - infinity, snapdragon - infinity.\n2. Initialize the priority queue with the rose field as the starting point.\n3. Start with the rose field:\n   - Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: sunflower - 0, tulip - 0, daisy - 0, orchid - 0, hydrangea - 0, lily - 0.\n   - Update the priority queue accordingly: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily.\n4. Choose the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue: sunflower.\n5. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the sunflower field: tulip - 0, daisy - 0, orchid - 0, lily - 0.\n   - Update the priority queue accordingly: tulip, daisy, orchid, lily.\n6. Choose the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue: tulip.\n7. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the tulip field: daisy - 0, orchid - 0, lily - 0.\n   - Update the priority queue accordingly: daisy, orchid, lily.\n8. Choose the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue: daisy.\n9. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the daisy field: orchid - 0, lily - 0.\n   - Update the priority queue accordingly: orchid, lily.\n10. Choose the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue: orchid.\n11. Update the distances of the neighboring fields connected to the orchid field: lily - 0.\n   - Update the priority queue accordingly: lily.\n12. Choose the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue: lily.\n13. No other fields are connected to the lily field, so we have visited all the reachable fields.\n14. The field with the maximum number of flowers obtained is snapdragon (50 flowers).\n15. Trace back the shortest path from snapdragon to the rose field: lily, daisy, tulip, rose.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Daisy, Lily, Snapdragon"
