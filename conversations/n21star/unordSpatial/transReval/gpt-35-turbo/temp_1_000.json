Here is the path that yields the most reward:\n\n24, 9, 41, 35, 23, 22\n\nThe total reward for this path is 20 (10 for visiting room 22 and 10 for visiting room 41). Note that there may be other paths with the same total reward of 20, but this path has the shortest distance. \n\nAnswer: 24, 9, 41, 35, 23, 22"
