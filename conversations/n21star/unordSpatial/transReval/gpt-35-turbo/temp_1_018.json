The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

We will consider each field as a node in a graph, and the connections between fields as edges with weights equal to the number of flowers obtained by visiting the corresponding field.\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 nodes representing each flower field.\n\n2. Assign a weight of 0 to the rose field and infinity to all other fields.\n\n3. Create a priority queue to store the fields to be visited, initially containing only the rose field.\n\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n\n   a. Remove the field with the minimum weight from the priority queue.\n\n   b. For each field connected to the current field, calculate the weight of the connected field as the sum of the weight of the current field and the number of flowers obtained by visiting the connected field.\n\n   c. If the calculated weight is smaller than the current weight of the connected field, update the connected field's weight and add it to the priority queue.\n\n5. After the algorithm finishes, the weights of all fields represent the maximum number of flowers that can be obtained by starting from the rose field.\n\n6. Trace back the shortest path from the rose field to the field with the maximum weight (number of flowers).\n\nThe shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Lily, Sunflower, Snapdragon"
