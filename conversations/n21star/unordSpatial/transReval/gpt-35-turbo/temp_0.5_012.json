The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

However, we need to determine the number of flowers we can get from each field.\n\nStarting from the rose field, we can follow the connections and choose the fields that yield the maximum number of flowers. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. From the rose field, we can go to the hydrangea field, which is connected to the lily field. However, we don't know the number of flowers we can get from these fields.\n\n2. From the rose field, we can also go to the sunflower field, which is connected to the daisy field. Again, we don't know the number of flowers we can get from these fields.\n\n3. From the rose field, we can go to the tulip field, which is connected to the daisy field. We know that from the daisy field, we can get a bunch of flowers, but we don't know the specific type of flower.\n\n4. From the rose field, we can go to the orchid field. However, we don't have any information about the number of flowers we can get from this field.\n\n5. Finally, from the rose field, we can go to the lily field. Again, we don't know the number of flowers we can get from this field.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot determine the specific flower names in order that will yield the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field."
