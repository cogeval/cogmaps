The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Calculate the shortest path to each connected field, keeping track of the number of flowers that can be obtained.\n3. Repeat this process for each field, updating the shortest path and number of flowers if a shorter path is found.\n4. Continue until all fields have been visited.\n5. Finally, output the path with the maximum number of flowers.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields. The number of flowers obtained in the rose field is 0.\n3. Move to the sunflower field. The number of flowers obtained in the sunflower field is 0.\n4. Move to the daisy field. The number of flowers obtained in the daisy field is 0.\n5. Move to the orchid field. The number of flowers obtained in the orchid field is 0.\n6. Move to the hydrangea field. The number of flowers obtained in the hydrangea field is 0.\n7. Move to the lily field. The number of flowers obtained in the lily field is 0.\n8. No more fields to visit. The maximum number of flowers obtained is 0.\nAnswer: Rose"
