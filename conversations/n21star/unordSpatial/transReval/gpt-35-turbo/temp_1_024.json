The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Then, we can choose the field with the maximum number of flowers and continue the process until we reach the desired outcome.\n\nThe rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields. Let's calculate the number of flowers we can get from each of these fields:\n\n- Sunflower field: 0 flowers\n- Tulip field: 0 flowers\n- Daisy field: 0 flowers\n- Orchid field: 0 flowers\n- Hydrangea field: 0 flowers\n- Lily field: 0 flowers\n\nSince we cannot get any flowers from these fields, we need to explore further by looking at the fields connected to them. However, none of these fields yield any additional flowers, so the path ends here. Therefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is simply the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"

The aster field yields 0 flowers.\n- Daisy field is now connected to the aster field, which yields 0 flowers.\n\nSince none of these fields yield any flowers, we continue exploring further:\n\n- Orchid field is now connected to the zinnia field. The zinnia field yields 0 flowers.\n\nSince there are no more fields connected to the orchid field, we have finished exploring the options.\n\nBased on the updated connections, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers remains the same:\n\nAnswer: Rose"
