The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a queue and add the rose field to it.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained from each field.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path taken to reach each field.\n5. Set the number of flowers obtained from the rose field to 0.\n6. Set the path taken to reach the rose field as an empty list.\n7. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a field from the queue.\n   - Check if the field has been visited before. If so, skip the remaining steps for this field.\n   - Add the field to the set of visited fields.\n   - Check if the field is either the snapdragon field or the chrysanthemum field. If so, stop the search and return the path taken to reach this field.\n   - For each connected field of the current field, do the following steps:\n     - If the connected field has not been visited before, enqueue it to the queue.\n     - Update the number of flowers obtained from the connected field by adding the number of flowers obtained from the current field.\n     - Update the path taken to reach the connected field by appending the connected field to the path taken to reach the current field.\n8.
