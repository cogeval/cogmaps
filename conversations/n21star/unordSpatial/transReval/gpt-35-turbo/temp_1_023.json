The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

This algorithm will help us determine the shortest path to each field from the rose field while keeping track of the maximum number of flowers we can obtain along the way.\n\nLet's create a table to track the distance to each field from the rose field and the maximum number of flowers we can obtain at each field:\n\n| Field        | Distance from Rose | Maximum Flowers |\n|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Rose         | 0                 | 0               |\n| Sunflower    | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Tulip        | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Daisy        | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Orchid       | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Hydrangea    | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Lily         | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Poppy        | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Zinnia       | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Peony        | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Daffodil     | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Chrysanthemum| Infinity          | 0               |\n| Jasmine      | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Iris         | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Lavender     | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Aster        | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Dahlia       | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Hyacinth     | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Snapdragon   | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Carnation    | Infinity          | 0               |\n| Marigold     | Infinity          | 0               |\n\nNext, we'll start from the rose field and update the table by following the connections to other fields, calculating the distance and maximum number of flowers at each field:\n\n1. Start at the Rose field with a distance of 0 and no flowers.\n2. Update the distances and maximum flowers for the adjacent fields connected to the Rose field: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily.\n   - Sunflower: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Tulip: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Daisy: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Orchid: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Hydrangea: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Lily: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n3. Update the distances and maximum flowers for the adjacent fields connected to the updated fields (Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily). Continue this process until we reach the Snapdragon field:\n   - Sunflower: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Tulip: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Daisy: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Orchid: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Hydrangea: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Lily: Distance = 1, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Poppy: Distance = 2, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Zinnia: Distance = 2, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Peony: Distance = 3, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Daffodil: Distance = 3, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Chrysanthemum: Distance = 4, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Carnation: Distance = 5, Maximum Flowers = 0\n   - Snapdragon: Distance = 6, Maximum Flowers = 50\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the shortest path from the Rose field to the Snapdragon field is:\nRose -> Daisy -> Zinnia -> Poppy -> Dahlia -> Snapdragon\n\nTherefore, the flower names in order, including Rose, separated by commas, starting from the Rose field and following the shortest path to the Snapdragon field, are:\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Zinnia, Poppy, Dahlia, Snapdragon"
