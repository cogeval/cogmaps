Daisy is connected to the sunflower, tulip, and zinnia fields.\n\nNext, we'll identify the connections of those fields to other fields:\n2. Sunflower is connected to the lily field.\n3. Tulip is connected to the orchid and lily fields.\n4. Zinnia is connected to the peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n\nNow, we check the connections of these fields to see if any of them lead to the dahlia field:\n5. Lily is not connected to the dahlia field.\n6. Orchid is connected to the aster field.\n7. Peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation are not connected to the dahlia field.\n8. Aster is connected to the lavender and snapdragon fields.\n9.
