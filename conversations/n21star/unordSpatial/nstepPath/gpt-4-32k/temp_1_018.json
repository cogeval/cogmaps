From the hydrangea field, possible connections are lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n3. Explore each connected field to see if they connect to the poppy field or connect to other fields:\n   - Lily field connects to sunflower and daisy fields.\n   - Sunflower field connects to the daisy field.\n   - Tulip field connects to daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Daisy field connects to sunflower, zinnia, and lily fields.\n   - Orchid field connects to lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n4. Analyzing the connections above, none of the fields directly connects to the poppy field. So we explore further:\n   - Zinnia field connects to daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n   - Aster field connects to iris, lavender, hyacinth, and snapdragon fields.\n5. Now we have found a connection to the poppy field: the zinnia field connects to the peony field, which connects to the poppy field.\n\nThe shortest path from the hydrangea field to the poppy field is: hydrangea, daisy, zinnia, peony, poppy.\n\nAnswer: Hydrangea, Daisy, Zinnia, Peony, Poppy"
