The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

Let's start by visualizing the connections between the flower fields:\n\n- Aster field is connected to: Dahlia field, Lavender field\n- Dahlia field is connected to: Poppy field, Lavender field\n- Lavender field is connected to: Aster field, Dahlia field\n- Poppy field is connected to: Dahlia field\n- Peony field is connected to: Daffodil field, Carnation field, Poppy field\n- Daffodil field is connected to: Carnation field, Poppy field\n- Carnation field is connected to: Poppy field\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the aster field to the peony field:\n\n1. Start at the aster field.\n2. Check the connections of the aster field: Dahlia field, Lavender field.\n3. Since the peony field is not directly connected to the aster field, we need to explore further.\n4. Move to the lavender field.\n5. Check the connections of the lavender field: Aster field, Dahlia field.\n6. Since the peony field is not directly connected to the lavender field, we need to explore further.\n7. Move to the dahlia field.\n8. Check the connections of the dahlia field: Poppy field, Lavender field.\n9. Since the peony field is not directly connected to the dahlia field, we need to explore further.\n10. Move to the poppy field.\n11. Check the connections of the poppy field: Dahlia field.\n12. Since the peony field is directly connected to the poppy field, we have found the shortest path.\n13. The shortest path from the aster field to the peony field is: Aster, Lavender, Dahlia, Poppy, Peony.\n\nAnswer: Aster, Lavender, Dahlia, Poppy, Peony."
