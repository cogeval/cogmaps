Let's use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\nStarting from the daisy field, we will explore the connected fields in a breadth-first manner until we reach the lavender field.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at the daisy field.\n2. Check the connected fields: tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n3. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n4. Visit the first field in the queue: tulip.\n5. Check the connected fields: daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n6. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n7. Visit the next field in the queue: orchid.\n8. Check the connected fields: lily, sunflower, and aster.\n9. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n10. Visit the next field in the queue: lily.\n11. Check the connected fields: sunflower and daisy.\n12. Add these fields to the BFS queue.\n13. Visit the next field in the queue: sunflower.\n14. Check the connected fields: daisy.\n15. Add this field to the BFS queue.\n16. Visit the next field in the queue: daisy (again).\n17. Check the connected fields: tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n18. Since we have already visited these fields, we skip them.\n19. Visit the next field in the queue: aster.\n20. Check the connected fields: lavender.\n21. We have reached the lavender field.\n\nBased on the BFS traversal, the shortest path from the daisy field to the lavender field is: daisy, sunflower, aster, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Sunflower, Aster, Lavender"
