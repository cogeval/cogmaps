The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.

Starting from the zinnia field, we check its connections: daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n2. Among these connections, we prioritize the fields that are closer to the snapdragon field. Based on the given information, the snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n3. None of the fields directly connected to the zinnia field are the snapdragon field or its immediate neighbors. Therefore, we need to explore further.\n4. Among the connections of the zinnia field, the daffodil field is connected to the poppy field, which is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is directly connected to the lavender field, which is one of the connections of the snapdragon field.\n5. Thus, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the snapdragon field is: zinnia, daffodil, poppy, dahlia, lavender, aster, snapdragon.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, daffodil, poppy, dahlia, lavender, aster, snapdragon."
