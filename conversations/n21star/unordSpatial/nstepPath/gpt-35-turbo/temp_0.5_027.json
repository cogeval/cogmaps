Starting from the zinnia field, we can see that it is connected to the daisy field.\n2. From the daisy field, we can move to the tulip field.\n3. From the tulip field, we can move to the orchid field.\n4. From the orchid field, we can move to the lily field.\n5. From the lily field, we can move to the sunflower field.\n6. From the sunflower field, we can move to the hydrangea field.\n7. From the hydrangea field, we can move to the rose field.\n8. From the rose field, we can move to the iris field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the iris field is: Zinnia, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Hydrangea, Rose, Iris.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Hydrangea, Rose, Iris."
