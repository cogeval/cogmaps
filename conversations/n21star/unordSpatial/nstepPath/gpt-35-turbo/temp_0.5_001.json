Let's start from the rose field and explore the neighboring fields until we reach the dahlia field.\n\nStarting from the rose field, the neighboring fields are: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n\nWe will explore each neighboring field in a breadth-first manner. Let's keep track of the fields we have visited and the path taken to reach each field.\n\n1. From the rose field, we visit the sunflower field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower.\n\n2. From the sunflower field, we visit the daisy field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy.\n\n3. From the daisy field, we visit the orchid field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid.\n\n4. From the orchid field, we visit the lily field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily.\n\n5. From the lily field, we visit the sunflower field (already visited), so we skip it.\n\n6. From the lily field, we visit the hydrangea field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily, hydrangea.\n\n7. From the hydrangea field, we visit the tulip field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily, hydrangea, tulip.\n\n8. From the tulip field, we visit the daisy field (already visited), so we skip it.\n\n9. From the tulip field, we visit the orchid field (already visited), so we skip it.\n\n10. From the tulip field, we visit the lily field (already visited), so we skip it.\n\n11. From the tulip field, we visit the sunflower field (already visited), so we skip it.\n\n12. From the tulip field, we visit the dahlia field. The path becomes: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily, hydrangea, tulip, dahlia.\n\nWe have reached the dahlia field, and the shortest path from the rose field to the dahlia field is: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily, hydrangea, tulip, dahlia.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Hydrangea, Tulip, Dahlia"
