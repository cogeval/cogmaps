We will start from the sunflower field and perform a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue for BFS traversal.\n2. Mark the sunflower field as visited and enqueue it into the queue.\n3. Create a dictionary to keep track of the connected fields for each flower field.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a flower field from the queue.\n   - Check if it is the poppy field. If it is, stop the traversal and go to step 5.\n   - For each connected field of the current flower field, check if it has been visited. If not, mark it as visited, enqueue it into the queue, and update its connected fields in the dictionary.\n5. If the poppy field is found, backtrack the shortest path by following the connected fields recorded in the dictionary.\n6. List the flower names in order, including sunflower, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy"
