Starting from the zinnia field, we know that it is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy, Zinnia -> Peony, Zinnia -> Daffodil, Zinnia -> Chrysanthemum, Zinnia -> Carnation\n\n2. From the daisy field, we can see that it is connected to the tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Orchid, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Lily, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Sunflower\n\n3. From the tulip field, we can see that it is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Lily, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Sunflower\n\n4. From the orchid field, we can see that it is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Sunflower, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Aster\n\n5. From the lily field, we can see that it is connected to the sunflower and daisy fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Daisy\n\n6. From the sunflower field, we can see that it is connected to the daisy field.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy\n\n7. From the daisy field, we can see that it is connected to the tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Orchid\n\n8. From the tulip field, we can see that it is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid\n\n9. From the daisy field, we can see that it is connected to the tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n   - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy -> Orchid\n\n10. From the orchid field, we can see that it is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n    - Possible paths: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy -> Orchid -> Lily, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy -> Orchid -> Sunflower, Zinnia -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Orchid -> Lily -> Sunflower -> Daisy -> Tulip -> Daisy -> Orchid -> Aster\n\n11. From the aster field, we have reached our destination.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the zinnia field to the aster field is:\nZinnia, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Aster\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Aster"
