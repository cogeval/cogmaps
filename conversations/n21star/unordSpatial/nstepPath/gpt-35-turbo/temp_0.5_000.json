Start at the Rose field.\n2. Add Rose to the queue.\n3. Visit the adjacent fields of Rose: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily.\n4. Add these adjacent fields to the queue.\n5. Continue visiting the adjacent fields until we reach the Poppy field.\n\nThe shortest path from the Rose field to the Poppy field is: Rose, Hydrangea, Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Hydrangea, Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy"
