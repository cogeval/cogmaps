Let's list them out:\n\n1. Orchid field (starting point)\n2. Lily field (connected to the orchid field)\n3. Sunflower field (connected to the lily field)\n4. Daisy field (connected to the sunflower field)\n5. Poppy field (connected to the daisy field)\n6. Dahlia field (connected to the poppy field)\n7. Lavender field (connected to the dahlia field)\n8. Aster field (connected to the lavender field)\n9. Peony field (destination)\n\nBy following these connections, we can see that the shortest path from the orchid field to the peony field is:\n\nOrchid, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Peony\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Peony"
