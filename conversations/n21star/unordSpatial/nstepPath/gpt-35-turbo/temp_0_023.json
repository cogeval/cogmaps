The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.

Each flower field will be a node, and the connections between fields will be edges. We can then use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the shortest path.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections:\n   - zinnia -> daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n   - daisy -> zinnia, tulip, orchid, lily, sunflower\n   - peony -> zinnia, daffodil, carnation, poppy\n   - daffodil -> zinnia, peony, carnation, poppy\n   - chrysanthemum -> zinnia, carnation, poppy\n   - carnation -> zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, poppy\n   - poppy -> zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation, dahlia\n   - dahlia -> poppy, lavender\n   - lavender -> dahlia, aster, hyacinth, snapdragon\n   - aster -> lavender, dahlia\n   - hyacinth -> lavender, snapdragon, aster, dahlia\n   - snapdragon -> lavender, hyacinth, aster, dahlia\n   - sunflower -> zinnia, daisy, tulip, lily, orchid, hydrangea\n   - tulip -> zinnia, daisy, orchid, lily, sunflower\n   - orchid -> zinnia, tulip, daisy, lily, sunflower, hydrangea\n   - lily -> zinnia, tulip, daisy, sunflower, orchid, hydrangea\n   - hydrangea -> lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid\n   - rose -> sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily\n   - marigold -> poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n   - iris -> lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n   - jasmine -> iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth\n\n2. Use BFS to find the shortest path from zinnia to lavender:\n   - Start at the zinnia field.\n   - Enqueue zinnia to the queue.\n   - Create an empty visited set.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a flower field from the queue.\n     - If the field is lavender, we have found the shortest path.\n     - Otherwise, add the field to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue all neighboring fields that have not been visited yet.\n   - If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the lavender field, there is no path from zinnia to lavender.\n\n3. The shortest path from zinnia to lavender is: zinnia, poppy, dahlia, lavender.\n\nAnswer: Zinnia, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender"
