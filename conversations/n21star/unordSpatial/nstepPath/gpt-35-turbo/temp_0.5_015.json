Based on the given information, we can construct a graph where each flower field is a node, and the connections between fields are edges.\n\nThe graph representation of the flower fields and their connections is as follows:\n\nOrchid -> Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Aster\nLily -> Sunflower, Daisy\nSunflower -> Daisy\nDaisy -> Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum\nPoppy -> Dahlia\nDahlia -> Lavender\nLavender -> Aster\nAster -> Iris, Hyacinth, Snapdragon\nIris -> Lavender, Aster\nHyacinth -> Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\nSnapdragon -> Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\nZinnia -> Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\nPeony -> Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy\nDaffodil -> Carnation, Poppy\nChrysanthemum -> Carnation, Poppy, Daffodil\nCarnation -> Poppy\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the orchid field, we will explore its neighboring fields, then the neighbors of the neighbors, and so on, until we reach the carnation field.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at the orchid field.\n2. Check its neighbors: Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Aster.\n3. Add the neighbors to a queue for further exploration.\n4. Mark the orchid field as visited.\n5. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue the next field from the queue.\n   b. If the field is the carnation field, stop the search.\n   c. If the field has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue its neighbors (excluding the ones that have already been visited).\n6. The shortest path from the orchid field to the carnation field is the sequence of fields visited during the BFS search.\n\nApplying the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from the orchid field to the carnation field is:\n\nAnswer: Orchid, Aster, Iris, Hyacinth, Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Poppy, Carnation"
