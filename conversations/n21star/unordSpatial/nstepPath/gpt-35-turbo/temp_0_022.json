Take the first connection from the queue (daisy) and check its connections: orchid, lily, sunflower, and aster.\n5. Add these connections to the queue.\n6. Take the next connection from the queue (peony) and check its connections: daffodil, carnation, and poppy.\n7. Add these connections to the queue.\n8.
