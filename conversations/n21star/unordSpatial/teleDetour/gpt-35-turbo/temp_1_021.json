The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Let's begin:\n\n1. Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity except for the rose field, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields based on their distances.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Get the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue (let's call it \"current field\").\n   - For each connected field to the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current field to the connected field (1, as all fields are connected with equal weight).\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the connected field, update the distance and update the previous field.\n     - Add the connected field to the priority queue.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from the rose field to each field. However, we only need to find the shortest path to the fields that yield the maximum number of flowers. The snapdragon field yields 50 flowers, and the chrysanthemum field yields 10 flowers, which is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field to the snapdragon field will yield the maximum number of flowers. Let's calculate that path:\n\n1. From the rose field, we have the following paths:\n   - Rose -> Sunflower (1 flower)\n   - Rose -> Tulip (1 flower)\n   - Rose -> Daisy (1 flower)\n2. From the Sunflower field, we have the following paths:\n   - Sunflower -> Lily (1 flower)\n3. From the Lily field, we have the following paths:\n   - Lily -> Daisy (1 flower)\n4. From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n   - Daisy -> Zinnia (0 flowers)\n5. From the Zinnia field, we have the following paths:\n   - Zinnia -> Daisy (0 flowers)\n6. From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n   - Daisy -> Orchid (0 flowers)\n7. From the Orchid field, we have the following paths:\n   - Orchid -> Sunflower (1 flower)\n8. From the Sunflower field, we have the following paths:\n   - Sunflower -> Daisy (1 flower)\n9. From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n   - Daisy -> Lily (1 flower)\n10. From the Lily field, we have the following paths:\n    - Lily -> Sunflower (1 flower)\n11. From the Sunflower field, we have the following paths:\n    - Sunflower -> Daisy (1 flower)\n12. From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n    - Daisy -> Zinnia (0 flowers)\n13. From the Zinnia field, we have the following paths:\n    - Zinnia -> Daisy (0 flowers)\n14. From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n    - Daisy -> Orchid (0 flowers)\n15. From the Orchid field, we have the following paths:\n    - Orchid -> Aster (0 flowers)\n16. From the Aster field, we have the following paths:\n    - Aster -> Dahlia (0 flowers)\n17. From the Dahlia field, we have the following paths:\n    - Dahlia -> Poppy (0 flowers)\n18. From the Poppy field, we have the following paths:\n    - Poppy -> Dahlia (0 flowers)\n19. From the Dahlia field, we have the following paths:\n    - Dahlia -> Lavender (0 flowers)\n20. From the Lavender field, we have the following paths:\n    - Lavender -> Aster (0 flowers)\n21. From the Aster field, we have the following paths:\n    - Aster -> Snapdragon (50 flowers)\n\nSo, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Sunflower, Lily, Daisy, Zinnia, Daisy, Orchid, Sunflower, Daisy, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, Daisy, Orchid, Aster, Dahlia, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Snapdragon.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Lily, Daisy, Zinnia, Daisy, Orchid, Sunflower, Daisy, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, Daisy, Orchid, Aster, Dahlia, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Snapdragon."

            "content": "Since the path from the orchid field to the aster field is blocked, we need to find an alternative path to maximize the number of flowers starting from the rose field.\n\nConsidering the teleportation portal in the zinnia field, we can immediately go to any other field from there. We still want to reach the snapdragon field, as it yields the maximum number of flowers. Therefore, we will modify the algorithm as follows:\n\n1. Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity except for the rose field, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields based on their distances.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Get the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue (let's call it \"current field\").\n   - For each connected field to the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current field to the connected field (1, as all fields are connected with equal weight).\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the connected field, update the distance and update the previous field.\n     - If the connected field is the snapdragon field, break the loop (we only need to find the shortest path to the snapdragon field).\n     - Add the connected field to the priority queue.\n\nUsing this modified algorithm, let's find the new shortest path from the rose field to the snapdragon field:\n\n1. From the rose field, we have the following paths:\n   - Rose -> Sunflower (1 flower)\n   - Rose -> Tulip (1 flower)\n   - Rose -> Daisy (1 flower)\n2.

From the Daisy field, we have the following paths:\n   - Daisy -> Zinnia (0 flowers)\n5. From the Zinnia field, we can teleport to any field:\n   - Zinnia -> Snapdragon (50 flowers)\n\nTherefore, the new shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Sunflower, Lily, Daisy, Zinnia, Snapdragon.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Lily, Daisy, Zinnia, Snapdragon."
