The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

The shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers will be the one with the highest number of flowers obtained at the end. \n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm step by step to find the shortest path from the rose field. \n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Zinnia, Chrysanthemum"

Considering the presence of the teleportation portal in the zinnia field, we can utilize it to our advantage. \n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to incorporate the teleportation option. \n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity except for the distance from the rose field, which we set to 0. \n\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields to visit, prioritized by the distance from the rose field. \n\n3. Start with the rose field and visit its connected fields in order of distance. For each field, calculate the total number of flowers obtained so far and update the distance if it is shorter than the current distance. \n\n4. If we reach the zinnia field, instead of continuing to its connected fields, we can directly teleport to any other field. Consider each field as a potential destination and calculate the total number of flowers obtained if we teleport to that field. \n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all fields have been visited or the queue is empty. \n\n6. The shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers will be the one with the highest number of flowers obtained at the end. \n\nNow, let's apply this modified algorithm step by step to find the shortest path from the rose field, considering the teleportation option in the zinnia field.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, [Teleportation], Snapdragon, Dahlia, Aster"
