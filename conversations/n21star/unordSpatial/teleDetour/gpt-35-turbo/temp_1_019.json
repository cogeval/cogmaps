Sunflower field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n2. Tulip field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n3. Daisy field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n4. Orchid field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n5. Hydrangea field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n6. Lily field: No additional flowers mentioned, so we skip this field for now.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining fields connected to the above fields:\n\n7.
