The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's map out the connections between the flower fields:\n\n- Rose field is connected to Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily fields.\n- Sunflower field is connected to Daisy field.\n- Tulip field is connected to Daisy, Orchid, Lily, and Sunflower fields.\n- Daisy field is connected to Sunflower field.\n- Orchid field is connected to Lily, Sunflower, and Aster fields.\n- Hydrangea field is connected to Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, and Orchid fields.\n- Lily field is connected to Sunflower and Daisy fields.\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from the Rose field to each flower field, considering only one bunch of flowers from one field. Starting from the Rose field, let's explore the connections:\n\n- Rose -> Sunflower\n- Rose -> Tulip\n- Rose -> Daisy\n- Rose -> Orchid\n- Rose -> Hydrangea\n- Rose -> Lily\n\nOut of these paths, we need to choose the one that yields the maximum number of flowers. To do this, let's consider the number of flowers we can get from each field:\n\n- Sunflower: 0 flowers\n- Tulip: 0 flowers\n- Daisy: 0 flowers\n- Orchid: 0 flowers\n- Hydrangea: 0 flowers\n- Lily: 0 flowers\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of flowers, we should exclude the fields that don't give any flowers. \n\nThe remaining options are: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily. \n\nOut of these, the fields connected to the most flowers are Hydrangea and Lily. Let's choose the path with the most flowers:\n\n- Rose -> Hydrangea -> Lily\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the Rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: Rose, Hydrangea, Lily.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Hydrangea, Lily."
