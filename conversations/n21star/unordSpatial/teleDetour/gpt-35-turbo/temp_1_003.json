The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's analyze the connections and their corresponding flower counts:\n\n- Rose field is connected to the Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily fields. (0 flowers)\n- Sunflower field is connected to the Daisy field. (0 flowers)\n- Daisy field is connected to the Orchid field. (0 flowers)\n- Orchid field is connected to the Lily field. (0 flowers)\n- Lily field is connected to the Sunflower field. (0 flowers)\n\nBased on the given connections, it seems that the Rose field does not have a direct path to any field that yields flowers.\n\nAnswer: No flowers can be obtained starting from the Rose field."

Let's analyze the connections and their corresponding flower counts again:\n\n- Rose field is connected to the Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, and Lily fields. (0 flowers)\n- Sunflower field is connected to the Daisy field. (0 flowers)\n- Daisy field is connected to the Orchid field. (0 flowers)\n- Orchid field is connected to the Lily field. (0 flowers)\n- Lily field is connected to the Sunflower field. (0 flowers)\n\nSince the path from the Orchid field to the Aster field is blocked, we cannot obtain any flowers from these fields.\n\nHowever, with the teleportation portal in the Zinnia field, we can go immediately to any other field. So, to maximize the number of flowers, we should teleport from the Zinnia field to the Snapdragon field and obtain 50 Snapdragon flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, starting from the Rose field, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Zinnia, Snapdragon\n\nAnswer: Rose, Zinnia, Snapdragon."
