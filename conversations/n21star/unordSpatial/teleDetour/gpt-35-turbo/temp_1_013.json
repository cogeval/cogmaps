The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Since we want to maximize the number of flowers, we will choose the field that gives us the highest number of flowers. Let's calculate the number of flowers we can collect from each field:\n\n- Rose field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Sunflower field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Tulip field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Daisy field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Orchid field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Hydrangea field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Lily field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n\nFrom the rose field, none of the connected fields offer any free bunches of flowers. Therefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is just the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose"

Since our goal is to collect the maximum number of flowers, we need to calculate the number of flowers we can collect from each field.\n\nConsidering the connections and free bunches available:\n- Rose field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Sunflower field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Tulip field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Daisy field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Orchid field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Hydrangea field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Lily field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Zinnia field: Teleportation portal available\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining fields and calculate the flowers we can collect from each field:\n- Poppy field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Marigold field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Chrysanthemum field: 10 chrysanthemum flowers (free bunch available)\n- Carnation field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Daffodil field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Peony field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Snapdragon field: 50 snapdragon flowers (free bunch available)\n- Hyacinth field: 0 flowers (no free bunch available)\n- Iris field: 0 flowers (no connection available)\n- Jasmine field: 0 flowers (no connection available)\n- Lavender field: 0 flowers (no connection available)\n- Aster field: 0 flowers (no connection available)\n- Dahlia field: 0 flowers (no connection available)\n\nBased on the above calculations, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is as follows:\n\nRose field, Zinnia field (teleport), Snapdragon field\n\nAnswer: Rose, Zinnia, Snapdragon"
