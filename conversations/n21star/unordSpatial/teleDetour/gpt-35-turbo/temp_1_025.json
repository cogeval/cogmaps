The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

The presence of a teleportation portal in the zinnia field allows us to utilize this to our advantage.\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field, we will modify the Dijkstra's algorithm to include the teleportation option:\n\n1. Initialize the distance of all fields to infinity, except for the rose field, which is set to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields based on their distances.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the field with the smallest distance.\n   - For each neighboring field that is connected to the current field:\n     - Calculate the total distance from the current field to the neighboring field, considering the number of flowers gained.\n     - If the neighboring field is the aster field and the current field is the orchid field, skip this field (as the path is blocked).\n     - If the total distance is smaller than the distance of the neighboring field, update its distance and previous field.\n   - Add the updated neighboring field to the priority queue.\n4.
