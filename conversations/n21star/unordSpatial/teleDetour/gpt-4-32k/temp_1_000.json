However, this will not yield any more reward as there is no connection between room 22 and any other room with a reward. \n2. Teleport to a room that is connected to room 22, giving us a chance to visit more rooms before reaching room 22 to get the reward.\n\nNow, let's evaluate our possible paths:\n\n- Teleport to room 1: \n  Path: 1 -> 21 -> 24 -> 5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 2: \n  Path: 2 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 3: \n  Path: 3 -> 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 4: \n  Path: 4 -> 9 -> 13 -> 21 -> 24 -> 5 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 5: \n  Path: 5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 21 -> 24 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 6:\n  Since there is no connection between room 24 and 6, we cannot choose this option.\n- Teleport to room 7: \n  Path: 7 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 8: \n  Path: 8 -> 12 -> 20 -> 35 -> 41 -> 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 9: \n  Path: 9 -> 13 -> 21 -> 24 -> 5 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 10: \n  Path: 10 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 11: \n  Path: 11 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 12: \n  Path: 12 -> 20 -> 35 -> 41 -> 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 13: \n  Path: 13 -> 21 -> 24 -> 5 -> 9 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 14: \n  Path: 14 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 20: \n  Path: 20 -> 35 -> 41 -> 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 21: \n  Path: 21 -> 24 -> 5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 22:\n  Path: 22 (already in the room with the reward, but no additional rooms visited)\n- Teleport to room 23: \n  Path: 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 35: \n  Path: 35 -> 41 -> 23 -> 22\n- Teleport to room 41: \n  Path: 41 -> 23 -> 22\n\nComparing all the paths, the longest path that yields the most reward by visiting the most rooms before reaching room 22 is: \n\nAnswer: 1, 21, 24, 5, 9, 13, 22"
