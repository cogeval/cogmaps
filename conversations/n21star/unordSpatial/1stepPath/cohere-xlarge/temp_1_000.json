The mini challenge was: In the game Hangman, a word is picked using uniform randomness from a list of words. Then the player guesses letters (A-Z) one by one. Based on whether the guessed letters appear in the word, and where, the number of attempts to guess the word is limited. For example, if the word is \"elephant\", the player first tries \"E\", then \"L\", then \"E\", then \"N\", and so on, until the word is found. The player has six attempts in total. With \"A\" and \"Z\" excluded, there are 25 possible letters, so the chance of getting the word from the single letter stage to the five letter stage is 1/25, or about 4%. From the five letter stage to the six letter stage the chance is 1/25 + 5/25 + 25/25*5/6, or about 29%. With all 26 letters included, the chance becomes 1/26 + 25/26*5/6 + 25/26*5/6*25/26, or about 87%. Write a function that takes a list of words and returns the chance of"
