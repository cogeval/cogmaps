The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

Sunflower field\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from each of these fields to the lily field:\n\n1. Rose field: Rose -> Lily (1 step)\n2. Hydrangea field: Hydrangea -> Lily (1 step)\n3. Tulip field: Tulip -> Lily (1 step)\n4. Zinnia field: Zinnia -> Daisy -> Lily (2 steps)\n5. Sunflower field: Sunflower -> Daisy -> Lily (2 steps)\n\nThe shortest path from the daisy field to the lily field is through the rose, hydrangea, or tulip fields. Therefore, there are three possible shortest paths:\n\nPath 1: Daisy -> Rose -> Lily\nPath 2: Daisy -> Hydrangea -> Lily\nPath 3: Daisy -> Tulip -> Lily\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Rose, Lily, Daisy, Hydrangea, Lily, Daisy, Tulip, Lily"
