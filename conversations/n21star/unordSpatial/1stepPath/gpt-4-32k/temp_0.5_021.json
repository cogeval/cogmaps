Daisy is connected to Sunflower.\n2. Daisy is connected to Tulip.\n3. Daisy is connected to Orchid.\n4. Daisy is connected to Lily.\n5. Daisy is connected to Zinnia.\n\nChecking the connections from these fields:\n\n1. Sunflower is connected to Hydrangea.\n2. Tulip is not connected to Hydrangea.\n3. Orchid is not connected to Hydrangea.\n4. Lily is connected to Hydrangea.\n5. Zinnia is not connected to Hydrangea.\n\nThere are two paths from Daisy to Hydrangea: Daisy -> Sunflower -> Hydrangea, and Daisy -> Lily -> Hydrangea. Both paths have the same number of connections (2), so either one can be considered the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Sunflower, Hydrangea"
