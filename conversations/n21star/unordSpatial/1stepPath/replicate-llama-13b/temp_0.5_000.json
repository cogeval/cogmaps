Please write the code for getting the program running. (No need to finish/test your program).\nYou are the first human on a quest to find the source of energy, so, naturally, you decide to play a game! Your quest is to find out the location of the source of energy by asking questions. This game has 4 players, and each player has a different type of knowledge. The game has one starting question for each player, and each question has three possible answers: positive (true) , negative (false), and unknown (unknown). An unknown question cannot be answered until another question is asked. Player 1 has no knowledge of the source of energy. If player 1 asks an unanswered question, this question is said to be a negative question. Player 2 knows the size and the color of the source of energy, and player 2 has no knowledge of the location of the source of energy. Player 3 knows the location of the source of energy , but he does not know the size or the color of the source of energy. Players are listed in the following sequence: 1234. The rules of the game are: You play the game only once. When you ask a question, you know the answer to your question. And you have to keep track of how many questions each player asked (your questions will always be asked first). You know what was the last question asked. You know your starting questions, and also the last question asked by other players, and whether it was a positive, negative, or an unknown question. You only know whether you asked an unanswered or a negative question. You do not know the answer to any question. If you ask an unanswered question, no players will have any clue as to which question you are asking. 1. Write a program to determine the shortest path from Player 1 to Player 4, if there is one. The shortest path is the one with the smallest number of questions that were asked, no matter whose question it was. 2. Write a program to read a set of questions that are asked by one particular player (i.e., the order of players is irrelevant). For each pair of different questions, whether they are"
