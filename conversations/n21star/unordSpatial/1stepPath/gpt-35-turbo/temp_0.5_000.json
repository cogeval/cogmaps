Create a list of unvisited rooms and set the distance of all rooms to infinity except for room 1, which we set to 0. Set the previous room of all rooms to None.\n2. While there are unvisited rooms:\n   a. Find the unvisited room with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.\n   b. For each neighboring room of the current room that is unvisited:\n      i. Calculate the distance from the start room to the neighboring room through the current room.\n      ii. If this distance is less than the current distance of the neighboring room, update its distance and set its previous room to the current room.\n3. Once we have visited room 24, we can backtrack through the previous rooms to find the shortest path.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 24 is: 1, 5, 24.\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 24"
