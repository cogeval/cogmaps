Starting from the sunflower field, we see that it is connected to the daisy field.\n2. From the daisy field, we can move to the tulip field since they are connected.\n3. From the tulip field, we can move to the orchid field since they are connected.\n4. From the orchid field, we can move to the lily field since they are connected.\n5. Finally, from the lily field, we can move to the rose field since they are connected.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the rose field is: Sunflower, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Rose.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Tulip, Orchid, Lily, Rose"
