The queue is empty, and we have not reached the rose field yet.\n32. Repeat steps 4-31 until the rose field is reached.\n\nBased on the given connections, there is no direct path from the sunflower field to the rose field. Therefore, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the rose field does not exist.\n\nAnswer: No path exists from the sunflower field to the rose field."
