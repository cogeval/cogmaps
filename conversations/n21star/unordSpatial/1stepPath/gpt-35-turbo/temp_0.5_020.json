Each flower field can be considered as a node, and the connections between fields represent edges. We will apply the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\n1. Start at the daisy field.\n2. Check the connections of the daisy field: sunflower, tulip, lily.\n3. Add the sunflower and tulip fields to the queue.\n4. Move to the sunflower field.\n5. Check the connections of the sunflower field: daisy, orchid, lily, tulip.\n6. Skip the daisy field since we have already visited it.\n7. Add the orchid, lily, and tulip fields to the queue.\n8. Move to the tulip field.\n9. The tulip field is the target field, so we can stop here.\n\nThe shortest path from the daisy field to the tulip field is: daisy, tulip.\n\nAnswer: Daisy, Tulip"
