The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Here are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start from the rose field.\n2. Initialize an empty queue and add the rose field to it.\n3. Initialize an empty visited set to keep track of visited fields.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained from each field.\n5. Initialize a dictionary to store the path taken to reach each field.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue the first field from the queue.\n   b. If the field has not been visited, mark it as visited.\n   c. For each neighboring field of the current field, do the following:\n      - If the neighboring field has not been visited, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n      - Calculate the total number of flowers obtained by adding the flowers from the current field and the flowers obtained from visiting this neighboring field.\n      - If the total number of flowers obtained is greater than the previous maximum number of flowers obtained for this neighboring field, update the maximum number of flowers obtained and the path taken to reach this neighboring field.\n7. Return the path taken to reach the field with the maximum number of flowers obtained from the rose field.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Zinnia, Peony, Poppy, Dahlia, Snapdragon"
