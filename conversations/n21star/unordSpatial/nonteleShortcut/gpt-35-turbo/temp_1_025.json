The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the rose field, we can go to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, or lily fields.\n2. From the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field.\n3. From the daisy field, we can go to the zinnia field.\n4. From the zinnia field, we can go to the daffodil field.\n5. From the daffodil field, we can go to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nAt this point, we have reached the chrysanthemum field, where we can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. This is the maximum number of flowers we can obtain on this path.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum."
