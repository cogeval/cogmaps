The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a priority queue and initialize it with the rose field as the only element, with a distance of 0.\n3. Create a distance array and initialize all distances to infinity, except for the rose field which is set to 0.\n4. Create a visited array and initialize all elements to false.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - Mark the field as visited.\n   - For each neighboring field that is connected to the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance to the neighboring field by adding the number of flowers obtained from the current field to the distance of the current field.\n     - If the calculated distance is less than the distance of the neighboring field, update the distance and add the neighboring field to the priority queue.\n6. Once the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the rose field to all other fields.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Initialize the priority queue with the rose field and the distance array with the distance to the rose field as 0.\n3. Initialize the visited array with all elements as false.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue, which is the rose field.\n   - Mark the rose field as visited.\n   - Check the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n   - Calculate the distance to each neighboring field by adding the number of flowers obtained from the rose field to the distance of the rose field.\n   - Update the distance array with the calculated distances.\n   - Add the neighboring fields to the priority queue.\n   - Repeat this process until all fields have been visited.\n5. Once the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distances from the rose field to all other fields.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the rose field to the field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\n1. The distance array after applying Dijkstra's algorithm is as follows:\n   - Rose: 0\n   - Sunflower: 1\n   - Tulip: 1\n   - Daisy: 1\n   - Orchid: 1\n   - Hydrangea: 1\n   - Lily: 1\n   - Marigold: Infinity\n   - Poppy: Infinity\n   - Zinnia: Infinity\n   - Peony: Infinity\n   - Daffodil: Infinity\n   - Chrysanthemum: Infinity\n   - Iris: Infinity\n   - Lavender: Infinity\n   - Aster: Infinity\n   - Dahlia: Infinity\n   - Hyacinth: Infinity\n   - Jasmine: Infinity\n   - Snapdragon: Infinity\n   - Carnation: Infinity\n\n2.
