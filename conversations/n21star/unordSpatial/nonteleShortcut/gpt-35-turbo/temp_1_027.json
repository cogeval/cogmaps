The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Initialize the distance array for all fields with infinity, except for the rose field which is set to 0. \n2. Create a priority queue to store the fields and their corresponding distances. Insert the rose field with distance 0 into the priority queue. \n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps: \n    a. Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue. \n    b. For each neighboring field connected to the current field, calculate the distance to reach it. If this distance is shorter than the current distance stored in the distance array, update the distance array and insert the neighboring field with its new distance into the priority queue. \n4. Once the algorithm has finished, the distance array will contain the shortest distance from the rose field to all other fields. \n5. Starting from the rose field, follow the shortest path by selecting the neighboring field with the highest number of flowers. Repeat this step until you reach a field with no connected fields. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is: rose, sunflower, daisy, poppy, chrysanthemum, carnation.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Poppy, Chrysanthemum, Carnation."
