The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

It's a long passage, so it's easy to get confused. There are a few ways to go about solving it, but I'll just show one way.\n\nIt's important to know that you're trying to find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers. In other words, you're trying to find the shortest path that goes through every flower field.\n\nThe first thing to do is to make a list of all the flowers. The flowers are orchid, daisy, sunflower, tulip, hydrangea, lily, rose, daffodil, zinnia, jasmine, snapdragon, marigold, lily, daffodil, carnation, hyacinth, lavender, aster, and chrysanthemum.\n\nYou can find the shortest path by using the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+'.
