The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From your instruction i realized that only have the option to take once bunch o  flowers. Since, we also  can' got the hybrid one of lily iris hybrid that' you gave us, then i start will begin of step one rose and from every fields have direct to flower as following list are for one bunch from every.\n1-Daisy, from poppy we start getting five, yes only ten. It yield. poppy x two that also means we gonna also go through chrysanthemum x five, because through there is jazymn direct, from which you pick only, three yeah ten also x two then gonna connect on our way, carnanatihon at peony ten then end at ten then end of. Okay i think i remember i started the one, peonies yeah one bunch of ten but they yield four. Oh at that end. The answer yes it was from direct and chrosanthemu and i hope your journey from dairy also the bunch from lili\nSteps\nAnswer:: Rose, Peony, ( Chrysanthenum, Poppy, Dahlia)."
