The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Each flower field will be represented as a node, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's represent the connections between fields:\n\n- The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n- The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field.\n- The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n- The daisy field is connected to the sunflower field.\n- The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n- The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n- The lily field is connected to the sunflower and daisy fields.\n- The aster field is connected to the lavender and dahlia fields.\n- The lavender field is connected to the aster field.\n- The dahlia field is connected to the poppy, lavender, and aster fields.\n- The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field.\n- The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields.\n- The carnation field is connected to the poppy field.\n- The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.\n- The daffodil field is connected to the carnation and poppy fields.\n- The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n- The jasmine field is connected to the iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.\n- The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields.\n- The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n- The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n- The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from the rose field to maximize the number of flowers. We will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Add the rose field to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   4. Dequeue a field from the front of the queue.\n   5. If the dequeued field is a snapdragon field or a chrysanthemum field, stop the BFS and return the path.\n   6. Otherwise, enqueue all connected fields that have not been visited yet and update their paths.\n7. If no snapdragon or chrysanthemum fields were found, return an empty path.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's apply the BFS algorithm:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Hydrangea, Dahlia, Snapdragon"
