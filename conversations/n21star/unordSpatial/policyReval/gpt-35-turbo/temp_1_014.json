The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's examine each connection and choose the field that provides the maximum number of flowers.\n\n1. Rose field connects to Sunflower field. No free flowers available in the sunflower field.\n2. Rose field connects to Tulip field. No free flowers available in the tulip field.\n3. Rose field connects to Daisy field. No free flowers available in the daisy field.\n4. Rose field connects to Orchid field. No free flowers available in the orchid field.\n5. Rose field connects to Hydrangea field. No free flowers available in the hydrangea field.\n6. Rose field connects to Lily field. No free flowers available in the lily field.\n\nBased on the given connections, none of the fields connected to the rose field offer any free flowers. Therefore, starting from the rose field, we cannot collect any additional flowers apart from the roses themselves.\n\nAnswer: Rose."
