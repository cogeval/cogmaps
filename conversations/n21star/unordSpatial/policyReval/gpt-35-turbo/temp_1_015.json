The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will start from the rose field and calculate the shortest distance to each connected field, considering the number of flowers we can collect in each field. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a list of all the fields and initialize their distances as infinity, except for the rose field which will have a distance of 0. Also, create a list to keep track of the path taken from the rose field to each field.\n\n2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store fields based on their distances. Insert the rose field into the priority queue.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the field with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor connected to the current field:\n     - Calculate the distance from the current field to the neighbor, taking into account the number of flowers available in the neighbor field.\n     - If this distance is less than the neighbor's current distance:\n       - Update the neighbor's distance.\n       - Update the path from the rose field to the neighbor.\n       - Insert the neighbor into the priority queue.\n\n4. After processing all the fields, we will have the shortest distance and path from the rose field to each field.\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, we can start from the rose field and follow the path with the highest number of flowers at each step. Here is the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Hydrangea, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy"
