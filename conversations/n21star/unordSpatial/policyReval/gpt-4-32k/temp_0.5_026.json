The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Check the connected fields: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n3. From the connected fields, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Orchid field connects to the aster field.\n   - Hydrangea field connects to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n4. From the orchid and hydrangea fields, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Orchid field connects to the aster field.\n   - Hydrangea field connects to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n5. From the aster field, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Aster field connects to the snapdragon field.\n6.

From the snapdragon field, find the ones that lead to the marigold field:\n    - Snapdragon field connects to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n13. No direct connection from these fields to the marigold field.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path to the snapdragon field again, as it offers the second-highest number of flowers:\n\n1. Start at the rose field.\n2. Check the connected fields: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n3. From the connected fields, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Orchid field connects to the aster field.\n   - Hydrangea field connects to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n4. From the orchid and hydrangea fields, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Orchid field connects to the aster field.\n   - Hydrangea field connects to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n5. From the aster field, find the ones that lead to the snapdragon field:\n   - Aster field connects to the snapdragon field.\n6. The shortest path to the snapdragon field is: rose, orchid, aster, snapdragon.\n\nSince we couldn't find a shorter path to the marigold field with 100 flowers, the shortest path to get the maximum number of flowers is still the path to the snapdragon field with 50 flowers.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Aster, Snapdragon"
