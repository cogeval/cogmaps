The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be represented as a node, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nStep 1: Create a graph representation of the fields and their connections.\n\n- Rose field: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\n- Marigold field: Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n- Iris field: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\n- Hydrangea field: Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid\n- Tulip field: Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower\n- Zinnia field: Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n- Chrysanthemum field: Carnation, Poppy, Peony, Daffodil\n- Jasmine field: Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth\n- Orchid field: Lily, Sunflower, Aster\n- Peony field: Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy\n- Daffodil field: Carnation, Poppy\n- Hyacinth field: Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n- Lily field: Sunflower, Daisy\n- Carnation field: Poppy\n- Snapdragon field: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n- Sunflower field: Daisy\n- Poppy field: Dahlia\n- Dahlia field: Lavender\n- Lavender field: Aster\n\nStep 2: Identify the clusters using depth-first search (DFS).\n\n- Start with an empty list of clusters.\n- For each field:\n  - If the field is not already in any cluster, create a new cluster.\n  - Perform a DFS starting from the field, adding all connected fields to the cluster.\n  - Mark each added field as visited.\n- The number of clusters is the length of the list of clusters.\n\nStep 3: Perform the DFS and count the clusters.\n\n- Start with an empty list of clusters.\n- For each field:\n  - If the field is not already in any cluster, create a new cluster.\n  - Perform a DFS starting from the field, adding all connected fields to the cluster.\n  - Mark each added field as visited.\n- The number of clusters is the length of the list of clusters.\n\nBased on the given information, we can identify the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\nCluster 2: Marigold, Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\nCluster 3: Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
