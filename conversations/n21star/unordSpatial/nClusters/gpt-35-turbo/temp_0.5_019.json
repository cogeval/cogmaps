The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each flower field can be considered as a node in the graph, and the connections between the fields represent the edges.\n\nLet's start by identifying the clusters. We will iterate through each field and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the fields connected to it. If we encounter a field that has already been visited, we will skip it to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a set to keep track of visited fields.\n2. Initialize a variable to count the number of clusters.\n3. Iterate through each field in the flower county.\n4. If the field has not been visited, start a DFS from that field.\n5. In the DFS function, mark the current field as visited and add it to the current cluster.\n6. Iterate through the connections of the current field.\n7. If a connected field has not been visited, recursively call the DFS function on that field.\n8. After the DFS function completes, increment the cluster count by 1.\n9. Repeat steps 4-8 for any remaining unvisited fields.\n10. The final count of clusters is the answer.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm."
