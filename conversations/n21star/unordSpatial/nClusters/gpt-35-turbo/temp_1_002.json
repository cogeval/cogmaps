The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field will be considered as a node, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's create an adjacency list to represent the connections between fields:\n\n- rose: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily\n- sunflower: rose, tulip, daisy, hydrangea, lily\n- tulip: rose, sunflower, daisy, orchid, lily\n- daisy: rose, sunflower, tulip, hydrangea\n- orchid: rose, hydrangea, tulip, lily, sunflower\n- hydrangea: rose, orchid, lily, sunflower, tulip\n- lily: rose, sunflower, hydrangea, orchid, tulip\n- marigold: poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n- poppy: marigold, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n- zinnia: marigold, poppy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n- peony: marigold, poppy, zinnia, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n- daffodil: marigold, poppy, peony, chrysanthemum, carnation\n- chrysanthemum: marigold, poppy, peony, daffodil, carnation\n- iris: lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n- lavender: iris, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n- aster: iris, lavender, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n- dahlia: iris, lavender, aster, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon, poppy\n- hyacinth: iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, jasmine, snapdragon\n- jasmine: iris, lavender, aster, hyacinth, dahlia, snapdragon\n- snapdragon: iris, lavender, aster, hyacinth, dahlia, jasmine\n- orchid: sunflower, tulip, daisy, lily\n- carnation: marigold, poppy, chrysanthemum, daffodil\n- peony: marigold, poppy, daffodil\n- daffodil: marigold, poppy, chrysanthemum, peony\n- lily: rose, hydrangea, orchid, sunflower\n- poppy: marigold, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, dahlia\n- dahlia: poppy, lavender, aster, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n\nBased on the adjacency list, we can start with the first field and perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find all the fields that are connected to it. After visiting all the fields in the connected component, we mark them as visited and move on to the next unvisited field.\n\nPerforming this algorithm for all the fields in the county will give us the number of densely-connected field clusters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of clusters using BFS:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited fields and a variable to count the clusters.\n2. For each unvisited field:\n   - Perform BFS starting from that field.\n   - Add all the visited fields to the set of visited fields.\n   - Increment the cluster count by 1.\n3. The final cluster count will be the answer.\n\nUsing this approach, let's calculate the number of densely-connected field clusters in the county."
