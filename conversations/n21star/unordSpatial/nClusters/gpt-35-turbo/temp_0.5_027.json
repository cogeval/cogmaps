Start with the rose field and follow the connections: rose -> sunflower -> tulip -> daisy -> orchid -> hydrangea -> lily -> sunflower -> tulip -> daisy -> orchid -> hydrangea -> lily. This forms a densely-connected cluster.\n\n2. Move to the marigold field and follow the connections: marigold -> poppy -> zinnia -> daisy -> peony -> daffodil -> chrysanthemum -> carnation -> poppy -> zinnia -> daisy -> peony -> daffodil -> chrysanthemum -> carnation. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Continue with the iris field and follow the connections: iris -> lavender -> aster -> dahlia -> hyacinth -> jasmine -> iris. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n4. Proceed to the hydrangea field and follow the connections: hydrangea -> lily -> sunflower -> tulip -> daisy -> orchid -> hydrangea. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n5. Move to the tulip field and follow the connections: tulip -> daisy -> orchid -> lily -> sunflower -> tulip. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n6. Continue with the zinnia field and follow the connections: zinnia -> daisy -> peony -> daffodil -> chrysanthemum -> carnation -> poppy -> zinnia. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n7. Proceed to the chrysanthemum field and follow the connections: chrysanthemum -> carnation -> poppy -> peony -> daffodil -> chrysanthemum. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n8. Move to the jasmine field and follow the connections: jasmine -> iris -> lavender -> aster -> dahlia -> hyacinth -> jasmine. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n9. Proceed to the orchid field and follow the connections: orchid -> lily -> sunflower -> aster -> orchid. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n10. Move to the peony field and follow the connections: peony -> daffodil -> carnation -> poppy -> peony. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n11. Proceed to the daffodil field and follow the connections: daffodil -> carnation -> poppy -> daffodil. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n12. Move to the hyacinth field and follow the connections: hyacinth -> snapdragon -> lavender -> aster -> dahlia -> hyacinth. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n13. Proceed to the lily field and follow the connections: lily -> sunflower -> daisy -> lily. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n14. Move to the carnation field and follow the connections: carnation -> poppy -> carnation. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n15. Proceed to the snapdragon field and follow the connections: snapdragon -> lavender -> aster -> dahlia -> snapdragon. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n16. Move to the sunflower field and follow the connections: sunflower -> daisy -> sunflower. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n17. Proceed to the poppy field and follow the connections: poppy -> dahlia -> poppy. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n18. Move to the dahlia field and follow the connections: dahlia -> lavender -> aster -> dahlia. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n19.
