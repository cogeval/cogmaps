The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

We can represent each field as a node and the connections between fields as edges. \n\nStep 1: Create an adjacency list to represent the connections between fields.\n\n- The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n- The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n- The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields.\n- The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n- The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n- The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n- The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields.\n- The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.\n- The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n- The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.\n- The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields.\n- The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n- The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields.\n- The carnation field is connected to the poppy field.\n- The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n- The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field.\n- The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field.\n- The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field.\n- The lavender field is connected to the aster field.\n\nBased on the above information, we can create the following adjacency list:\n\nrose: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily\nmarigold: poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\niris: lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\nhydrangea: lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid\ntulip: daisy, orchid, lily, sunflower\nzinnia: daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\nchrysanthemum: carnation, poppy, peony, daffodil\njasmine: iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth\norchid: lily, sunflower, aster\npeony: daffodil, carnation, poppy\ndaffodil: carnation, poppy\nhyacinth: snapdragon, lavender, aster, dahlia\nlily: sunflower, daisy\ncarnation: poppy\nsnapdragon: lavender, aster, dahlia\nsunflower: daisy\npoppy: dahlia\ndahlia: lavender\nlavender: aster\naster: \n\nStep 2: Traverse the graph to find the clusters.\n\nWe can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find the clusters. Starting from each unvisited field, we can perform a DFS to explore all the connected fields and mark them as visited. Each DFS traversal will represent one cluster.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of clusters.\n\nBy performing the DFS traversal for each unvisited field, we can count the number of clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 12 clusters"
