The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

Each field can be represented as a node, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nLet's create a graph to visualize the connections between fields:\n\n- Rose field: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\n- Marigold field: Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n- Iris field: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\n- Hydrangea field: Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid\n- Tulip field: Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower\n- Zinnia field: Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n- Chrysanthemum field: Carnation, Poppy, Peony, Daffodil\n- Jasmine field: Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth\n- Orchid field: Lily, Sunflower, Aster\n- Peony field: Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy\n- Daffodil field: Carnation, Poppy\n- Hyacinth field: Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n- Lily field: Sunflower, Daisy\n- Carnation field: Poppy\n- Snapdragon field: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n- Sunflower field: Daisy\n- Poppy field: Dahlia\n- Dahlia field: Lavender\n- Lavender field: Aster\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected field clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph:\n\n1. Start with the Rose field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily.\n2. Start with the Marigold field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation.\n3. Start with the Iris field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Snapdragon, Jasmine.\n4. Start with the Hydrangea field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid.\n5. Start with the Tulip field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower.\n6. Start with the Zinnia field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation.\n7. Start with the Chrysanthemum field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Carnation, Poppy, Peony, Daffodil.\n8. Start with the Jasmine field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Snapdragon.\n9. Start with the Orchid field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lily, Sunflower, Aster.\n10. Start with the Peony field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy.\n11. Start with the Daffodil field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Carnation, Poppy.\n12. Start with the Hyacinth field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia.\n13. Start with the Lily field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Sunflower, Daisy.\n14. Start with the Carnation field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Poppy.\n15. Start with the Snapdragon field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia.\n16. Start with the Sunflower field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Daisy.\n17. Start with the Poppy field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Dahlia.\n18. Start with the Dahlia field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Lavender.\n19. Start with the Lavender field and perform a DFS to explore all connected fields: Aster.\n\nAfter performing the DFS for each field, we can count the number of clusters that have a minimum of 2 fields.\n\nAnswer: there are 19 clusters."
