The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field will be represented as a node, and the connections between fields will be represented as edges.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the flower county, where each field is a node and the connections between fields are edges.\n\n2. Initialize a counter variable to 0 to keep track of the number of densely-connected clusters.\n\n3. Initialize a set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n\n4. For each node in the graph:\n   a. If the node has not been visited:\n      i. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all the nodes connected to the current node.\n      ii. Increment the counter variable by 1.\n      iii. Mark all visited nodes as visited in the set.\n\n5. The final value of the counter variable will be the number of densely-connected field clusters in the flower county.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
