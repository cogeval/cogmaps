Starting with the rose field, we find the following connected fields: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n2. Moving on to the marigold field, we find the following connected fields: poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation.\n3. Next, the iris field is connected to lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon.\n4. The hydrangea field is connected to lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid.\n5. The tulip field is connected to daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n6. The zinnia field is connected to daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation.\n7. The chrysanthemum field is connected to carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil.\n8. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth.\n9. The orchid field is connected to lily, sunflower, and aster.\n10. The peony field is connected to daffodil, carnation, and poppy.\n11. The daffodil field is connected to carnation and poppy.\n12. The hyacinth field is connected to snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia.\n13. The lily field is connected to sunflower and daisy.\n14. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field.\n15. The snapdragon field is connected to lavender, aster, and dahlia.\n16. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field.\n17. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field.\n18. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field.\n19. The lavender field is connected to the aster field.\n\nBased on the connections, we have identified 19 clusters of densely-connected fields.\n\nAnswer: there are 19 clusters."
