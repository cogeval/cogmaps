The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Each field can be considered as a node, and the connections between fields can be represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a list of all the fields and their connections:\n\n1. Rose: Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\n2. Sunflower: Daisy\n3. Tulip: Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower\n4. Daisy: Sunflower\n5. Orchid: Lily, Sunflower\n6. Hydrangea: Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid\n7. Lily: Sunflower\n8. Marigold: Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n9. Poppy: Dahlia\n10. Zinnia: Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\n11. Peony: Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy\n12. Daffodil: Carnation, Poppy\n13. Chrysanthemum: Carnation, Poppy, Peony\n14. Iris: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\n15. Lavender: Aster\n16. Aster: Dahlia\n17. Dahlia: Lavender\n18. Hyacinth: Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n19. Jasmine: Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth\n20. Snapdragon: Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\n21. Carnation: Poppy\n\nNow, let's identify the clusters by traversing the graph. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore each cluster:\n\n1. Start with an empty list to store the clusters.\n2. For each field that has not been visited yet, perform a DFS to explore the connected fields.\n3. During the DFS, mark each visited field as visited to avoid revisiting it.\n4. Once the DFS is complete, add the visited fields to the cluster list.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all fields have been visited.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm and count the number of clusters."
