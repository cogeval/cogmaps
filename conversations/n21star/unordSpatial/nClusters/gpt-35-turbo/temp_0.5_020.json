The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

We will create a graph where each field is represented as a node, and the connections between fields are represented as edges.\n\nStep 1: Create a graph representation of the flower county:\n- Create a node for each field: rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily, marigold, poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation, iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon.\n- Add edges between the connected fields based on the given information.\n\nStep 2: Identify the densely-connected field clusters:\n- Use a graph traversal algorithm (such as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) to explore the graph and identify clusters of fields that are densely connected.\n- Start from each unvisited field and perform a traversal to find all connected fields.\n- Count the number of clusters where the size of the cluster is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of densely-connected field clusters:\n- Count the number of clusters identified in step 2.\n\nAnswer: there are X clusters (where X is the number of clusters identified)."
