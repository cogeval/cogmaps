If a connected room is not already visited, we mark it as visited and explore all its connected rooms. We repeat this process until all rooms are visited. Each time we start exploring a new room, we increment the cluster count by 1. \n\nUsing this algorithm, we can identify the following densely-connected clusters in the house:\n- Cluster 1: Rooms 1, 4, 5, 9, 13, 21, and 24\n- Cluster 2: Rooms 2, 6, 7, 10, and 11\n- Cluster 3: Room 22\n- Cluster 4: Rooms 3, 8, 12, 20, 23, and 35\n- Cluster 5: Room 14\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
