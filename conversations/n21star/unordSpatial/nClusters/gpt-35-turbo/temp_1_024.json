The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

Then, I will use a graph traversal algorithm to identify the clusters.\n\nStep 1: Create a graph representation of the connections between the fields.\n- Each field will be represented as a node in the graph.\n- The connections between fields will be represented as edges in the graph.\n\nBased on the given connections, the graph can be represented as follows:\n\nRose -> Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\nMarigold -> Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\nIris -> Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\nHydrangea -> Lily, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid\nTulip -> Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower\nZinnia -> Daisy, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\nChrysanthemum -> Carnation, Poppy, Peony, Daffodil\nJasmine -> Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth\nOrchid -> Lily, Sunflower, Aster\nPeony -> Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy\nDaffodil -> Carnation, Poppy\nHyacinth -> Snapdragon, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\nLily -> Sunflower, Daisy\nCarnation -> Poppy\nSnapdragon -> Lavender, Aster, Dahlia\nSunflower -> Daisy\nPoppy -> Dahlia\nDahlia -> Lavender\nLavender -> Aster\n\nStep 2: Use a graph traversal algorithm to identify the clusters.\n- We can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the graph and identify the clusters.\n\nStarting with the first field (Rose) as the source, we can perform a DFS to traverse the graph and identify the clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Hydrangea, Lily\nCluster 2: Marigold, Poppy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Chrysanthemum, Carnation\nCluster 3: Iris, Lavender, Aster, Dahlia, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Snapdragon\n\nStep 3: Count the number of clusters identified.\n- In this case, we have identified 3 densely-connected field clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
