The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. How many densely-connected field clusters do we have in this county? A densely-connected cluster is a group of fields that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 fields."

First, let's represent the given information in the form of a graph, where each field is a node, and the connections between fields are represented by edges.\n2. We'll create a graph with 21 nodes representing the 21 flower fields. We'll add edges between the connected fields based on the given information.\n3. Next, we'll perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the graph to identify the connected clusters.\n4. During the DFS traversal, each time we visit a node, we'll mark it as visited and recursively explore its neighboring nodes.\n5. Whenever we encounter a node that has already been visited, it means that we have found a densely-connected cluster.\n6. After traversing the entire graph, we'll count the number of clusters we have found.\n\nLet's perform these steps to find the answer."
