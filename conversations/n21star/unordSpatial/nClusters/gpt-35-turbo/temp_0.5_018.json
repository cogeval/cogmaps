The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

Rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily\n2. Marigold, poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, carnation\n3. Iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these clusters are connected to each other. \n\nWe can see that the hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. Since the sunflower field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nSimilarly, the tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields. Since the sunflower field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. Since the sunflower field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. Since the daisy field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. Since the poppy field is already part of the second cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe jasmine field is connected to the iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. Since the lavender field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. Since the poppy field is already part of the second cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe daffodil field is connected to the carnation and poppy fields. Since the poppy field is already part of the second cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. Since the lavender field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe lily field is connected to the sunflower and daisy fields. Since the sunflower field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe carnation field is connected to the poppy field. Since the poppy field is already part of the second cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. Since the lavender field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. Since the daisy field is already part of the first cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. Since the dahlia field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. Since the lavender field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nThe lavender field is connected to the aster field. Since the aster field is already part of the third cluster, we don't count it as a separate cluster. \n\nAfter considering all the connections, we have identified 3 densely-connected field clusters in this county. \n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
