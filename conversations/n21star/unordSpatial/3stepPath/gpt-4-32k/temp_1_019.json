Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Start at the sunflower field.\n2. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field and the rose field.\n3. From the daisy field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n4. From the rose field, there is no direct connection to the iris field. However, the rose field is connected to the hydrangea, tulip, orchid, and lily fields.\n5. From the hydrangea field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n6. From the tulip field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n7. From the orchid field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n8. From the lily field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n9. The rose field is also connected to the lily and sunflower fields. Since we have already explored the sunflower field and found no connection, let's try the lily field.\n10. From the lily field, there is no direct connection to the iris field.\n11. From the hydrangea, tulip, orchid, and lily fields, there is no direct connection to the iris field. But from the orchid field, there is a connection to the aster field.\n12. From the aster field, there is a direct connection to the iris field.\n\nSo, the shortest path from the sunflower field to the iris field is:\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Rose, Orchid, Aster, Iris"
