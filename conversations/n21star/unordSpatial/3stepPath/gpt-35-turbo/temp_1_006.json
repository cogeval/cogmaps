The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.

Starting from the rose field, we will explore all possible paths until we reach the hyacinth field.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue and enqueue the starting node, which is the rose field.\n2. Create an empty list to store the visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent of each node.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - Check if the node is the hyacinth field. If it is, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n   - If the node has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to the visited list.\n   - Enqueue all the neighboring fields of the current node that have not been visited yet.\n   - For each neighboring field, set the parent as the current node in the parent dictionary.\n5. If we reach this point, it means there is no path from the rose field to the hyacinth field.\n\nNow let's apply the algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Enqueue the rose field.\n2. Visited: [rose]\n3. Parent: {rose: None}\n4. Enqueue the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n5. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n6. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n7. Enqueue the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n8. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n9. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n10. Enqueue the hydrangea, lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n11. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n12. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n13. Enqueue the hydrangea, lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n14. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n15. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n16. Enqueue the hydrangea, lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n17. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n18. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n19. Enqueue the hydrangea, lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n20. Visited: [rose, sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, lily]\n21. Parent: {rose: None, sunflower: rose, tulip: rose, daisy: rose, orchid: rose, hydrangea: rose, lily: rose}\n\nSince we have not found the hyacinth field, there is no path from the rose field to the hyacinth field.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from the rose field to the hyacinth field."
