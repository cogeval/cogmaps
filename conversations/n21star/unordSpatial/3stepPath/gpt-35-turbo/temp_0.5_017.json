The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.

Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a graph with the flower fields as nodes and the connections as edges.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge since all connections have the same weight.\n3. Use a shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path from the sunflower field to the jasmine field.\n\nNow let's go through the steps and find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a graph with the following connections:\n   - sunflower -> daisy, lily\n   - daisy -> sunflower, tulip, orchid, zinnia, lily\n   - lily -> sunflower, daisy\n   - tulip -> daisy, orchid, lily\n   - orchid -> sunflower, tulip, lily\n   - zinnia -> daisy\n   - peony -> zinnia, daffodil, carnation\n   - daffodil -> peony, carnation\n   - chrysanthemum -> peony, daffodil, carnation\n   - carnation -> peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum\n   - poppy -> zinnia, chrysanthemum, daffodil\n   - iris -> lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, snapdragon\n   - lavender -> iris, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, snapdragon\n   - aster -> iris, lavender, dahlia, hyacinth, snapdragon\n   - dahlia -> iris, lavender, aster, hyacinth, poppy\n   - hyacinth -> iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, snapdragon\n   - jasmine -> iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth\n\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge.\n\n3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the sunflower field to the jasmine field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Daisy, Iris, Jasmine"
