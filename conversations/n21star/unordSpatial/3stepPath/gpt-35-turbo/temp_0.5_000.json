Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize distances to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node, which is 0. In this case, the unvisited set would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 35, 41} and the distances would be {inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, 0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf}.\n\n2. Set the current node to the starting node (13) and create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n\n3. For the current node, calculate the distance to each of its neighbors (rooms 21, 24, and 9). Update the distance if it is shorter than the current distance stored in the distance list.\n\n4. Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n5. If the destination node (12) has been visited, we have found the shortest path. Append the destination node to the shortest path list and backtrack through the previous nodes by selecting the node with the shortest distance from the distance list. Append each node to the shortest path list until we reach the starting node.\n\n6. Reverse the order of the shortest path list to get the path from the starting node to the destination node.\n\nThe shortest path from room 13 to room 12 is: 13, 9, 41, 12.\n\nAnswer: 13, 9, 41, 12."
