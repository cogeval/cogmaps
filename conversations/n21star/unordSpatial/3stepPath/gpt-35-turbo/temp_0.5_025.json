Create a priority queue to store the distances to each field. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for the tulip field, which is set to 0.\n2. Start from the tulip field and update the distances to its neighboring fields: daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The distance to each neighboring field is 1, as they are directly connected.\n3. Select the field with the shortest distance from the priority queue. In this case, it is the daisy field.\n4. Update the distances to the daisy field's neighboring fields: tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The distance to each neighboring field is 1, as they are directly connected.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the lavender field is reached. At each step, update the distances to the neighboring fields and select the field with the shortest distance.\n6. Once the lavender field is reached, we can backtrack from the lavender field to the tulip field, following the path with the shortest distances.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the tulip field to the lavender field is:\n\nTulip, Daisy, Orchid, Aster, Lavender\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Daisy, Orchid, Aster, Lavender"
