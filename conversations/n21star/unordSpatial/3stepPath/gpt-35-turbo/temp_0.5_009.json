The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

Look at the neighboring fields connected to the rose field: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n3. Calculate the distance from the rose field to each neighboring field: sunflower = 1, tulip = 1, daisy = 1, orchid = 1, hydrangea = 1, lily = 1.\n4. Choose the field with the shortest distance, which is any of the neighboring fields.\n5. Move to the chosen field (let's say we choose the sunflower field).\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until we reach the iris field.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from the rose field to the iris field would be:\n\nRose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Iris.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Iris."
