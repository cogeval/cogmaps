The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.

Create a graph with 21 vertices, each representing a flower field. \n2. Add edges between the fields based on their connections as described in the information provided.\n3. Apply a shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path from the sunflower field to the iris field.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start from the sunflower field.\n2. Look at its connections: lily, daisy, tulip, orchid.\n3. Choose the next field with the shortest distance from the sunflower field. \n   In this case, both lily and daisy are connected to the sunflower field, so we choose the one with the shortest distance, which is lily.\n4. Move to the lily field.\n5. Look at its connections: sunflower, orchid, hydrangea.\n6. Choose the next field with the shortest distance from the sunflower field. \n   Since we have already visited the sunflower field, we skip it and choose orchid.\n7. Move to the orchid field.\n8. Look at its connections: sunflower, lily, tulip, daisy.\n9. Choose the next field with the shortest distance from the sunflower field. \n   Since we have already visited the sunflower and lily fields, we skip them and choose tulip.\n10. Move to the tulip field.\n11. Look at its connections: sunflower, daisy, orchid.\n12. Choose the next field with the shortest distance from the sunflower field. \n    Since we have already visited the sunflower and daisy fields, we skip them and choose orchid.\n13. Move to the orchid field.\n14. Look at its connections: sunflower, lily, tulip, daisy.\n15. Choose the next field with the shortest distance from the sunflower field. \n    Since we have already visited the sunflower, lily, tulip, and daisy fields, we skip them and choose iris.\n16. Arrive at the iris field.\n\nAnswer: Sunflower, Lily, Orchid, Tulip, Orchid, Iris"
