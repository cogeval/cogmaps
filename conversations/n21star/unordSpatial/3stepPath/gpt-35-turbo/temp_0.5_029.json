From the tulip field, we can go to the daisy field since they are connected.\n3. From the daisy field, we can go to the zinnia field since they are connected.\n4. From the zinnia field, we can go to the peony field since they are connected.\n5. From the peony field, we can go to the daffodil field since they are connected.\n6. From the daffodil field, we can go to the carnation field since they are connected.\n7. From the carnation field, we can go to the poppy field since they are connected.\n8. From the poppy field, we can go to the dahlia field since they are connected.\n9. From the dahlia field, we can go to the lavender field since they are connected.\n10. From the lavender field, we can go to the aster field since they are connected.\n11. Finally, from the aster field, we can reach the iris field.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the tulip field to the iris field is: Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Iris.\n\nAnswer: Tulip, Daisy, Zinnia, Peony, Daffodil, Carnation, Poppy, Dahlia, Lavender, Aster, Iris."
