We will start at the rose field and explore its neighboring fields, keeping track of the shortest distance from the starting field. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all fields with a distance of infinity, except for the rose field which will have a distance of 0.\n   - Rose: 0\n   - Sunflower: \u221e\n   - Tulip: \u221e\n   - Daisy: \u221e\n   - Orchid: \u221e\n   - Hydrangea: \u221e\n   - Lily: \u221e\n   - Marigold: \u221e\n   - Poppy: \u221e\n   - Zinnia: \u221e\n   - Peony: \u221e\n   - Daffodil: \u221e\n   - Chrysanthemum: \u221e\n   - Iris: \u221e\n   - Lavender: \u221e\n   - Aster: \u221e\n   - Dahlia: \u221e\n   - Hyacinth: \u221e\n   - Jasmine: \u221e\n   - Snapdragon: \u221e\n   - Carnation: \u221e\n\n2. Visit each neighboring field of the current field (starting with the rose field) and update their distances if a shorter path is found.\n   - The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields. Update their distances as follows:\n     - Sunflower: 1\n     - Tulip: 1\n     - Daisy: 1\n     - Orchid: 1\n     - Hydrangea: 1\n     - Lily: 1\n\n3. Select the field with the shortest distance as the new current field. In this case, it is the sunflower field with a distance of 1.\n\n4. Repeat step 2 for the new current field (sunflower) and update the distances of its neighboring fields.\n   - The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. Update its distance as follows:\n     - Daisy: 2\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the carnation field is reached.\n\n6. The shortest path from the rose field to the carnation field is as follows:\n   - Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Carnation\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Carnation"
