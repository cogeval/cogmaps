The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Rose is connected to the orchid field.\n2. Orchid is connected to the aster field.\n3. Aster is connected to the snapdragon field.\n\nShortest path to the snapdragon field: Rose, Orchid, Aster, Snapdragon (3 steps)\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path to the chrysanthemum field:\n1. Rose is connected to the sunflower field.\n2. Sunflower is connected to the daisy field.\n3. Daisy is connected to the zinnia field.\n4. Zinnia is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nShortest path to the chrysanthemum field: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Zinnia, Chrysanthemum (4 steps)\n\nAlthough the path to the chrysanthemum field is longer (4 steps) compared to the path to the snapdragon field (3 steps), the snapdragon field offers 50 flowers while the chrysanthemum field offers only 10 flowers.\n\nSince the task is to find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers, the path to the snapdragon field is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Aster, Snapdragon"

Rose is connected to the magnolia field.\n2. From the magnolia field, you can teleport to the lavender field (neighboring field of lavender).\n3. Lavender is connected to the aster field.\n4. Aster is connected to the snapdragon field.\n\nShortest path to the snapdragon field with teleportation: Rose, Magnolia, Lavender, Aster, Snapdragon (4 steps)\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path to the chrysanthemum field with the new information:\n1. Rose is connected to the magnolia field.\n2. From the magnolia field, you can teleport to the dahlia field (neighboring field of lavender).\n3. Dahlia is connected to the poppy field.\n4. Poppy is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n\nShortest path to the chrysanthemum field with teleportation: Rose, Magnolia, Dahlia, Poppy, Chrysanthemum (4 steps)\n\nAlthough both paths now have the same number of steps (4 steps), the snapdragon field still offers 50 flowers, while the chrysanthemum field offers only 10 flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers is still the path to the snapdragon field using the new teleportation portal.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Magnolia, Lavender, Aster, Snapdragon"
