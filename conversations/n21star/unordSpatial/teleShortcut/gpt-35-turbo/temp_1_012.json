The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field.

I will start by creating a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections.

Starting from the rose field, the initial distance to all other fields is infinity except for the rose field itself, which is 0.\n2. Set the priority queue with the rose field as the only element.\n3. Pop the field with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n4. For each neighbor of the popped field, calculate the distance from the start field through the popped field.\n5. If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the priority queue is empty.\n7. The final distances to all fields represent the shortest paths from the rose field.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Starting with the rose field:\n   - Distance to Rose field: 0 (already visited)\n   - Distance to Sunflower field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Tulip field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Daisy field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Orchid field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Hydrangea field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Lily field: Infinity\n2. Next, visit the Sunflower field (closest neighbor):\n   - Distance to Rose field: 0\n   - Distance to Sunflower field: 1 (visited)\n   - Distance to Tulip field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Daisy field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Orchid field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Hydrangea field: Infinity\n   - Distance to Lily field: Infinity\n3.
