Room 35 is connected to room 41. You have been told that there is a reward of 10 for visiting room 22. You are in room 24 and a portal appears with which you can teleport to any room only once.

            "content": "To maximize the reward, we need to first identify all the rooms that are connected to Room 24, and then recursively compute the maximum reward we can get from each of those rooms. We can use dynamic programming to store the results of each computation, so we don't have to recompute them multiple times.\n\nStarting from Room 24, we can move to Room 21 or Room 5. From Room 21, we can move to Room 1, Room 9, or Room 13. From Room 5, we can move to Room 1, Room 9, or Room 13. \n\nSo, we can recursively compute the maximum reward we can get from each of those rooms as follows:\n\n- From Room 1, we can move to Room 21, Room 5, Room 24, Room 9, Room 4, or Room 13. The maximum reward we can get from Room 1 is 0, as none of those rooms have a reward.\n- From Room 9, we can move to Room 13, Room 21, Room 5, Room 41, or Room 4. The maximum reward we can get from Room 9 is 0, as none of those rooms have a reward.\n- From Room 13, we can move to Room 24, Room 21, Room 9, Room 5, or Room 41. The maximum reward we can get from Room 13 is 0, as none of those rooms have a reward.\n\nNote that we don't need to compute the maximum reward we can get from Room 4, as it's already connected to Room 9, which we've already computed.\n\n- From Room 21, we can move to Room 24, Room 1, Room 9, or Room 13. The maximum reward we can get from Room 21 is 0, as none of those rooms have a reward.\n- From Room 5, we can move to Room 24, Room 1, Room 9, or Room 13. The maximum reward we can get from Room 5 is 0, as none of those rooms have a reward.\n\nWe've now computed the maximum reward we can get from all the rooms we can reach from Room 24. We can now simply choose the room that yields the most reward, which is Room 22 with a reward of 10.\n\nAnswer: 24, 22."
