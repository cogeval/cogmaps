The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.

The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

From the rose field, we can go to the following fields: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily. \n\n2. From the sunflower field, we can collect sunflower flowers. \n\n3. From the tulip field, we can collect tulip flowers. \n\n4. From the daisy field, we can collect daisy flowers. \n\n5. From the orchid field, we can collect orchid flowers. \n\n6. From the hydrangea field, we can collect hydrangea flowers. \n\n7. From the lily field, we can collect lily flowers. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of flowers we can collect from each of these fields: \n\n1. sunflower field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\n2. tulip field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\n3. daisy field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\n4. orchid field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\n5. hydrangea field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\n6. lily field: 0 flowers (not mentioned in the information provided)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: rose"
