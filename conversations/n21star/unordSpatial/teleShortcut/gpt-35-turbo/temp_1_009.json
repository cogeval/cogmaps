The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Starting from the rose field, we know that it is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n2. The sunflower field is connected to the lily, daisy, tulip, and orchid fields, but there are no free flowers available.\n3. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields. Again, no free flowers are available.\n4. The daisy field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, lily, and orchid fields. No free flowers here.\n5. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. Still, no free flowers.\n6. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. No free flowers.\n7. The lily field is connected to the sunflower and daisy fields. No free flowers.\n8. Since none of the fields directly connected to the rose field offer free flowers, we need to explore further.\n\n9. From the rose field, we can take the path to the hydrangea field, as it is connected to the lily field.\n10. From the hydrangea field, we can go to the lily field, which is connected to the sunflower field.\n11. From the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field, which is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n12. From the chrysanthemum field, we can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Hydrangea, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Chrysanthemum."

Starting from the rose field, we have the option to teleport directly to any neighboring field of the lavender field using the magnolia field.\n2. The lavender field is connected to the aster, dahlia, hyacinth, and snapdragon fields.\n3. From the lavender field, we can go to the aster field, which is connected to the orchid field.\n4. From the orchid field, we can go to the lily field, which is connected to the sunflower field.\n5. From the sunflower field, we can go to the daisy field, which is connected to the chrysanthemum field.\n6. From the chrysanthemum field, we can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from the rose field, considering the teleportation portal in the magnolia field, that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nAnswer: Rose, Magnolia, Lavender, Aster, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy, Chrysanthemum."
