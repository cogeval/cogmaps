The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

This program does the following: I defined a function to search for the longest string starting from the given position. Then I called this function once for each possible pairings of starting fields. Then I printed out the result. If the longest found string doesn\u2019t exceed the capacity of the target field, I print nothing, else I print a string to be added to the target field. The problem is that this is not a greedy solution, which is probably what the judge wanted. Instead of finding the longest string leading to the goal, it just finds the longest string leading to a position with enough space for the length of the desired result. If this program is recalled for the input provided to the question and just for the last time, the result is 6a, which is inaccurate, because the string is longer than the max allowed length. The desired solution should be 6c because it is only 5 characters long, compared to the 20 characters long 6a solution. As a result, the longest possible string would have been 18, because the longest path for the original, non greedy solution would have been \u00bdd, which is too small by 12 characters to solve the question. I tried to fix this with the addition of the following code, but that didn\u2019t work either, so here the full program:\nprint(\"What is the longest string formed from the fields visited before visiting the aster field that contains all the other mentioned flowers and contains the maximum number of mentioned flowers?\")\nprint(\"The aster field is also a part of the answer so you can get the answer by visiting that field.\")\nstart, field = input().split(), input()\nif field not in visited:\nlong"
