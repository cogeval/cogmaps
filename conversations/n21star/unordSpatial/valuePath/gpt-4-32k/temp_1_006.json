The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Since the snapdragon field yields more flowers, we will prioritize finding the shortest path to the snapdragon field.\n\nStep 2: List the fields connected to the rose field: sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily.\n\nStep 3: Identify the connections from these fields to other fields, focusing on finding the shortest path to the snapdragon field.\n\n- Sunflower connects to daisy.\n- Tulip connects to daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower.\n- Daisy connects to lily, sunflower, and zinnia.\n- Orchid connects to lily, sunflower, and aster.\n- Hydrangea connects to lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid.\n- Lily connects to sunflower and daisy.\n\nStep 4: Check if any of these fields directly connect to the snapdragon field. We find that none of them do.\n\nStep 5: Check for connections to the snapdragon field from one more step away:\n\n- Sunflower (via daisy) connects to zinnia.\n- Tulip (via orchid) connects to aster.\n- Daisy (via zinnia) connects to peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation.\n- Orchid (via aster) connects to iris, lavender, dahlia, hyacinth, and snapdragon.\n- Hydrangea (via orchid) connects to aster.\n- Lily does not have any new connections.\n\nStep 6: We find that the shortest path to the snapdragon field is through the orchid and aster fields.\n\nStep 7: List the flower fields in order: Rose, Orchid, Aster, Snapdragon.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Orchid, Aster, Snapdragon"
