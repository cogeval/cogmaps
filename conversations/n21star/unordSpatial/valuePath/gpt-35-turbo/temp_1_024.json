The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Create a graph representing the connections between the flower fields:\n   - Start with the rose field and add all the connected fields with their respective weights (number of flowers).\n   - Repeat this step for all other flower fields mentioned in the description.\n\n2. Initialize two arrays:\n   - Distance array: Set the distance from the rose field to all other fields as infinity, except for the rose field itself which is set to 0.\n   - Visited array: Set all fields as unvisited.\n\n3. While there are unvisited fields:\n   - Select the unvisited field with the smallest distance.\n   - For each connected field, calculate the total distance from the rose field.\n   - Update the distance array if the newly calculated distance is smaller than the current distance.\n\n4. Once all fields are visited, trace back the shortest path from the rose field to the field with the maximum number of flowers:\n   - Starting from the field with the maximum number of flowers, follow the path using the distance array.\n   - Keep track of the flower names as you traverse the path.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Daisy, Orchid, Lily, Sunflower, Snapdragon"
