The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the flower fields and their connections. We can represent each field as a node and the connections between fields as edges with weights equal to the number of flowers received.\n\n2. Initialize a distance array to keep track of the shortest distances from the start node (rose field) to each field. Set the distance for all fields except the start node to infinity.\n\n3. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited fields. Set the visited state for all fields to false.\n\n4. Start from the rose field and set its distance to 0.\n\n5. While there are unvisited fields:\n   a. Choose the field with the smallest distance and mark it as visited.\n   b. For each neighbor of the current field that has not been visited:\n      - Calculate the distance to the neighbor field as the sum of the current field's distance and the weight of the edge connecting them (number of flowers received).\n      - If this distance is smaller than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance.\n\n6. After visiting all fields, we can trace back the shortest path from the rose field to the field that yields the maximum number of flowers. Start from the field with the maximum number of flowers and follow the path by choosing the neighbor with the smallest distance until we reach the rose field.\n\nUsing these steps, we can determine the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field."
