The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Start at the rose field.\n2. The rose field is connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n3. Since we want the maximum number of flowers, we can ignore the hydrangea and lily fields as they do not offer any additional flowers.\n4. Choose the field with the maximum number of flowers, which is the sunflower field with 0 flowers.\n5. Move to the sunflower field.\n6. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field.\n7. Choose the field with the maximum number of flowers, which is the daisy field with 0 flowers.\n8. Move to the daisy field.\n9. The daisy field is connected to the tulip, orchid, and lily fields.\n10. Choose the field with the maximum number of flowers, which is the orchid field with 0 flowers.\n11. Move to the orchid field.\n12. The orchid field is connected to the lily field.\n13. Choose the field with the maximum number of flowers, which is the lily field with 0 flowers.\n14. Move to the lily field.\n15. The lily field is connected to the sunflower field.\n16. We have reached a cycle, and since we have already visited the sunflower field, we cannot proceed further.\n17. Our path from the rose field to the lily field is rose -> sunflower -> daisy -> orchid -> lily.\n\nAnswer: Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Orchid, Lily"
