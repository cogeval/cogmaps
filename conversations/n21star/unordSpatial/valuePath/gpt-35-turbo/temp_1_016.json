The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will start from the rose field and calculate the shortest path to each connected field, considering the number of flowers we can obtain from each field. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a list of all the fields and their connections:\n- Rose field: connected to the sunflower, tulip, daisy, orchid, hydrangea, and lily fields.\n- Sunflower field: connected to the daisy field.\n- Daisy field: connected to the zinnia, tulip, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n- Tulip field: connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields.\n- Orchid field: connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields.\n- Hydrangea field: connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields.\n- Lily field: connected to the sunflower and daisy fields.\n- Aster field: connected to the lavender and dahlia fields.\n- Zinnia field: connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n- Peony field: connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields.\n- Daffodil field: connected to the carnation and poppy fields.\n- Chrysanthemum field: connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields.\n- Carnation field: connected to the poppy field.\n- Poppy field: connected to the dahlia field.\n- Dahlia field: connected to the lavender field.\n- Lavender field: connected to the aster field.\n- Iris field: connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields.\n- Jasmine field: connected to the iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.\n- Snapdragon field: connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields.\n- Hyacinth field: connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields.\n- Marigold field: connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields.\n\n2. Initialize the distances from the rose field to all other fields with infinity, except the rose field itself which has a distance of 0.\n\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited fields.\n\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of flowers obtained from each field.\n\n5. While there are still unvisited fields:\n   - Find the field with the minimum distance from the rose field that has not been visited.\n   - Mark the field as visited.\n   - Update the distance to each connected field if it is shorter than the current distance.\n   - Update the number of flowers obtained from each connected field if it is greater than the current number of flowers.\n\n6. After visiting all fields, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers can be obtained by backtracking from the snapdragon field to the rose field, following the fields with the highest number of flowers.\n\nThe final outcome will be: Answer: Rose, Daisy, Snapdragon."
