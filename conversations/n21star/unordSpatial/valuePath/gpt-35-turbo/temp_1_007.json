The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field, we need to consider the connections between fields and the number of free flowers offered in each field. \n\nFrom the given information, we can construct a graph with each field as a node and the connections as edges. Additionally, we will assign the number of free flowers as the weight for each edge. \n\nFirst, let's list all the fields that can be reached from the rose field:\n\n1. Rose Field\n2. Sunflower Field\n3. Tulip Field\n4. Daisy Field\n5. Orchid Field\n6. Lily Field\n7. Hydrangea Field\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of flowers we can get from each path:\n\n1. Rose Field - 0 flowers\n2. Rose Field -> Sunflower Field - 0 flowers\n3. Rose Field -> Tulip Field - 0 flowers\n4. Rose Field -> Daisy Field - 0 flowers\n5. Rose Field -> Orchid Field - 0 flowers\n6. Rose Field -> Lily Field - 0 flowers\n7. Rose Field -> Hydrangea Field - 0 flowers\n\nSince there are no free flowers available in any of the connected fields, we cannot obtain any additional flowers by following any of these paths starting from the rose field. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers starting from the rose field is simply the rose field itself.\n\nAnswer: Rose Field"
