The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

Let's consider the number of flowers we can get from each field:\n\n- The sunflower field is not connected to any other fields that yield free flowers.\n- The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower fields. We can get a bunch of flowers from the daisy, orchid, and lily fields.\n- The daisy field is connected to the sunflower field. We can get a bunch of flowers from the sunflower field.\n- The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. We can get a bunch of flowers from the lily and sunflower fields.\n- The hydrangea field is not connected to any other fields that yield free flowers.\n- The lily field is connected to the sunflower and daisy fields. We can get a bunch of flowers from the sunflower field.\n\nBased on this analysis, the shortest path from the rose field that yields the maximum number of flowers is:\n\nRose, Tulip, Daisy, Sunflower\n\nAnswer: Rose, Tulip, Daisy, Sunflower"
