The marigold field is connected to the poppy, zinnia, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The iris field is connected to the lavender, aster, dahlia, hyacinth, jasmine, and snapdragon fields. The hydrangea field is connected to the lily, sunflower, tulip, daisy, and orchid fields. The tulip field is connected to the daisy, orchid, lily, and sunflower. The zinnia field is connected to the daisy, peony, daffodil, chrysanthemum, and carnation fields. The chrysanthemum field is connected to the carnation, poppy, peony, and daffodil fields. The jasmine field is connected to iris, lavender, aster, dahlia, and hyacinth fields. The orchid field is connected to the lily, sunflower, and aster fields. The peony field is connected to the daffodil, carnation, and poppy fields. The daffodil field is connected to the carnation, and poppy fields. The hyacinth field is connected to the snapdragon, lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The lily field is connected to the sunflower, and daisy fields. The carnation field is connected to the poppy field. The snapdragon field is connected to the lavender, aster, and dahlia fields. The sunflower field is connected to the daisy field. The poppy field is connected to the dahlia field. The dahlia field is connected to the lavender field. The lavender field is connected to the aster field. You have been told that if you visit snapdragon field, you can get a bunch of 50 snapdragon flowers for free and if you visit chrysanthemum field, you can get a bunch of 10 chrysanthemum flowers for free. Now, from the rose field what is the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers? Remember that you can only take one bunch of flowers and only from one field. Starting from the rose field, please list the flower names in order, including rose, separated by commas."

            "content": "Sure, I can help you with that.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field is:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, snapdragon (50 flowers)\n```\n\nThis path visits 2 fields and yields a total of 50 flowers. The snapdragon field offers the most flowers, so we should visit that field first. The rose field is also connected to the snapdragon field, so we can visit it on the way.\n\nThe regular expression for the final outcome is:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThe answer should be a list of flower names, separated by commas. The first flower name should be \"rose\". The list should end with the name of the field that offers the most flowers, which is \"snapdragon\".\n\nTherefore, the final outcome of the task is:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, snapdragon\n```\n\nAs you can see, this path yields more flowers than the path that includes the chrysanthemum field. This is because the chrysanthemum field only offers 10 flowers, while the snapdragon field offers 50 flowers.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the maximum number of flowers from the rose field is:\n\n```\nAnswer: rose, snapdragon (50 flowers)\n```"
