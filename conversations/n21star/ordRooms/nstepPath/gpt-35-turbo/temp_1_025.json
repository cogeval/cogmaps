Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 14 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 14.\n3. For each neighboring room of the current room:\n   a. Calculate the distance from the starting room to the neighboring room via the current room.\n   b. If this distance is less than the tentative distance previously assigned to the neighboring room, update the tentative distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. If the destination room (room 19) has been marked visited (its shortest distance found), stop. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance as the next current room and go back to step 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine that the shortest path from room 14 to room 19 is: 14, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 15, 19.\n\nAnswer: 14, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 15, 19."
