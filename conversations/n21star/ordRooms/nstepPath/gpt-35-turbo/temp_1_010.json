Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 4 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as the current room (room 4) and create a set of visited rooms that starts empty.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances by adding the weight of the edge that leads to them. If the resulting tentative distance is less than the current distance value, update the distance value of that room.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark it as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination room (room 21) has been visited or there are no more unvisited rooms.\n6. Once we have visited the destination room, we can backtrack from it to room 4 by following the path of lowest distance values. This will give us the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 4 to room 21 is: 4, 7, 2, 16, 15, 20, 21.\n\nAnswer: 4, 7, 2, 16, 15, 20, 21."
