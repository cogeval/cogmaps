In this case, the distance to room 5 remains 2.\n\n| Room | Distance |\n|------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |\n| 2    | 1        |\n| 3    | 2        |\n| 4    | 2        |\n| 5    | 2        |\n| 6    | 2        |\n| 7    | 1        |\n| 8    | \u221e        |\n| 9    | \u221e        |\n| 10   | \u221e        |\n| 11   | \u221e        |\n| 12   | \u221e        |\n| 13   | \u221e        |\n| 14   | 3        |\n| 15   | 3        |\n| 16   | \u221e        |\n| 17   | \u221e        |\n| 18   | \u221e        |\n| 19   | \u221e        |\n| 20   | \u221e        |\n| 21   | \u221e        |\n\n16.
