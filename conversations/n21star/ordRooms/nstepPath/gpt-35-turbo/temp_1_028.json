Assign a tentative distance value to every room: Infinity for all rooms except Room 16, which has a distance of 0. \n2. Set Room 16 as the current room and create an empty set of visited rooms.\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the distance from Room 16 to that room (which is the sum of the distance from Room 16 to the current room and the distance from the current room to the adjacent room).\n4. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance value of the adjacent room, update the distance value of the adjacent room with the calculated distance.\n5. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the list of unvisited rooms.\n6. If Room 14 is visited, we have found the shortest path. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance value and set it as the new current room. Go back to step 3.\n7. Once we have found the shortest path, we can trace it back from Room 14 to Room 16 using the distance values and the connections between the rooms.\n\nThe shortest path from Room 16 to Room 14 is: 16, 15, 20, 18, 10, 9, 14.\n\nAnswer: 16, 15, 20, 18, 10, 9, 14"
