Create a set of unvisited rooms and initialize distances from source (room 14) to all other rooms to infinity, except for the distance from room 14 to itself, which is 0.\n\n2. Set current room as room 14 and mark it as visited.\n\n3. For each of the unvisited adjacent rooms to the current room (rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11), calculate the distance from the source to that room through the current room (room 14). Update the distance to that room if it is shorter than the previously calculated distance.\n\n4. Select the unvisited room with the shortest distance from the source as the new current room and mark it as visited. In this case, it is room 11.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all unvisited adjacent rooms to the new current room (rooms 13 and 17).\n\n6. Continue this process until all rooms have been visited or the destination (room 21) has been reached.\n\nThe shortest path from room 14 to room 21 is: 14, 11, 13, 17, 15, 20, 21.\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 13, 17, 15, 20, 21"
