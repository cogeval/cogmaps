            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 16 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for the starting room and to infinity for all other rooms.\n    - Room 16: 0\n    - All other rooms: infinity\n\n2. Set the starting room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a room is the sum of the distance from the current room to that room and the tentative distance to the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example:\n    - Room 5 is a neighbor of room 16 and has a distance of 1. The tentative distance to room 5 is 0 (current room distance) + 1 (distance to neighbor) = 1. Update the tentative distance of room 5 to 1.\n    - Room 15 is a neighbor of room 16 and has a distance of 1. The tentative distance to room 15 is 0 (current room distance) + 1 (distance to neighbor) = 1. Update the tentative distance of room 15 to 1.\n\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new \"current room\" then go back to step 3.\n\n6. If the destination room (room 8) has been visited (its distance has been updated), then we have found the shortest path. The path can be obtained by backtracking from the destination room to the starting room using the minimum distances. Here is the shortest path from room 16 to room 8:\n    - Room 16, Room 15, Room 20, Room 18, Room 17, Room 13, Room 8\n\nAnswer: 16, 15, 20, 18, 17, 13, 8"
