Initialize the distance of room 5 as 0 and the rest as infinity. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 2    | 1        | false   |\n| 3    | 1        | false   |\n| 4    | 1        | false   |\n| 5    | 0        | false   |\n| 6    | 1        | false   |\n| 7    | 1        | false   |\n| 8    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 9    | \u221e        | false   |\n| 10   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 11   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 12   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 13   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 14   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 15   | 2        | false   |\n| 16   | 2        | false   |\n| 17   | 3        | false   |\n| 18   | 3        | false   |\n| 19   | \u221e        | false   |\n| 20   | 3        | false   |\n| 21   | \u221e        | false   |\n\n2. Set the current room as room 5. Visit room 5.\n\n3. For each room that is connected to the current room and is not visited, calculate the tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance and the distance between the two rooms. If the tentative distance is less than the distance in the table, update the table with the new distance.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Set the next current room as the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 5. If there are no unvisited rooms left, stop.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the current room is room 10.\n\nThe shortest path from room 5 to room 10 is: 5, 2, 8, 10\n\nAnswer: 5, 2, 8, 10"
