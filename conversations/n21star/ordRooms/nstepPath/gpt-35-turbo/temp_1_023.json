Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance to all nodes to infinity, except room 14 which is 0. \n\n2. Set the current node to room 14 and create an empty set of visited nodes. \n\n3. For each neighboring node of the current node, calculate the distance from room 14 to that node and update the distance if it is shorter than the current distance. \n\n4. Add the current node to the visited set and remove it from the unvisited nodes. \n\n5. If the destination node (room 15) has been visited, stop and return the shortest path. Otherwise, set the next current node to be the unvisited node with the shortest distance. \n\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until there are no more unvisited nodes. \n\nThe shortest path from room 14 to room 15 is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 14, 11, 17, 15\n```"
