            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 14 to room 16, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of vertices (rooms) to explore and their distances from the starting vertex (room 14). We initialize the starting vertex with distance 0 and all other vertices with infinite distance. At each step, we select the vertex with the smallest distance and explore its neighbors, updating their distances if a shorter path is found.\n\nHere are the steps to apply Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Set the distance of room 14 to 0, and all other rooms to infinity.\n2. Add room 14 to the priority queue with distance 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Extract the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   b. If the extracted vertex is room 16, we have found the shortest path and can stop. Otherwise, continue exploring its neighbors.\n   c. For each neighbor of the extracted vertex, calculate the distance to it through the extracted vertex and compare it with its current distance. If the new distance is smaller, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the priority queue.\n4. Once we have found the shortest path to room 16, we can reconstruct it by following the path of minimum distances from room 14 to room 16.\n\nBased on the connections given, the shortest path from room 14 to room 16 is:\n\n14, 11, 13, 17, 16\n\nAnswer: 14, 11, 13, 17, 16"
