From room 4, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14. From room 2, we can reach rooms 4, 5, 7, and 13. From room 5, we can reach rooms 2, 7, 16, and 4. From room 7, we can reach rooms 2, 4, and 6. From room 6, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. From room 13, we can reach rooms 8, 9, 10, 11, and 17.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can calculate the shortest path from room 3 to room 13 as follows:\n\n- Starting from room 3, the shortest distance to room 2 is 1.\n- From room 2, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1+1=2.\n- From room 4, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1+1+1=3.\n- From room 5, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1+1+1+2=5.\n- From room 7, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1+1+1+1=4.\n- From room 6, the shortest distance to room 13 is 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 3 to room 13 is 3, 2, 13. \n\nAnswer: 3, 2, 13"
