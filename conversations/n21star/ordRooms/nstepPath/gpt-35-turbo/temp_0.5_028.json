Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 16 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor through the current room.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Repeat from step 3 until the unvisited set is empty.\n6. Once we have determined the shortest path to every room, we can backtrack from room 14 to room 16 and list the rooms in order.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path from room 16 to room 14 is:\n\n16, 15, 20, 18, 10, 9, 8, 14\n\nAnswer: 16, 15, 20, 18, 10, 9, 8, 14"
