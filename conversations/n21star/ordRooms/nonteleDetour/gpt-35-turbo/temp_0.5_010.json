Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. \n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Create a list of unvisited rooms and set the distance to all rooms to infinity except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. Set the reward to all rooms to 0 except for rooms 10 and 20, which have rewards of 10 and 50, respectively.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the distance from the starting room to that room and the total reward collected along the way. If the total reward is greater than the reward currently stored for that room, update the reward.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance and set it as the new current room. Repeat steps 3-5 until all rooms have been visited or the current room is room 20.\n\n6. Trace back the path from room 20 to room 1 by selecting the room with the smallest distance among its adjacent rooms until we reach room 1.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20."
