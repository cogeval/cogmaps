Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1, we need to use Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In this case, the graph is the house with rooms as nodes and connections between them as edges. The weight of each edge is the distance between the two rooms.\n\nFirst, we need to create a table of distances from room 1 to all other rooms, using the connections provided:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 0                    |\n| 2    | 1                    |\n| 3    | 1                    |\n| 4    | 1                    |\n| 5    | 1                    |\n| 6    | 1                    |\n| 7    | 1                    |\n| 8    | 2                    |\n| 9    | 2                    |\n| 10   | 3                    |\n| 11   | 3                    |\n| 12   | 100                  |\n| 13   | 100                  |\n| 14   | 100                  |\n| 15   | 100                  |\n| 16   | 100                  |\n| 17   | 100                  |\n| 18   | 100                  |\n| 19   | 100                  |\n| 20   | 3                    |\n| 21   | 100                  |\n\nRooms 12-21 are not directly connected to room 1, so we assign them a distance of 100 for now.\n\nNext, we need to create a table of rewards for each room, using the information provided:\n\n| Room | Reward |\n|------|--------|\n| 1    | 0      |\n| 2    | 0      |\n| 3    | 0      |\n| 4    | 0      |\n| 5    | 0      |\n| 6    | 0      |\n| 7    | 0      |\n| 8    | 0      |\n| 9    | 0      |\n| 10   | 10     |\n| 11   | 0      |\n| 12   | 0      |\n| 13   | 0      |\n| 14   | 0      |\n| 15   | 0      |\n| 16   | 50     |\n| 17   | 0      |\n| 18   | 0      |\n| 19   | 0      |\n| 20   | 50     |\n| 21   | 0      |\n\nNow, we can start the Dijkstra's Algorithm by selecting the room with the shortest distance from room 1. In this case, it is room 2, with a distance of 1. We mark it as visited and update the distances of its neighbors (rooms 4, 5, 7, and 16) by adding the distance between the two rooms and their respective rewards. The new table looks like this:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Previous Room | Reward |\n|------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1    | 0                    |               | 0      |\n| 2    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 3    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 4    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 5    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 6    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 7    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 8    | 3                    |               | 0      |\n| 9    | 3                    |               | 0      |\n| 10   | 100                  |               | 10     |\n| 11   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 12   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 13   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 14   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 15   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 16   | 3                    | 2             | 50     |\n| 17   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 18   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 19   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 20   | 100                  |               | 50     |\n| 21   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n\nWe repeat this process by selecting the next room with the shortest distance (room 6) and updating the table accordingly:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Previous Room | Reward |\n|------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1    | 0                    |               | 0      |\n| 2    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 3    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 4    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 5    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 6    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 7    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 8    | 3                    | 9             | 0      |\n| 9    | 3                    | 8             | 0      |\n| 10   | 3                    | 9             | 10     |\n| 11   | 4                    | 10            | 0      |\n| 12   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 13   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 14   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 15   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 16   | 3                    | 2             | 50     |\n| 17   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 18   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 19   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 20   | 100                  |               | 50     |\n| 21   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n\nWe continue with this process until we reach room 20, which has the highest reward (50) and update the final table:\n\n| Room | Distance from Room 1 | Previous Room | Reward |\n|------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| 1    | 0                    |               | 0      |\n| 2    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 3    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 4    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 5    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 6    | 1                    | 1             | 0      |\n| 7    | 2                    | 2             | 0      |\n| 8    | 3                    | 9             | 0      |\n| 9    | 3                    | 8             | 0      |\n| 10   | 3                    | 9             | 10     |\n| 11   | 4                    | 10            | 0      |\n| 12   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 13   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 14   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 15   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n| 16   | 3                    | 2             | 50     |\n| 17   | 4                    | 13            | 0      |\n| 18   | 4                    | 16            | 0      |\n| 19   | 4                    | 15            | 0      |\n| 20   | 3                    | 16            | 50     |\n| 21   | 100                  |               | 0      |\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is the path from room 1 to room 2 to room 6 to room 1 to room 2 to room 16 to room 20, with a total reward of 50.
