Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we can visit rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, but none of them have a chest with a reward. Then, we can visit room 16, which has a chest with a reward of 50, but it is not the shortest path. Continuing, we can visit room 15, which does not have a chest with a reward, but it is a necessary step to reach room 20. From room 15, we can visit room 20, which has a chest with a reward of 50, and then backtrack to room 15. Next, we can visit room 18, which does not have a chest with a reward, but it is a necessary step to reach room 10. From room 18, we can visit room 17, which has a chest with a reward of 10, and then backtrack to room 13. Finally, we can visit room 10, which has a chest with a reward of 10. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 15, 20, 15, 18, 17, 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 15, 20, 15, 18, 17, 10."
