We start by setting the distance from room 1 to itself as 0 and the distance to all other rooms as infinity. We then visit each adjacent room and update its distance and reward if it is shorter than the current distance and reward. We continue visiting adjacent rooms until we have visited all rooms or until the destination room (room 10 or room 20) has been visited.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 10\n\nThis path has a distance of 3 and a reward of 10. Note that the path 1, 2, 16, 5, 7, 4, 10 also has a distance of 3 but a lower reward of 0. Therefore, the path 1, 2, 4, 10 is the best option. \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 10"
