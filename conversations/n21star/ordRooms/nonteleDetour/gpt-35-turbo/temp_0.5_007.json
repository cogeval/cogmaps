Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward found along the way. Then, we can choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can calculate the shortest path and maximum reward for each room as follows:\n\nRoom 1: Reward 0\nRoom 2: Reward 0\nRoom 3: Reward 0\nRoom 4: Reward 0\nRoom 5: Reward 0\nRoom 6: Reward 0\nRoom 7: Reward 0\nRoom 8: Reward 0\nRoom 9: Reward 0\nRoom 10: Reward 10\nRoom 11: Reward 0\nRoom 12: Reward 0\nRoom 13: Reward 0\nRoom 14: Reward 0\nRoom 15: Reward 0\nRoom 16: Reward 0\nRoom 17: Reward 0\nRoom 18: Reward 0\nRoom 19: Reward 0\nRoom 20: Reward 50\nRoom 21: Reward 0\n\nStarting from room 1, the shortest path that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 10 and is the shortest path that leads to a chest with a reward. The other path that leads to a chest with a reward, 1, 15, 20, has a higher reward but is longer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
