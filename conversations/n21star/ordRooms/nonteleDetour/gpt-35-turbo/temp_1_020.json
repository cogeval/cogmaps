Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The distances are calculated as follows:\n\n- Room 10: 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 (total distance = 4)\n- Room 20: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 11 -> 13 -> 17 -> 20 (total distance = 7)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starts in room 1 and ends in room 10, with a reward of 10.
