Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."
