The algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. First, we need to create a weighted graph representing the connections between the rooms and the rewards in each chest. Then, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1 and find the shortest path that yields the most reward. \n\nThe weighted graph can be represented as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  1: {2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0},\n  2: {1: 0, 3: 0, 4: 10, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0},\n  3: {1: 0, 2: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0},\n  4: {1: 0, 2: 10, 3: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 10, 8: 0, 14: 0},\n  5: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 6: 0, 7: 10, 16: 0},\n  6: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0},\n  7: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 10, 6: 0},\n  8: {9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 14: 0},\n  9: {8: 0, 10: 0, 11: 10, 13: 10},\n  10: {8: 0, 9: 10, 11: 0, 13: 0, 14: 10},\n  11: {8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 10, 13: 10},\n  12: {8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 14: 0},\n  13: {8: 0, 9: 10, 10: 0, 11: 0, 17: 50},\n  14: {4: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 10, 11: 10, 12: 0},\n  15: {16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0, 20: 0},\n  16: {5: 0, 15: 0, 17: 0, 20: 0},\n  17: {13: 50, 15: 0, 16: 0, 18: 0, 20: 0},\n  18: {15: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0, 20: 0},\n  19: {15: 0, 18: 0, 20: 0},\n  20: {15: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0, 21: 50},\n  21: {20: 0}\n}\n```\n\nwhere the keys are the room numbers and the values are dictionaries of the rooms that are connected and the corresponding rewards.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1, we get the following shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n```\n1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 16, 15, 17, 13, 20\n```\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 16, 15, 17, 13, 20\n```"
