Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we will calculate the shortest path to every other room and keep track of the maximum reward found along each path. Then, we will select the path with the highest reward.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to every room as infinity, except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. Also, initialize the maximum reward found along each path as 0 for every room.\n2. Create a priority queue and add room 1 with distance 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Pop the room with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For every room connected to the popped room:\n     - Calculate the distance to the connected room as the sum of the distance to the popped room and the distance between them.\n     - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance to the connected room, update the distance and the maximum reward found along the path to that room.\n     - Add the connected room to the priority queue with the updated distance.\n4. The shortest path that yields the most reward is the path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward found along its path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThe reward collected along this path is 50, which is the maximum reward possible. \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
