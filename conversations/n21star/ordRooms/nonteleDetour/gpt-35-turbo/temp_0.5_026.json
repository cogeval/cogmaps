Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

First, we assign a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1, which has a tentative distance of 0. Then, we visit each connected room to room 1 and update their tentative distances based on the reward in the chest and the distance to the room. We continue this process until we reach room 20 or room 10, whichever comes first. \n\nThe tentative distances and previous rooms for each room after running Dijkstra's algorithm are:\n\nRoom 1: Distance 0, Previous None\nRoom 2: Distance 50, Previous 1\nRoom 3: Distance 60, Previous 2\nRoom 4: Distance 50, Previous 2\nRoom 5: Distance 50, Previous 2\nRoom 6: Distance 50, Previous 1\nRoom 7: Distance 50, Previous 1\nRoom 8: Distance 60, Previous 4\nRoom 9: Distance 70, Previous 8\nRoom 10: Distance 70, Previous 9\nRoom 11: Distance 80, Previous 10\nRoom 12: Distance Infinity, Previous None\nRoom 13: Distance 130, Previous 11\nRoom 14: Distance Infinity, Previous None\nRoom 15: Distance 100, Previous 20\nRoom 16: Distance 60, Previous 5\nRoom 17: Distance 140, Previous 13\nRoom 18: Distance 110, Previous 15\nRoom 19: Distance 160, Previous 20\nRoom 20: Distance 150, Previous 15\nRoom 21: Distance Infinity, Previous None\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is to go to room 2, then to room 4, and finally to room 20 to collect the reward of 50.
