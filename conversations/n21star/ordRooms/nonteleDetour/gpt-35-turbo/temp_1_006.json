Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Assign a tentative distance of infinity to every room except for room 1, which has a tentative distance of 0. Create a set of unvisited rooms containing all the rooms.\n\n2. For the current room (which initially is room 1), calculate the tentative distances to all its neighboring rooms (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The tentative distance to a neighboring room is the sum of the distance from the current room to that room (which is always 1 since all the rooms are connected by one door) and the reward in that room (which is 0 if there is no chest or the chest has already been collected).\n\n3. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n4. From the unvisited rooms, select the room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. Repeat step 2 for this new current room.\n\n5. Continue iterating until the destination room (room 20 or room 10) is visited.\n\n6. Once the destination room is visited, backtrack from that room to room 1, following the path of smallest tentative distances. Collect the reward in the first chest encountered and stop.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThe reward collected is 50, from the chest in room 20. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
