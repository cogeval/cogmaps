Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we will compute the shortest path to every other room, keeping track of the maximum reward found along the way. We will then choose the path with the maximum reward.\n\nHere are the steps of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a list of distances and rewards. For each room, set the distance to infinity and the reward to zero. Set the distance of room 1 to zero.\n\n2. Initialize a priority queue with all the rooms, ordered by distance.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n  a. Remove the room with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n  b. For each adjacent room, compute the distance and reward of the path that goes through this room. If this path has a lower distance and a higher reward than the previous path, update the distance and reward of the adjacent room and add it to the priority queue.\n\n4. Once all the distances and rewards have been computed, find the room with the highest reward among the rooms that can be reached from room 1.\n\n5. Trace back the path that led to this room, starting from the room itself and following the rooms with decreasing distance until reaching room 1.\n\nAccording to the information given, the rooms connected to Room 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Only room 20 and room 10 have rewards. Room 10 has a reward of 10 and room 20 has a reward of 50.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 15, 20\n\nThis path has a total distance of 9 and a total reward of 50, which is the maximum possible reward."
