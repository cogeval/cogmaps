Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by initializing the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which is 0. We also initialize a list of visited rooms and a list of unvisited rooms, which initially contains all rooms. We then loop through the unvisited rooms and for each room, we update the distance to its neighbors if it's shorter than the current distance. We also keep track of the room with the highest reward that we've visited so far. Once we've visited all rooms, we return the path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 10, which is the highest possible reward we can get starting from room 1.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
