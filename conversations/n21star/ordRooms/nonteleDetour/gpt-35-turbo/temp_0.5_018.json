Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Starting from room 1, we can compute the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward found along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array with all values set to infinity, except for room 1 which is set to 0. Initialize a reward array with all values set to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue and add room 1 with distance 0 and reward 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue the room with the smallest distance and process its neighbors:\n    - If the neighbor has not been visited yet, compute its tentative distance as the sum of the current room's distance and the distance to the neighbor, and its tentative reward as the sum of the current room's reward and the reward in the neighbor (if any).\n    - If the tentative distance is smaller than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance and reward, and enqueue it with the new values.\n4. Once all rooms have been visited, the maximum reward found is the answer.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following solution:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20"
