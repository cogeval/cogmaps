To find the way we can make, beginning within a room in just, one path that gives you rewards will get one from room with one hundred will result chest by collecting the maximum amount reward available from the house. When trying to take chests it comes down to taking steps toward other than taking random moves which are pointless so will focus not just about random rooms to enter each which connect other each have potential loot first before you check how loot connect each room I\u2019ve noticed I took so we focus in more room reward per entry this approach is always be key! Always think in term taking it reels! I have come down all these details this problem so my approach to the shortest one collect locker maximum reward available to get each and step before I try. With this approach I started by getting lockets list for entering chest which you are starting and which gives collecting first I entered your starting on the reward per step is available and have not. So lets start! As I collected in a great reward that connect this path, rooms 1! Collector the rooms available are always first which available always chest and will try it first, please let me know to proceed rooms connected room one or 7  please enter cheste reward from reward for  please. Enter rooms connected cheste to you before other to not have chests, but room 1 connected to 7  the rooms: rooms which 1 is 3, let \nlet\n Answer :22.,"
