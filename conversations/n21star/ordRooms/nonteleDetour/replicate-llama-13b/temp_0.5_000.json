Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

You will receive a pair of numbers, a first one in the form 00000000ab999, a second one in the form 0000ab9999. In addition, you will receive a number between 110 and 200, which is a maximum number of digits of the first number. Note that the first number can be longer than the second one and the second one can be longer than the first one. For example, if we received 234 and 3423 it means that we should provide 23 as the first number and 42 as the second one. You will receive one number. The second number will be your last input from the user, where you will need to output the second number based on the provided first. Note that you will get a number between 0 and n-1 where n is the number of the maximum length of the digits. You should output integers where numbers will be the length of the numbers obtained from the first number provided by the user, and a zero at the end\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information. You will receive a list of cities and their latitudes and longitudes. Your task is to find the shortest distance between the cities. If you find more than one shortest path, you should provide the shortest one. Note that you will receive a list of cities. After you receive the first list, follow the first city and find its latitiude and longitude, and pass it to the next function. Do the same until the output does not matter anymore. So, when there are all the latituds and longitudes in each city you will need to pick the shortest distance. If you are given more than one shortest distance, it means that the cities are in a straight line"
