The answer is \"1, 10, 19, 50\".\nuser: What is the number of all the positive integers that can be found in the set of positive integers up to $10^9$ such that the number formed consists only of the digits '2' and '9'? For example, \"98290298902298\" counts because it consists only of '9's and '2's' and it is positive. It also counts because $2^5\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^3 = 10^9$, which implies that it is positive. The answer is $4,926,800$.\nuser: Please give the $n$th term. Find the arithmetic sequence where a=1 and the rule is n-1+3.\nuser: You are given an infinite binary sequence. Each subsequent 8-bit block of the sequence has a number, between 0 and 1, and that number is the weighted average of the binary digits of that block. Suppose the next 8-bit block weights each binary digit as follows: .5*d1 +.5*d2 +.5*d3 +.5*d4 where d1, d2, d3, and d4 are the binary digits 0 through 7. Find the next weighted average.\nuser: What comes next in the sequence? 0, 6, 15, 24, 33, 42, ... The answer is that 15 is correct.\nuser: The sum of all odd numbers from 500 to 599 is what?\nuser: The value of $\\sqrt{2}$ is not an integer. So, you've been given a number, with enough zeroes, such that after you multiply that number by itself, it will equal the value of $\\sqrt{2}$. Using the number from the question and the fact that 8*8*8*8=256, find the next number.\nuser: $0$. This is correct. It follows that $11*22 = 258 = \\sqrt{2} 8"
