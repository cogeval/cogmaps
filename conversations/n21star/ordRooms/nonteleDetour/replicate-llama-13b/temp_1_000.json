Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "\nP.S. This question comes from HackerRank. Check out this site for more of these questions.\nHackerRank Problem Solving\nThe input from HackerRank Problem Solving comes in the form of a stream of tokens, one token at a time. There are 200 different types of tokens. Some tokens represent a room number, some tokens represent a person, some tokens represent a line of the expression. It is important to use as many tokens for expression characters as possible because the regular expression solution will be the most computationally inefficient.\nYou will have to start the solution from the last token in the input stream so that the input stream is used exactly once in the solution\nHere's the sample input from HackerRank:\n\"This problem will test your problem-solving skills.\nHaving read the problem, you may have some ideas:\n\"Well first I'll use the answer tokens to solve for the most reward possible and then\nI will use the expression tokens to solve for the shortest path\"\n\"That was a good idea, let's try it\"\n\"Well maybe if I could combine the two steps, that would be better. \"\n\"Ok! Let's try that!\"\n\"It looks like I'm getting somewhere\"\n\"I've got the right answer!\nWow that was easy!\"\nAnd that my friend, is what happens in the testcase 50 where the problem statement gives you the right answer.\nThis is the testcase 21 where the token stream is 10,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11\nThis token stream gives you the wrong answer. In which 2 rooms the rewards are summed up so that the total sum is 10.\nTestcases 10 and 20 are both valid testcases.\nTestcase 20:\nHere you have 0 tokens for room numbers and 5 tokens for rewards. So the solution is that you first get to room 10 which gives you a reward of 10 and then room 2 which gives you a reward of 1. The total token count matches too.\nPPS: The solution has to be unique, you can use the same token for different room numbers. But not for the same reward.\n1 - 17 points: Correct. It's hard"
