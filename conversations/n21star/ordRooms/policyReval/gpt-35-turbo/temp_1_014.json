Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will also create a set of unvisited rooms which will initially include all rooms except Room 1.\n\nNext, we will calculate the tentative distances for each connected room to Room 1. The tentative distance to Room 2 is 0+1=1, the tentative distance to Room 3 is 0+1=1, and so on. We will also keep track of the room from which we arrived at each connected room (for example, the path to Room 2 is 1->2).\n\nThen we will select the unvisited room with the lowest tentative distance (in this case, Room 2) and repeat the previous step for all its connected rooms. We will continue this process until we have visited all rooms or until the remaining unvisited rooms have a tentative distance of infinity.\n\nOnce we have visited all rooms, we can trace the shortest path from Room 1 to Room 20 and Room 10. We can then compare the rewards and select the room with the highest reward. \n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is Room 1 -> Room 2 -> Room 4 -> Room 14 -> Room 10. This path has a total reward of 10. \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"

If a room contains a chest, we will set its reward to the amount specified (50 for Room 20, 10 for Room 10, and 100 for Room 12). If a room does not contain a chest, we will set its reward to 0. \n\nThen, for each room, we will check the rewards of all the rooms that can be reached from it and select the maximum reward. We will also keep track of the room that provides the maximum reward. \n\nStarting from Room 1, we will follow the shortest path to the room that provides the maximum reward. If the maximum reward is 0, we will stop because there are no more chests to collect.\n\nFollowing this process, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is Room 1 -> Room 12. This path has a total reward of 100.\n\nAnswer: 1, 12"
