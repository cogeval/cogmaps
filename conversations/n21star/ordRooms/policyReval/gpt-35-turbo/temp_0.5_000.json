Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10.

First, we create a graph with the given connections between the rooms and assign a weight of 0 to all the connections except the ones leading to the chests with rewards of 50 and 10, which are assigned weights of 50 and 10, respectively. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to any of the two reward chests. \n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to the chest with a reward of 50 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 17, 20. The reward collected is 50.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to the chest with a reward of 10 is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 10.
