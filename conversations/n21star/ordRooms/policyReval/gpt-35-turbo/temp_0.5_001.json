Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we will calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the maximum reward found along the way. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all rooms as infinity, except for room 1 which is 0. Initialize the maximum reward found so far as 0.\n2. Consider all the rooms connected to room 1 (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). Update their distance as the sum of the distance to room 1 (which is 0) and the distance to the room itself (which is 1). If the room contains a chest with a higher reward than the maximum reward found so far, update the maximum reward found so far.\n3. Among the rooms connected to room 1, choose the one with the shortest distance and mark it as visited.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the room just marked as visited, until we reach room 20 or room 10.\n5. Once we reach either room 20 or room 10, we can stop the algorithm and return the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 10\n\nThis path has a total distance of 5 and a total reward of 10. Note that we did not consider room 20 because it has a lower reward than room 10, even though it is closer to room 1. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 10"
