Then, we will visit each room in order of increasing distance from room 1, updating the distances and maximum rewards of neighboring rooms as we go.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Set distance to all rooms except for room 1 to infinity, and set distance to room 1 to 0.\n2. Set maximum reward to all rooms to 0.\n3. Set maximum reward to room 20 and room 10 to 50 and 10, respectively.\n4. Visit room 1.\n5. Update the distance and maximum reward of neighboring rooms (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).\n6.
