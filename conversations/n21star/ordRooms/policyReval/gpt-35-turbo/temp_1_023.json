We will treat the rewards in the chests as edge weights. \n\nFirst, we will create a graph with the rooms and their connections:\n\n```\n{\n1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],\n4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 14],\n5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 16],\n6: [1, 2, 5, 7],\n7: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n8: [4, 9, 10, 11, 13],\n9: [8, 10, 11, 13],\n10: [8, 9, 11, 13, 20],\n11: [8, 9, 10, 13],\n12: [13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17],\n14: [4, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],\n16: [5, 15, 17, 20],\n17: [13, 15, 16, 19, 20],\n18: [15, 16, 17, 20],\n19: [15, 17, 20, 21],\n20: [10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],\n21: [15, 19]\n}\n```\n\nNext, we will assign the rewards as edge weights:\n\n```\n{\n1: {2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0},\n2: {1: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0},\n3: {1: 0, 2: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0},\n4: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 14: 0},\n5: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 16: 0},\n6: {1: 0, 2: 0, 5: 0, 7: 0},\n7: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0},\n8: {4: 0, 9: 0, 10: 10, 11: 0, 13: 0},\n9: {8: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0},\n10: {8: 0, 9: 0, 11: 0, 13: 0, 20: 50},\n11: {8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 13: 0},\n12: {13: 0, 14: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0},\n13: {8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 0, 17: 0},\n14: {4: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0},\n15: {16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0, 20: 0, 21: 0},\n16: {5: 0, 15: 0, 17: 0, 20: 0},\n17: {13: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0, 19: 0, 20: 10},\n18: {15: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0, 20: 0},\n19: {15: 0, 17: 0, 20: 0, 21: 0},\n20: {10: 50, 15: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0},\n21: {15: 0, 19: 0}\n}\n```\n\nNow we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path with the most reward from room 1 to room 10 or 20.
