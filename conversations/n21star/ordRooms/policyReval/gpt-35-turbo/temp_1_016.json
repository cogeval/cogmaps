Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a table to store the shortest distance from room 1 to each room. Initialize all distances to infinity except for room 1, which has distance 0.\n\n2. Create a set to keep track of visited rooms, initially empty.\n\n3. Repeat the following until the set of visited rooms contains room 20 or room 10:\n\n   a. From the set of unvisited rooms, select the room with the shortest distance from room 1. If there are multiple rooms with the same shortest distance, select the one with the highest reward.\n\n   b. For each neighboring room that is unvisited, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room. If this distance is less than the current shortest distance to the neighboring room, update the table with the new shortest distance and record the current room as the predecessor of the neighboring room.\n\n   c. Mark the current room as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited rooms.\n\n4. To find the path with the most reward, start at the room with the chest of highest value (room 20) or (room 10) and work backwards by following the predecessor recorded for each room in the table until you reach room 1. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 17, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 14, 17, 20"
