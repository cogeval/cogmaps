Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will start by assigning a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1, which will have a tentative distance of 0. We will also create a set of unvisited rooms, initially containing all rooms.\n\nThen, we will repeat the following steps until we have visited all rooms:\n\n1. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and mark it as visited.\n2. For each neighboring room that is still unvisited, calculate its tentative distance as the sum of the current room's tentative distance and the distance to that neighboring room. If this tentative distance is smaller than the neighboring room's current tentative distance, update the neighboring room's tentative distance.\n3. If the current room is room 20 or room 10, stop the algorithm.\n\nOnce we have found either room 20 or room 10, we can trace back the shortest path that led to that room by following the lowest tentative distance at each step. If we reach a room that has a reward chest, we can stop and return the path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 10\n\nThis path has a total distance of 10 and collects the reward of 10 from room 10.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
