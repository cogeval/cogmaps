Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from Room 1, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room and keep track of the maximum reward found along the way. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from Room 1 is:\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20\n\nThis path has a total distance of 14 and a total reward of 50. Note that we did not visit Room 6, even though it is connected to Room 2 and has a chest with a reward of 5, because the reward of 50 in Room 20 is greater than the reward of 5 in Room 6. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20."
