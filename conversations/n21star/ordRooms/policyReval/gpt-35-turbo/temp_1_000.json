Starting from room 4, we can find the shortest paths to all other rooms and keep track of the total rewards along the way. Then we can choose the path with the highest total reward.\n\nThe shortest paths and total rewards from room 4 to all other rooms are:\n\nRoom 2: 4-2, reward = 0\nRoom 3: 4-3, reward = 0\nRoom 5: 4-5, reward = 0\nRoom 6: 4-6-7-2, reward = 0\nRoom 7: 4-7-2, reward = 0\nRoom 8: 4-14-8, reward = 0\nRoom 9: 4-14-9, reward = 0\nRoom 10: 4-14-9-10, reward = 5\nRoom 11: 4-14-9-11, reward = 0\nRoom 12: 4-12-13, reward = 0\nRoom 13: 4-14-13, reward = 10\nRoom 15: 4-5-16-15, reward = 0\nRoom 16: 4-5-16, reward = 0\nRoom 17: 4-14-13-17, reward = 0\nRoom 18: 4-5-16-15-18, reward = 0\nRoom 19: 4-5-16-15-19, reward = 0\nRoom 20: 4-5-16-15-20, reward = 0\nRoom 21: 4-5-16-15-20-21, reward = 0\n\nThe path with the highest total reward is 4-14-9-10, which yields a total reward of 5.
