Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

From room 2, we can go to room 4, which leads to room 14 where there is a chest with a reward of 10. \n4. From room 3, we can go to room 4, which also leads to room 14. \n5. From room 4, we can either go to room 14 (which we have already visited) or room 8, which leads to room 10 where there is a chest with a reward of 10. \n6. From room 5, we can go to room 16, which leads to room 20 where there is a chest with a reward of 50. \n7. From room 2, 3, and 4, there is no other path that leads to either reward chest, so we can eliminate them. \n8. From room 8, we can go to room 9, which leads to room 13 and then to room 17 where there is a chest with a reward of 50. \n9. From room 9, we can only go to room 11, which does not lead to any reward chest. \n10. From room 13, we can only go to room 17 where there is a chest with a reward of 50. \n\nBased on the above analysis, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 5, 16, 20. \n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 16, 20."
