Create a table with the following columns: Room, Distance, Visited, and Previous. Set the initial distance of all rooms to infinity, except for room 1 which is set to 0. Set Visited to False for all rooms and Previous to None for all rooms.\n2. Mark room 1 as visited.\n3. For each room connected to room 1, update its distance to the reward value if it has a chest, and update its Previous to room 1.\n4. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance and mark it as visited.\n5. For each room connected to the chosen room, update its distance to the maximum of its current distance and the reward value if it has a chest, plus the distance of the chosen room. If the distance was updated, update its Previous to the chosen room.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the destination room (room 20 or room 10) is visited.\n7. Backtrack from the destination room using the Previous column to get the shortest path.\n\nThe table after step 3 will look like this:\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited | Previous |\n|------|----------|---------|----------|\n| 1    | 0        | True    | None     |\n| 2    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 3    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 4    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 5    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 6    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 7    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 8    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 9    | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 10   | 10       | False   | 1        |\n| 11   | 0        | False   | 1        |\n| 12   | inf      | False   | None     |\n| 13   | 0        | False   | 11       |\n| 14   | 0        | False   | 4        |\n| 15   | 0        | False   | 20       |\n| 16   | 0        | False   | 5        |\n| 17   | 50       | False   | 13       |\n| 18   | 0        | False   | 15       |\n| 19   | inf      | False   | None     |\n| 20   | 50       | False   | 15       |\n| 21   | inf      | False   | None     |\n\nThe table after step 6 will look like this:\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited | Previous |\n|------|----------|---------|----------|\n| 1    | 0        | True    | None     |\n| 2    | 50       | True    | 7        |\n| 3    | 50       | True    | 2        |\n| 4    | 50       | True    | 2        |\n| 5    | 50       | True    | 2        |\n| 6    | 50       | True    | 7        |\n| 7    | 50       | True    | 1        |\n| 8    | 50       | True    | 9        |\n| 9    | 50       | True    | 11       |\n| 10   | 60       | True    | 9        |\n| 11   | 50       | True    | 13       |\n| 12   | inf      | False   | None     |\n| 13   | 60       | True    | 11       |\n| 14   | 50       | True    | 4        |\n| 15   | 100      | True    | 20       |\n| 16   | 100      | True    | 5        |\n| 17   | 110      | True    | 13       |\n| 18   | 100      | True    | 15       |\n| 19   | inf      | False   | None     |\n| 20   | 100      | True    | 15       |\n| 21   | inf      | False   | None     |\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 7, 2, 4, 14, 8, 9, 10.
