I guess there needs some logic here To have this path I'll use a queue of undiscovered connected rooms that ends with unlocked reward rooms first,second...and last(or lack them!), Also should keep room sequence when we need To keep tracing back. Let me pause and begin step2 first! please hold ur question... I Think...  AH-ha  I need A Doll- house- Like Room Layout Picture/Map Or sketches Here(just a picture or text sketch would Do... OR sketch them ur self), This will give direction into spatial arrangments logic... as u already Kn ow I Cant think in A mere Sentential Logic Way but rather In Picture based,Spatial and LInguistic Way.! OK, Here what you can help with, Any Room Sk ech (or Simple descri Ps!!) U Need Me 2 Visualize to move Step- further. Thank U!?! ... ?Wait,  Before we move let me put 3 questions That M-Ight b heLp me make th Thinking Process Quicker: Ok Which reword would You Give this pRoblem (other that Ttraverse a maze in rooms): Collecti g Puzzle pieces? connecting The correct pe ces Incorrect way Woud collectu nothing), or Shpircalling a map(fill ling in regions)  If it Would hElp 5-Second Imagization Could be of gReAt assistance!
