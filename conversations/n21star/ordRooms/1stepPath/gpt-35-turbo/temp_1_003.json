Create a list to keep track of visited rooms and add room 1 to it.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first room in the queue and check its connections.\n4. If one of the connections is room 5, then we have found the shortest path. Return the path (including rooms 1 and 5).\n5. Otherwise, for each unvisited connected room, add it to the queue and the visited list.\n6. If we have checked all connected rooms and have not found room 5, repeat from step 3.\n\nApplying these steps, the shortest path from room 1 to room 5 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 5"
