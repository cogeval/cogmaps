The graph can be represented as follows:\n\n```\n{1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n 2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],\n 4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14],\n 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 16],\n 6: [1, 2, 5, 7],\n 7: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n 8: [9, 10, 11, 13, 14],\n 9: [8, 10, 11, 13, 14],\n 10: [8, 9, 11, 13, 14],\n 11: [8, 9, 10, 13, 14],\n 12: [13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n 13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17],\n 14: [4, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n 15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],\n 16: [5, 15, 17],\n 17: [13, 15, 16, 18, 20],\n 18: [15, 17, 20],\n 19: [15],\n 20: [15, 17, 18, 21],\n 21: [15, 20]}\n```\n\nWe can start by initializing the distance from room 4 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 4 itself which has distance 0. Then, we repeatedly choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, and update the distances of its neighbors. We stop when we reach room 14.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize distances:\n\n   ```\n   distances = {4: 0,\n                1: float('inf'),\n                2: float('inf'),\n                3: float('inf'),\n                5: float('inf'),\n                6: float('inf'),\n                7: float('inf'),\n                8: float('inf'),\n                9: float('inf'),\n                10: float('inf'),\n                11: float('inf'),\n                12: float('inf'),\n                13: float('inf'),\n                14: float('inf'),\n                15: float('inf'),\n                16: float('inf'),\n                17: float('inf'),\n                18: float('inf'),\n                19: float('inf'),\n                20: float('inf'),\n                21: float('inf')}\n   ```\n\n2. Set of unvisited rooms:\n\n   ```\n   unvisited = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21}\n   ```\n\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance (room 4), and update the distances of its neighbors:\n\n   ```\n   for neighbor in [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]:\n       distances[neighbor] = min(distances[neighbor], distances[4] + 1)\n   ```\n\n4. Mark room 4 as visited, and repeat step 3 with the new set of unvisited rooms:\n\n   ```\n   visited = {4}\n   unvisited = unvisited - visited\n\n   current = 1\n   while current != 14:\n       for neighbor in graph[current]:\n           if neighbor in unvisited:\n               distances[neighbor] = min(distances[neighbor], distances[current] + 1)\n\n       visited.add(current)\n       unvisited = unvisited - visited\n\n       current = min(unvisited, key=lambda x: distances[x])\n   ```\n\n5. Return the shortest path from room 4 to room 14:\n\n   ```\n   path = [14]\n   current = 14\n   while current != 4:\n       for neighbor in graph[current]:\n           if neighbor in visited and distances[neighbor] == distances[current] - 1:\n               path.append(neighbor)\n               current = neighbor\n               break\n\n   path.reverse()\n   ```\n\nThe shortest path from room 4 to room 14 is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 4, 1, 7, 2, 4, 14\n```"
