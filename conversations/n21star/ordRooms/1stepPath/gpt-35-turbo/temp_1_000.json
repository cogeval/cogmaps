Starting from room 1, we can keep track of the shortest distance to each room and the previous room in the shortest path. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance to all rooms to infinity except room 1, which has a distance of 0. Set the previous room of all rooms to undefined.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms containing all rooms.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty:\n   a. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance as the current room.\n   b. For each neighbor of the current room:\n      i. Calculate the tentative distance from room 1 to the neighbor through the current room. This is the distance to the current room plus the distance from the current room to the neighbor.\n      ii. If the tentative distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and previous room.\n   c. Remove the current room from the set of unvisited rooms.\n4. Once we have visited all rooms, we can construct the shortest path from room 1 to room 4 by following the previous rooms from room 4 back to room 1.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 4 is:\n\n1, 2, 4\n\nSo the answer is: Answer: 1, 2, 4"
