The function works by starting at the starting room and then recursively exploring all of the connected rooms. The function keeps track of the rooms that it has already visited so that it does not explore the same room twice. The function returns the list of room numbers when it reaches the ending room.\n\nIn this case, the function returns a list of the room numbers 1, 2, and 4. This means that the shortest path from room 1 to room 4 is to go from room 1 to room 2 and then to room 4."
