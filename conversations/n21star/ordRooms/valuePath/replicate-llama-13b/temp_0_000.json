The shortest paths have some rules based on this information: the list is only collected from each in descending you want an optional first the chests and optional last one from and back then you want one at the room 21 is optional\n  Question - the rules can list multiple room numbers each reward will only one will get reward the question is to calculate each. To have no extra moves\nHint for all this I would make each chest collected only after chest, rooms do list. 4.
