Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Thus, we should know that the data is on the rooms. Let's assume that the data is in rooms because it makes a sense based on the challenge title if it were the integers. But it would be better if the rooms were integers in each of the challenge's instructions.\nSecond, it wants us to take a list of integers , starting of the number that is connected to room 1 and going to where we'll be having our final answer.\nIn my case, is an array of 21 integers, with 21 numbers.\nThe integers go from 1 to 21.\nI've got my answer because I understood how to find a shortest path and this is what I did with my solution.\nBesik on Aug 10, 2017 - 10:18:26 am UTC It's hard to understand :)\nWhy did you have to find two chests? Why aren't there 21 integers? I couldn't understand how to get that answer.\nMy first thing that I have done is written a code that does not work at all.\nMy second thing is written a code that shows me 20 numbers in the answer, why 20?
