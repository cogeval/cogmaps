Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

This path has a total length of 4 rooms and a total reward of **60**.\n\nHere are the steps involved in finding this path:\n\n1. Start at room 1.\n2. Since room 1 is connected to room 4, add room 4 to the path.\n3. Since room 4 is connected to room 14, add room 14 to the path.\n4. Since room 14 is connected to room 10, add room 10 to the path.\n\nThe final path is 1, 4, 14, 10. This path has a total length of 4 rooms and a total reward of **60**.\n\nThe reward of 50 in room 20 is greater than the reward of 10 in room 10, but the path to room 20 is longer. The optimal path is to collect the reward from room 10, which is closer and has a higher reward.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```python\nAnswer: 1, 4, 14, 10\n```"
