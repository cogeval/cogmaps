Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. The algorithm will find the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms in the house, and we will keep track of the maximum reward along each path. We can then select the path with the highest reward.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n3. For each room adjacent to the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the tentative distance to the current room and the distance between the current room and the adjacent room. If this distance is less than the current tentative distance for the adjacent room, update the tentative distance for the adjacent room.\n\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms, stop.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the destination room (room 20 or room 10) is reached.\n\n7. Backtrack from the destination room to room 1, selecting the path with the highest reward (i.e., the path that passes through the chest with the highest reward).\n\nHere is the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
