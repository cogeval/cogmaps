Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Create a table with three columns: \"Room\", \"Distance\", and \"Reward\". For each room, initialize the \"Distance\" column to infinity and the \"Reward\" column to 0, except for rooms 10 and 20 which have rewards of 10 and 50 respectively. Mark room 1 as visited.\n\n2. For each room connected to room 1 (i.e., rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), update their distance and reward values in the table as follows:\n   - If the distance from room 1 to the current room is less than the current value in the \"Distance\" column, update it with the new distance.\n   - If the reward in the current room is greater than the current value in the \"Reward\" column, update it with the new reward.\n\n3. Among the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest distance and mark it as visited. Repeat step 2 for the newly visited room, updating the distance and reward values of its neighbors.\n\n4. Continue selecting the unvisited room with the smallest distance and updating the table until room 20 is visited.\n\n5. Trace back the path with the highest reward from room 20 to room 1 using the table. This will be the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nThe answer to the question is: \"Answer: 1, 7, 5, 16, 20\". This path has a total distance of 7 and a total reward of 50."
