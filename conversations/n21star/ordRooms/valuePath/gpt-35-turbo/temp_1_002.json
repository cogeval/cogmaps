Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will start by assigning a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except for room 1, which will have a tentative distance of 0. We will also create a set of unvisited rooms, which initially will contain all rooms.\n\nThen, we will loop through the unvisited rooms, selecting the one with the smallest tentative distance and marking it as visited. For each of its neighbors that are still unvisited, we will calculate a tentative distance as the sum of the current room's tentative distance and the weight of the edge between the current room and its neighbor. If this tentative distance is smaller than the neighbor's current tentative distance, we will update it. We will repeat this process until we visit all rooms or until there are no more unvisited rooms.\n\nOnce we have calculated the tentative distances for all rooms, we will select the room with the highest reward that we can reach from room 1 with the shortest path. To do this, we will loop through all rooms and select the one that has the highest reward and is reachable from room 1 with the shortest path. We will follow the edges in reverse order, starting from the selected room and going back to room 1, to obtain the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nThe tentative distances for each room are:\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 2\nRoom 4: 2\nRoom 5: 2\nRoom 6: 1\nRoom 7: 2\nRoom 8: 4\nRoom 9: 4\nRoom 10: 6\nRoom 11: 5\nRoom 12: Infinity\nRoom 13: 5\nRoom 14: Infinity\nRoom 15: 7\nRoom 16: 4\nRoom 17: 6\nRoom 18: Infinity\nRoom 19: Infinity\nRoom 20: 8\nRoom 21: Infinity\n\nThe highest reward we can obtain from room 1 with the shortest path is 50, from room 20. The shortest path from room 1 to room 20 that yields the most reward is: 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 13, 17, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 13, 17, 20."
