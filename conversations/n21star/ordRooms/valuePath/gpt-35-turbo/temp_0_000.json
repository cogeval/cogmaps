Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Then, we can choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following shortest paths and rewards:\n\n- Room 1: reward 0\n- Room 2: reward 0\n- Room 3: reward 0\n- Room 4: reward 0\n- Room 5: reward 0\n- Room 6: reward 0\n- Room 7: reward 0\n- Room 8: reward 0\n- Room 9: reward 0\n- Room 10: reward 10 (path: 1-7-2-4-8-9-10)\n- Room 11: reward 0\n- Room 12: reward 0\n- Room 13: reward 0\n- Room 14: reward 0\n- Room 15: reward 0\n- Room 16: reward 0\n- Room 17: reward 0\n- Room 18: reward 0\n- Room 19: reward 0\n- Room 20: reward 50 (path: 1-7-2-16-15-20)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1-7-2-16-15-20.\n\nAnswer: 1,7,2,16,15,20"
