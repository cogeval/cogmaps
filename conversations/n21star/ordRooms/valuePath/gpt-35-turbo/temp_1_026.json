Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16.

Room 11 is connected to rooms 13. Room 20 is connected to rooms 15, 16, and 17. Room 2 is connected to room 4. Room 13 is connected to room 17. Room 17 is connected to rooms 15. Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by initializing the distance of each room from room 1 as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0. We also keep track of the reward in each room.\n\nThen, we consider all rooms connected to room 1 (i.e., rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and update their distance and reward values. Specifically, room 2 has a distance of 1 and no reward, room 3 has a distance of 1 and no reward, room 4 has a distance of 1 and no reward, room 5 has a distance of 1 and no reward, room 6 has a distance of 1 and no reward, and room 7 has a distance of 1 and no reward.\n\nNext, we select the room with the shortest distance from room 1, which is room 2. We consider all rooms connected to room 2 (i.e., rooms 4 and 7) and update their distance and reward values. Specifically, room 4 has a distance of 2 and no reward, and room 7 has a distance of 2 and no reward.\n\nWe continue this process, selecting the room with the shortest distance from room 1 that has not been visited yet and updating the distance and reward values of its connected rooms, until we reach room 20 or room 10. We can reach both rooms with a distance of 4, but since the reward in room 20 is higher, we choose to end our search there.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 6, 5, 16, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 6, 5, 16, 20."
