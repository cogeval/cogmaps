Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.
