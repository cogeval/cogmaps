The numbers outside the curly brackets represent the current shortest distance from room 1 to that room.\n\nNext, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Set the distance of all rooms to infinity except for room 1, which is 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms and add all rooms to it.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Find the room in the set with the smallest distance and remove it from the set.\n   b. For each connected room, calculate the total distance to that room by adding the current room's distance to the reward of the connection. If this total distance is less than the current shortest distance to that room, update the shortest distance.\n4.
