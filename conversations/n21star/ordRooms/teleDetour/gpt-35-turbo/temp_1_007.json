Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from room 1, the algorithm would explore all possible paths to room 20 or 10 and calculate the total reward for each path. Then, it would select the path with the highest reward and shortest length. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 vertices representing the rooms and their connections. Each vertex will have a weight representing the reward in that room, except for room 1 which has a weight of 0.\n2. Initialize an array of distances from room 1 to all other rooms with infinity, except for room 1 which has a distance of 0. Also, initialize an empty array of visited vertices.\n3. While there are unvisited vertices, select the vertex with the smallest distance from room 1. This will be room 1 itself at the first iteration.\n4. For each neighbor of the selected vertex that has not been visited, calculate its distance from room 1 as the sum of the distance from the selected vertex and the weight of the edge connecting them. If this distance is smaller than the current distance stored in the array, update the array with the new distance.\n5. Mark the selected vertex as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all vertices have been visited.\n7. Compare the distances to room 20 and room 10. Whichever room has the smaller distance and a non-zero weight is the one to go to.\n8. Trace back the path from the winning room to room 1 using the array of distances. This will give us the shortest path with the highest reward.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 20"
