Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we create a graph with each room as a node and the connections between them as edges with weights equal to the reward in the chest (if any). Then, we can run Dijkstra's algorithm with room 1 as the starting node and find the shortest path to any of the two reward chests. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 nodes representing each room, and the connections between them as edges with weights equal to the reward in the chest (if any).\n2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm with room 1 as the starting node, and compute the shortest path to each of the reward chests (room 10 and room 20).\n3. Compare the rewards of the two paths and choose the one with the highest reward.\n4.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 nodes representing each room, and the connections between them as edges with weights equal to the reward in the chest (if any). However, we remove the edge between room 5 and room 16 as the door is locked.\n2. Add a new node representing the teleportation portal in room 14, and connect it to the neighboring rooms of room 15.\n3. Connect room 14 to room 4 and room 10 to account for the teleportation option.\n4. Run Dijkstra's algorithm with room 1 as the starting node, and compute the shortest path to each of the reward chests (room 10 and room 20).\n5.
