Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

We can use it to get to room 15 and then choose a neighboring room that allows us to get closer to the chests in rooms 10 and 20.\n\nThere are two neighboring rooms of room 15 that can get us closer to the chests:\n\n- Room 16 (locked door from room 5): we can't use this room, since the door is locked.\n- Room 17: by going through room 17, we can get to room 20, which has the highest reward.\n\nTherefore, the path we should take is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 14 -> 15 -> 17 -> 20\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 15, 17, 20"
