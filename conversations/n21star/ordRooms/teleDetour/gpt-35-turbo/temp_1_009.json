Once we reach room 20 or 10, we will stop the algorithm and output the path to the chest with the maximum reward.\n\nHere are the steps of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distances and rewards for all nodes to infinity, except for room 1 which has distance 0 and reward 0.\n\n2. While there are unvisited nodes:\n   a. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance, call it \"current\".\n   b. For each neighbor of the current node:\n      i. Calculate the distance from the starting node to the neighbor through the current node.\n      ii.

Therefore, we will modify the graph to reflect this change.\n\nUsing the modified graph, we will apply the same Dijkstra's algorithm as before, but this time we will consider the teleportation portal in room 14. Instead of calculating the distance from room 14 to each neighbor of room 15, we will calculate the distance from room 14 to each neighbor of room 15 plus the distance from the starting node (room 1) to room 14. This is because we need to take into account the cost of teleporting to room 14.\n\nHere are the steps of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distances and rewards for all nodes to infinity, except for room 1 which has distance 0 and reward 0.\n\n2. While there are unvisited nodes:\n   a. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance, call it \"current\".\n   b. For each neighbor of the current node:\n      i. If the neighbor is room 15, calculate the distance and reward of teleporting to a neighboring room of room 15 through room 14 and compare it to the distance and reward of going directly to room 15. If the teleportation is better, update the distance and reward for the neighbor.\n      ii. If the neighbor is not room 15, calculate the distance from the starting node to the neighbor through the current node. If the calculated distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and reward for the neighbor.\n   c. Mark the current node as visited.\n\n3.
