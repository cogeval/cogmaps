Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will start by assigning a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms. We will also create a set of unvisited rooms containing all rooms except room 1. \n\nThen, we will loop through the unvisited rooms and for each room, we will calculate the tentative distance to that room by adding the distance to the current room plus the reward of the chest in that room (if there is one). If the tentative distance is less than the current distance to that room, we will update the distance. We will also keep track of the previous room that leads to the current room.\n\nAfter visiting all the unvisited rooms, we will select the room with the highest reward and backtrack from that room to room 1 using the previous room information we collected earlier.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20. The total reward collected is 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20."

We will start by checking if there is a path from room 1 to room 20 without passing through room 5 and room 16. We can do this by running Dijkstra's algorithm as before but excluding the edges that connect room 5 to room 16.\n\nIf there is no such path, we need to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 14 and then teleport to a neighboring room of room 15 that is on the path to room 20. To do this, we will modify Dijkstra's algorithm to stop when we reach room 14 and then check the neighboring rooms of room 15 to see which one is on the path to room 20. We will then teleport to that room and continue the path to room 20 as before.\n\nAfter reaching room 20, we will backtrack to room 1 to find the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 15, 17, 13, 11, 10, 20.
