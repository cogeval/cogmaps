Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16. Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to all other rooms and keep track of the maximum reward found along each path. Then, we can choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10.\n\nThe path goes from room 1 to room 2, then to room 4, where we find a chest with a reward of 50. We continue to room 14, which is connected to room 10, where we find a chest with a reward of 10. This path has a total reward of 50 + 10 = 60, which is the highest possible reward we can get starting from room 1.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10."
