Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Since we can use the teleportation portal in room 14 to reach any neighboring room of room 15, we can take advantage of this to find a new shortest path.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm again, we get the following shortest paths and rewards:\n\n- Room 1: reward 0\n- Room 2: reward 0\n- Room 3: reward 0\n- Room 4: reward 0\n- Room 5: reward 0\n- Room 6: reward 0\n- Room 7: reward 0\n- Room 8: reward 0\n- Room 9: reward 0\n- Room 10: reward 10 (1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10)\n- Room 11: reward 0\n- Room 12: reward 0\n- Room 13: reward 0\n- Room 14: reward 0\n- Room 15: reward 0\n- Room 16: reward 0\n- Room 17: reward 0\n- Room 18: reward 0\n- Room 19: reward 0\n- Room 20: reward 50 (1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 16 -> 15 -> 20)\n- Room 21: reward 0\n\nTo find the new shortest path, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Take the shortest path from room 1 to room 14: 1, 7, 2, 4, 14.\n2. From room 14, teleport to room 15's neighboring room that is closest to room 20. In this case, we can teleport to room 16.\n3. Take the shortest path from room 16 to room 20: 16, 15, 20.\n\nTherefore, the new shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 2, 4, 14, 16, 15, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 4, 14, 16, 15, 20"
