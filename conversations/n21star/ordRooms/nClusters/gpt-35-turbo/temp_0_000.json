We can represent each room as a node and the connections between the rooms as edges. Then, we can use a graph traversal algorithm to find the clusters.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can create the following graph:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7\n \\                            /\n  \\                          /\n   12 -- 13 -- 14 -- 8 -- 9 -- 10 -- 11\n                                        \\\n                                         13 -- 17 -- 15 -- 16 -- 18 -- 19 -- 20 -- 21\n```\n\nUsing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, we can traverse the graph and find the clusters. We start with a node and explore all its neighbors recursively. If a neighbor has already been visited, we skip it. If a neighbor has not been visited, we add it to the current cluster and explore its neighbors recursively. We continue this process until we have visited all the nodes in the graph.\n\nAfter applying the DFS algorithm, we can see that there are 5 densely-connected room clusters in the house:\n\n```\nCluster 1: Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nCluster 2: Rooms 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14\nCluster 3: Rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21\nCluster 4: Room 12\nCluster 5: Room 13 (connected to room 17 only)\n```\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
