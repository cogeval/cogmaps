A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

            "content": "To find the densely-connected room clusters in this house, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent each room as a node and the connections between rooms as edges. Then, we can use a graph algorithm to find the clusters of nodes that are densely connected.\n\nFirst, we can create an adjacency matrix to represent the connections between rooms. The matrix would be a 21x21 matrix, where each row and column represents a room and the values in the matrix represent the connections between rooms. For example, the value in row 1 and column 2 would be 1, since room 1 is connected to room 2.\n\nNext, we can use a graph algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the densely-connected clusters of rooms. We can start with a node and traverse the graph to find all the nodes that are connected to it. If we find a node that is already in a cluster, we add it to that cluster. If we find a node that is not in a cluster, we create a new cluster and add it to that cluster. We continue this process until we have traversed all the nodes in the graph.\n\nUsing this approach, we can find that there are 6 densely-connected room clusters in this house.\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
