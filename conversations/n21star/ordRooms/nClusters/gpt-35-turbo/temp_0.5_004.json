Each room can be considered as a node in the graph, and the connections between the rooms can be considered as edges. \n\nWe can start by identifying the clusters of rooms that are densely connected to each other. We can do this by performing a depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithm on the graph, starting from each room that has not been visited yet. \n\nAfter performing the search, we can count the number of clusters that have a minimum of 2 rooms connected to each other. \n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters."
