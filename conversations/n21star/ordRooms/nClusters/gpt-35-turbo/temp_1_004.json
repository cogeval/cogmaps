One approach is to use the Depth-First Search algorithm to traverse the rooms and identify the clusters. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list of clusters.\n2. For each unvisited room, perform a Depth-First Search to find all the rooms that are connected to it. If the number of connected rooms is 1 (i.e., it is not part of a cluster), mark it as visited and move on to the next unvisited room.\n3. If the number of connected rooms is greater than 1, add them to a new cluster and mark them as visited. Then, perform a Depth-First Search on each unvisited room in the cluster to find all the rooms that are connected to it. Add these rooms to the same cluster and mark them as visited. Repeat until all connected rooms have been added to the cluster.\n4. Add the completed cluster to the list of clusters.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all rooms have been visited.\n\nUsing this approach, we can identify 9 densely-connected room clusters in the house. \n\nAnswer: there are 9 clusters"
