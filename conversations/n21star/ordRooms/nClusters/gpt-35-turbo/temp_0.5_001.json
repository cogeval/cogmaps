Room 11 is connected to rooms 13. Room 20 is connected to rooms 15, 16, and 17. Room 2 is connected to room 4. Room 13 is connected to room 17. Room 17 is connected to rooms 15.

A densely-connected cluster is a group of rooms that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 rooms."

We can represent each room as a node in the graph and the connections between the rooms as edges. Then, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the clusters.\n\nStarting with room 1, we can perform a DFS and mark all the connected nodes. We can repeat this process for all unmarked nodes until all the nodes are marked. The number of DFS required to mark all the nodes is equal to the number of densely-connected clusters in the house.\n\nPerforming this algorithm, we find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in the house: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, {8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14}, {15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}, and {12}. \n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
