For example, in cluster 1, room 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, and 4. Room 2 is connected to rooms 1, 3, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 1, 2, and 4. Room 4 is connected to rooms 1, 2, and 5.

Room 2 is not connected to any room in cluster 3. Room 3 is not connected to any room in cluster 4.\n\nDo you have any other questions?"
