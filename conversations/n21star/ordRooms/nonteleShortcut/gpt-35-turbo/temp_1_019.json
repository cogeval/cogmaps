Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. In this case, we will consider the rewards in each room as the weights of the edges.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can first explore rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Among these rooms, room 5 has a connection to room 16, which leads to the chest with a reward of 50. So we should explore room 5.\n\nFrom room 5, we can explore room 16, which leads to the chest with a reward of 50. However, since we can only collect the reward once, we should compare the rewards of room 10 and room 20. We can explore room 2 from room 5, which leads to room 4, which leads to room 14, which leads to room 10. Room 10 has a chest with a reward of 10, which is less than the reward of room 20. Alternatively, we can explore room 15 from room 16, which leads to room 20. Room 20 has a chest with a reward of 50, which is greater than the reward of room 10. Therefore, we should explore room 20.\n\nFrom room 20, we can explore room 15, which leads to room 17, which leads to room 13, which leads to room 11, which leads to room 10. However, we have already determined that room 10 has a lower reward than room 20, so we should not explore that path. Instead, we can explore room 18 from room 20, which leads to room 17, which leads to room 13. Room 13 has a connection to room 17, which leads to room 15, which leads to room 16, which leads to room 5, which leads to room 1. This is the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nTherefore, the order of the rooms starting from room 1 in the shortest path that yields the most reward is: 1, 5, 16, 20, 18, 17, 13, 11. \n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 16, 20, 18, 17, 13, 11"
