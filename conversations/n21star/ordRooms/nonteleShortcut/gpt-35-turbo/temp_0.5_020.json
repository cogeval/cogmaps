We will also keep track of the previous room for each room, which will help us reconstruct the shortest path later.\n\nStarting from room 1, we can reach rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, but none of them have any rewards. Therefore, we will explore room 6 next, which can lead us to room 2, which in turn can lead us to room 4. Room 4 has a connection to room 14, which has a chest with a reward of 10. We can update the tentative distance of room 14 to 10 and set its previous room to be room 4.\n\nNext, we will explore room 7, which can lead us to room 4 as well. However, room 4 already has a tentative distance of 10, so we don't need to update it. We will then explore room 2, which can lead us to room 13, which has a chest with a reward of 50.
