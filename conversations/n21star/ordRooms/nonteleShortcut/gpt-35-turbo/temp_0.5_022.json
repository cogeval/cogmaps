We will consider the chests in rooms 10 and 20 as the destinations and the rewards as the weights of the edges.\n\n1. Initialize the starting node (room 1) with distance 0 and all other nodes with distance infinity.\n2. Visit all the neighbors of the starting node (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and update their distances to the rewards of the edges connecting them (0 for now, since there are no rewards on these edges).\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance (room 2) and visit its neighbors (rooms 4, 5, 7, and 16). Update their distances to the rewards of the edges connecting them (0 for now, since there are no rewards on these edges).\n4. Select the node with the smallest distance (room 4) and visit its neighbors (rooms 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 14).
