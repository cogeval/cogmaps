Starting from room 4, we will find the shortest paths to all other rooms and calculate the rewards along each path. Then, we will select the path with the highest total reward. \n\nUsing the given connections between rooms and the reward of 10 for room 13, the rewards for moving from one room to another are as follows:\n- Rooms connected directly to 4: Room 2 (0 reward), Room 5 (0 reward), and Room 7 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 2: Room 4 (0 reward), Room 3 (0 reward), Room 7 (0 reward), and Room 6 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 3: Room 2 (0 reward), Room 4 (0 reward), Room 5 (0 reward), Room 7 (0 reward), and Room 13 (10 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 5: Room 2 (0 reward), Room 4 (0 reward), Room 7 (0 reward), Room 6 (0 reward), and Room 16 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 7: Room 2 (0 reward), Room 4 (0 reward), Room 3 (0 reward), Room 5 (0 reward), and Room 6 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 13: Room 11 (0 reward), Room 17 (0 reward), and Room 3 (10 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 11: Room 10 (0 reward), Room 9 (0 reward), and Room 13 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 10: Room 11 (0 reward), Room 8 (0 reward), Room 9 (0 reward), and Room 13 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 8: Room 9 (0 reward), Room 11 (0 reward), and Room 13 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 9: Room 8 (0 reward), Room 10 (0 reward), Room 11 (0 reward), and Room 13 (0 reward)\n- Rooms connected to Room 14: Room 4 (0 reward), Room 8 (0 reward), Room 9 (0 reward), Room 10 (0 reward), Room 11 (0 reward), and Room 13 (10 reward)\n\nUsing this information, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths and rewards from Room 4 to Room 13 via all possible routes. The possible routes from Room 4 to Room 13 are:\n- Room 4 \u2192 Room 2 \u2192 Room 3 \u2192 Room 13 (10 reward)\n- Room 4 \u2192 Room 7 \u2192 Room 3 \u2192 Room 13 (10 reward)\n- Room 4 \u2192 Room 7 \u2192 Room 2 \u2192 Room 3 \u2192 Room 13 (10 reward)\n- Room 4 \u2192 Room 5 \u2192 Room 16 \u2192 Room 15 \u2192 Room 17 \u2192 Room 13 (0 reward)\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward from Room 4 to Room 13 is Room 4 \u2192 Room 2 \u2192 Room 3 \u2192 Room 13, with a total reward of 10. \n\nAnswer: 4, 2, 3, 13"
