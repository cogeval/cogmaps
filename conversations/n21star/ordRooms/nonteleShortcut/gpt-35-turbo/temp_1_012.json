Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest distance to each room that contains a chest and choose the one with the highest reward.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. We also create an empty set of visited rooms and a dictionary to keep track of the previous room in the shortest path.\n\n2. We select the room with the smallest distance that hasn't been visited yet. For the first iteration, this is room 1.\n\n3. We update the distances of all neighboring rooms that haven't been visited yet. The new distance is the sum of the current distance and the weight of the edge (which is 1 for adjacent rooms). We also update the previous room in the dictionary.\n\n4. We mark the current room as visited and repeat step 2 until we have visited all rooms that contain a chest.\n\n5. We select the room with the highest reward and use the dictionary to backtrack to room 1 and list the rooms in order.\n\nThe distances and previous rooms are:\n\nRoom 10: distance 3, previous room 4\nRoom 20: distance 4, previous room 15\nRoom 13: distance 6, previous room 11\nRoom 17: distance 6, previous room 15\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n1, 4, 10\n\nAnswer: 1, 4, 10"
