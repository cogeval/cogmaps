Here, the nodes are the rooms and the edges are the connections between the rooms. The edge weights are the rewards in the chests, and we will use the following algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to each room as infinity, except for room 1 which is 0.\n2. Initialize an empty set of visited nodes.\n3. Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) and add room 1 to it with distance 0.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the room with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   b. If this room is the target room (room 10 or room 20), return the path to it.\n   c. If this room has not been visited yet:\n      i. Mark it as visited.\n      ii. For each neighbor of this room that has not been visited, calculate the distance to that neighbor by adding the edge weight to the distance of this room.\n      iii. If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance to that neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue with the new distance.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the following shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward:\n\n1, 7, 4, 10\n\nThe total reward collected is 10."
