I was just practicing this skill to get better at answering questions\nSo, I understand. What's the question?\nHow do I calculate a square root?\nI don't understand the question. What do you mean by square root?\nI don't get that, Alexa. Square root? I have no idea what that means. What's the first equation?\n4*4 = 16. Can you see why? Does this look familiar? It's a 4^2. It's the squared version of a 4. The squared version of 4 is 16...because when it's squared, it makes more 4's, so it's 16. Now, squaring a square is going again to square by 1, what is that, 2 times 2, so it's (2^2) = 4. Now, in terms of a square root, what we need to do is to actually...to think of the positive numbers as a rectangle that we need to fold into a square. So, look at 7^2. What's 7 squared? So, 7*7 = 49, which is quite big. So, is it... is it a 7 by 7? It is not. So, you need to fold, so think of 4 by 4 and get 16. What's 4 raised to the power of 2? Right? So, in terms of a square root, 4^2 is 16.\nOkay, but I don't have 4 square. I have... I don't know how to do that\nLook at the 4^2, which is 16, and think of it as a rectangle. Put it all along one side and try to squish it into a square. And that will help you to see how to do... to do this squaring.\nBut how can I take... but I don't know how to do that\nLook at 4^2 as a rectangle. It should make sense."
