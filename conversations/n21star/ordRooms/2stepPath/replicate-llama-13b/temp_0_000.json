We can easily split this information according to:\na: starting with a-1, a-2, a-3, b-1, b-2, b-3, ...\nd: ending with d-1, d-2, ...\nb: b-1 connected to b-2, b-3, ...\nc: c-1 connected to c-2, c-3, ...\nYou will observe that this process is applicable to any room.\nFor the 'Answer:' regular expression I am using, for example, '21, 15, 6, 4, 5'. This regular expression helps me to filter 15 and 4 because of their presence between 2 and 1. And for 6, it helps me to filter out '', 1, 2, 9, 3'. For 'Answer:', we have to remove the double quote so that ' 21, 15, 6, 4, 5' can be identified as one entity. That would be:\n'  21, 15, 6, 4, 5'\nNow we can easily identify the digits after the double quotes. So that:\n'    21, 15, 6, 4, 5'\nNext, we have to remove digits without using '    '. The following string demonstrates this:\n' [12, 29] * [2, 3]'\nSo that I would have this:\n' [12] * [2]'\nNow we can finally remove unwanted numbers and have:\n' * [2]'\nFinally, we have to replace double quotes and split with ,.\nuser_answer: [12]*, [2]*\nYour answer is still incorrect.
