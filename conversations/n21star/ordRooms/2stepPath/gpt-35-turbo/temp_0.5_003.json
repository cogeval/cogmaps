            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 16, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 2 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighboring room will be the distance from the initial room to the current room, plus the distance between the current room and the neighboring room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the lower one. For example, if the current room is room 2 and its neighboring room is room 4, the tentative distance to room 4 would be 1 (the distance from room 2 to room 4).\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighboring rooms of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. Go back to step 3.\n\nWe repeat step 3-5 until we have visited all rooms or until the destination room (room 16) has been visited.\n\nHere are the tentative distances for each room after completing the algorithm:\n\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 4: 1\nRoom 5: 1\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 16: 2\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 2 to room 16 is:\n\n2, 5, 16\n\nAnswer: 2, 5, 16"
