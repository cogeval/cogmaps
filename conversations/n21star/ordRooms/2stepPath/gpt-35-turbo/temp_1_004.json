            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 14, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Assign to every room a tentative distance value: set it to zero for room 3 and to infinity for all other rooms. Set the initial visited nodes to an empty set.\n\n2. Set the current room to room 3 and the initial value of the distance to zero.\n\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the starting point (room 3) to the neighbor, through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if room 4 is a neighbor of room 3, the distance from room 3 to room 4 is 1, and the current assigned distance to room 4 is infinity, then we would assign 1 as the new tentative distance to room 4.\n\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new \"current room\" then go back to step 3.\n\n6. Continue this process until the destination room (room 14) has been visited. The tentative distance to room 14 is the shortest distance from room 3.\n\nHere is the shortest path from room 3 to room 14, including the rooms in order: \n\nAnswer: 3, 4, 14"
