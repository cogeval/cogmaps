Starting from room 5, we can explore all possible paths to room 4 and choose the shortest one. One such algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can assign a tentative distance to each room, initially setting it to infinity for all rooms except for room 5, which is set to 0. We then visit each adjacent room to room 5 and update their tentative distances if they can be reached with a shorter path. We continue exploring all adjacent rooms until we reach room 4 or have visited all reachable rooms. The final shortest path will be the list of rooms from room 5 to room 4 in order.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 5 to room 4 is: \n\nAnswer: 5, 7, 4"
