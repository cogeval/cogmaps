            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 4 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start at room 4 and consider all its adjacent rooms (2, 5, 7, 14). We then calculate the distance to each of those rooms, which are all 1. We mark room 4 as visited and add its adjacent rooms to a priority queue, ordered by distance.\n\nNext, we extract the room with the shortest distance from the priority queue, which is room 2. We then consider its adjacent rooms (4 and 7) and update their distances if they can be improved through room 2. In this case, we can improve our distance to room 7 to 2 (through room 2) and mark room 2 as visited. We add room 7 to the priority queue.\n\nWe repeat the above steps, extracting the next closest unvisited room from the priority queue, which is room 7. We update the distance to room 8, which is now 3, since we can get to room 8 from room 7. We mark room 7 as visited and add its adjacent rooms to the priority queue (2 and 4).\n\nNext, we extract room 4 from the priority queue and update its distance to 2 (through room 7). We mark room 4 as visited and add its adjacent rooms to the priority queue (2 and 5).\n\nWe then extract room 2 from the priority queue, but its distance has not improved, so we skip it. We extract room 5 from the priority queue and update its distance to 3 (through room 4). We mark room 5 as visited and add its adjacent room to the priority queue (6).\n\nWe extract room 6 from the priority queue and update its distance to 4 (through room 5). We mark room 6 as visited and add its adjacent room to the priority queue (7).\n\nFinally, we extract room 8 from the priority queue, which has the shortest distance of 3. Therefore, the shortest path from room 4 to room 8 is: 4, 7, 8.\n\nAnswer: 4, 7, 8."
