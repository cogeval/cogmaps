Assign a tentative distance of 0 to the starting room (room 4) and infinity to all other rooms.\n3. Set the starting room as the current room.\n4. For the current room, consider all connected rooms that are unvisited. For each of those rooms, calculate the tentative distance from the starting room to that room (which is the distance to the current room plus the distance from the current room to that room).\n5. If the tentative distance is less than the current distance assigned to that room, update the distance to the tentative distance.\n6. Mark the current room as visited.\n7. If the destination room (room 11) has been visited, stop. The shortest path has been found.\n8. Otherwise, select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the current room. Go back to step 4.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can determine that the shortest path from room 4 to room 11 is:\n4, 7, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 11\n\nAnswer: 4, 7, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 11"
