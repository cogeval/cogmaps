            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 16 to room 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 16 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms unvisited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor through the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 16 and its neighbor is room 15, the tentative distance to room 15 is 1 (since they are connected directly), and we compare it to the current assigned value (infinity). Since 1 is smaller than infinity, we assign 1 as the new tentative distance to room 15.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room. If there is no such room, the algorithm has finished.\n6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the destination room (room 2) has been visited. The shortest path to room 2 will be the sequence of rooms that were visited, in reverse order.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get the shortest path from room 16 to room 2 as follows:\n\n16, 15, 20, 18, 17, 13, 8, 4, 2\n\nAnswer: 16, 15, 20, 18, 17, 13, 8, 4, 2"
