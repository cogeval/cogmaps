For each of the rooms connected to the newly visited room (room 2), update their distances in the table. The new distance is the distance from room 5 to room 2, plus the distance from room 2 to the connected room, plus the distance from the connected room to room 20. If this new distance is shorter than the current distance in the table, update the table.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited? |\n|------|----------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |          |\n| 2    | 1        |    Yes   |\n| 3    | 1        |    Yes   |\n| 4    | 1        |    Yes   |\n| 5    | 0        |    Yes   |\n| 6    | \u221e        |          |\n| 7    | 1        |    Yes   |\n| 8    | 2        |          |\n| 9    | 2        |          |\n| 10   | 2        |          |\n| 11   | 2        |          |\n| 12   | \u221e        |          |\n| 13   | 3        |          |\n| 14   | 2        |          |\n| 15   | 3        |          |\n| 16   | 2        |    Yes   |\n| 17   | 4        |          |\n| 18   | 4        |          |\n| 19   | 3        |          |\n| 20   | 4        |          |\n| 21   | \u221e        |          |\n\n6.
