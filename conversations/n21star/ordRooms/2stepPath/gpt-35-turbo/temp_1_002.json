Initialize the starting room (room 2) with a distance of 0, and all other rooms with a distance of infinity.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n3. Set the starting room (room 2) as the current room.\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. For example, room 2 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 6, 7, and 16.\n5. When we consider each neighbor, we will add the weight of the edge between the current room and the neighbor. In this case, all edges have a weight of 1 since they are just doorways connecting adjacent rooms.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is closest to the starting room (room 2). In this case, room 4 is the closest neighbor to room 2.\n7. Set the current room to be this closest neighbor (room 4).\n8. Mark the current room as visited.\n9. Repeat steps 4-8 for each neighbor of the current room (room 4), calculating and updating tentative distances as necessary.\n10. Stop when the destination room (room 14) has been visited.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 14 is: Answer: 2,4,14"
