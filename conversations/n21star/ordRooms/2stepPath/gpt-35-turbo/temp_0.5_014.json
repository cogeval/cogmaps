Initially, set the distance to infinity, except for room 5, which has distance 0. Also, create a set of unvisited rooms, which includes all the rooms.\n\n| Room | Distance | Visited? |\n|------|----------|----------|\n| 1    | \u221e        |          |\n| 2    | \u221e        |          |\n| 3    | \u221e        |          |\n| 4    | \u221e        |          |\n| 5    | 0        |          |\n| 6    | \u221e        |          |\n| 7    | \u221e        |          |\n| 8    | \u221e        |          |\n| 9    | \u221e        |          |\n| 10   | \u221e        |          |\n| 11   | \u221e        |          |\n| 12   | \u221e        |          |\n| 13   | \u221e        |          |\n| 14   | \u221e        |          |\n| 15   | \u221e        |          |\n| 16   | \u221e        |          |\n| 17   | \u221e        |          |\n| 18   | \u221e        |          |\n| 19   | \u221e        |          |\n| 20   | \u221e        |          |\n| 21   | \u221e        |          |\n\n2.
