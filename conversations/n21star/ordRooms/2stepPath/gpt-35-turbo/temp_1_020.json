Among these, room 4 is directly connected to room 14, so we add room 4 and 14 to our list. \n\nNext, we consider the neighboring rooms of room 4: rooms 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14. We can ignore room 7 since we have already visited it. Among the remaining rooms, room 14 is already in our list and we do not want to create a cycle, so we skip it. Among the remaining rooms, room 8 is the closest to room 4, so we add room 8 to our list.\n\nWe continue this process, considering the neighboring rooms of each new room that we add to our list. We always choose the closest neighboring room that has not already been visited, until we reach room 14. The shortest path from room 7 to room 14 is:\n\nAnswer: 7, 4, 8, 11, 13, 14"
