Start in room 7.\n2. Go to room 4.\n3. Go to room 18.\n\nIn room 18, you will find no chest.\n\nThe total reward for this path is 0.\n\nHere is a visualization of the path:\n\n```\n[7] - 4 - 18\n```\n\nI used the following steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. I created a graph where each room is a node and each connection between rooms is an edge.\n2. I used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 7 to room 18.\n3. I converted the path from the graph into a list of room numbers.\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by repeatedly finding the node with the shortest distance from the starting node that has not yet been visited. The algorithm terminates when the destination node is reached.\n\nHere is the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n```\nfunction dijkstra(graph, start):\n  distances = {}\n  for node in graph.nodes:\n    distances[node] = infinity\n  distances[start] = 0\n  queue = [start]\n  while queue is not empty:\n    node = queue.pop()\n    for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):\n      new_distance = distances[node] + graph.edge_weight(node, neighbor)\n      if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n        distances[neighbor] = new_distance\n        queue.append(neighbor)\n  return distances\n```\n\nIn this case, the graph is the set of rooms in the house and the edges are the connections between rooms. The starting node is room 7 and the destination node is room 18. The algorithm returns a dictionary where the keys are the room numbers and the values are the distances from room 7 to those rooms. The shortest path is then the list of room numbers in the dictionary with the smallest value."
