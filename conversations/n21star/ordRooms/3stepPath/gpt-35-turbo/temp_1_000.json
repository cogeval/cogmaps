Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to Room 2 (Rooms 4 and 7). If we haven't visited them before, add them to the end of the queue.\n5. Take the first room from the queue (Room 3).\n6. Look at all the rooms that are directly connected to Room 3 (Rooms 2, 4, 5, and 7). We've already visited Room 2 and Room 7, so we skip those. If we haven't visited Rooms 4 and 5, add them to the end of the queue.\n7. Take the first room from the queue (Room 4).\n8. Room 4 is directly connected to Room 8, so we're done!
