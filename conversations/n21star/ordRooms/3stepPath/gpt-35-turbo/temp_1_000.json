Check the adjacent rooms to room 7: rooms 2 and 4\n3. Add rooms 2 and 4 to a queue, and mark them as visited\n4. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 2)\n5. Check the adjacent rooms to room 2: rooms 4, 5, 6, and 7\n6. Add rooms 4, 5, 6, and 7 to the queue (if they haven't been visited yet), and mark them as visited\n7. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 4)\n8. Check the adjacent rooms to room 4: rooms 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14\n9. Add rooms 2, 3, 5, and 14 to the queue (if they haven't been visited yet), and mark them as visited\n10. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 5)\n11. Check the adjacent rooms to room 5: rooms 2, 3, 4, 6, and 16\n12. Add room 6 and 16 to the queue (if they haven't been visited yet), and mark them as visited\n13. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 6)\n14. Check the adjacent rooms to room 6: rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 16\n15. Add room 16 to the queue (if it hasn't been visited yet), and mark it as visited\n16. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 16)\n17. Check the adjacent rooms to room 16: rooms 5, 6, 15, 17, and 20\n18. Add room 15 and 18 to the queue (if they haven't been visited yet), and mark them as visited\n19. Dequeue the first room from the queue (room 15)\n20. Check the adjacent rooms to room 15: rooms 16, 17, 18, and 20\n21. Add room 18 to the queue (if it hasn't been visited yet), and mark it as visited\n22.
