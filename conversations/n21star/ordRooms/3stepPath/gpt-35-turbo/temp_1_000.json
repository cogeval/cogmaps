Using the given connections between the rooms, we can represent the house as a graph, where each room is a node and each connection is an edge with a weight of 1. Then, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 7 to room 18:\n\n1. Start at room 7 with a distance of 0.\n2. Visit the adjacent rooms: rooms 2, 4, and 5 with a distance of 1, and room 6 with a distance of 2.\n3. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 4 with a distance of 1.\n4. Visit the adjacent rooms of room 4: rooms 2, 5, 7, and 14 with a distance of 2.\n5. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 2 with a distance of 2.\n6. Visit the adjacent rooms of room 2: rooms 4 and 3 with a distance of 3.\n7. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 3 with a distance of 3.\n8. Visit the adjacent rooms of room 3: rooms 2, 4, 5, and 7 with a distance of 4.\n9. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 5 with a distance of 4.\n10. Visit the adjacent rooms of room 5: rooms 2, 4, 7, 16, and 6 with a distance of 5.\n11. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 16 with a distance of 5.\n12. Visit the adjacent rooms of room 16: rooms 5, 15, 17, 18, and 20 with a distance of 6.\n13. Choose the room with the shortest distance that hasn't been visited yet. In this case, it's room 18 with a distance of 6.\n14. We've reached room 18 with a distance of 6, so the shortest path from room 7 to room 18 is: 7, 4, 2, 3, 5, 16, 18.\n\nAnswer: 7, 4, 2, 3, 5, 16, 18."
