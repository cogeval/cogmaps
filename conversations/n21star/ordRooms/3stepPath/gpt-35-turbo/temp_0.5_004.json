            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 1 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 1 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current: room 1.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance to a neighboring room will be the sum of the current room's distance and the distance between the two rooms (which is 1 in this case).\n4. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the new value if it is less than the current assigned value.\n5. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n6. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited.\n\nHere are the tentative distances for each room after step 1:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: infinity\nRoom 3: infinity\nRoom 4: infinity\nRoom 5: infinity\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: infinity\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: infinity\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\nRoom 21: infinity\n\nAfter applying Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following tentative distances:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 1\nRoom 3: 2\nRoom 4: 2\nRoom 5: 2\nRoom 6: 1\nRoom 7: 1\nRoom 8: 3\nRoom 9: 4\nRoom 10: 5\nRoom 11: 4\nRoom 12: 6\nRoom 13: 5\nRoom 14: 5\nRoom 15: 7\nRoom 16: 3\nRoom 17: 6\nRoom 18: 8\nRoom 19: 9\nRoom 20: 8\nRoom 21: infinity\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 12 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 6, 7, 4, 8, 11, 12"
