Then we check all the rooms that are connected to room 3 (rooms 2, 4, 5, and 7). \n3. We calculate the distance from room 3 to each of these rooms and update their distance values accordingly. The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 2: distance 1\n   - Room 4: distance 1\n   - Room 5: distance 1\n   - Room 7: distance 1\n4. Next, we select the room with the shortest distance from our starting room 3, which is room 2. We mark it as visited. \n5. We then repeat step 3 and update the distance values of all the rooms connected to room 2 (rooms 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 3: distance 2\n   - Room 4: distance 1\n   - Room 5: distance 1\n   - Room 6: distance 2\n   - Room 7: distance 1\n6. We select the room with the shortest distance among the unvisited rooms, which is room 4. We mark it as visited. \n7. We repeat step 3 for all the rooms connected to room 4 (rooms 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14). The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 2: distance 2\n   - Room 3: distance 3\n   - Room 5: distance 2\n   - Room 7: distance 2\n   - Room 8: distance 2\n   - Room 9: distance 2\n   - Room 10: distance 3\n   - Room 14: distance 2\n8. We select the room with the shortest distance among the unvisited rooms, which is room 5. We mark it as visited.\n9. We repeat step 3 for all the rooms connected to room 5 (rooms 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 16). The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 2: distance 3\n   - Room 3: distance 2\n   - Room 4: distance 2\n   - Room 6: distance 3\n   - Room 7: distance 2\n   - Room 16: distance 3\n10. We select the room with the shortest distance among the unvisited rooms, which is room 7. We mark it as visited. \n11. We repeat step 3 for all the rooms connected to room 7 (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, and 16). The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 2: distance 4\n   - Room 3: distance 3\n   - Room 4: distance 2\n   - Room 5: distance 2\n   - Room 16: distance 3\n12. We select the room with the shortest distance among the unvisited rooms, which is room 16. We mark it as visited.\n13. We repeat step 3 for all the rooms connected to room 16 (rooms 5, 15, 17, 18, and 20). The distances are as follows:\n   - Room 5: distance 3\n   - Room 15: distance 4\n   - Room 17: distance 4\n   - Room 18: distance 4\n   - Room 20: distance 4\n14.
