            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 3 to room 12, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to all rooms except for room 3, which has a tentative distance value of infinity. Set the current room to room 3.\n2. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distance values. The tentative distance value for a neighboring room is the sum of the current room's tentative distance value and the distance between the current room and the neighboring room (which is 1, since all rooms are connected by a single hallway).\n3. From the set of tentative distance values, select the room with the smallest value and set it as the new current room.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the destination room (room 12) has been visited. At this point, the shortest path from room 3 to room 12 will be the sequence of rooms that were visited in reverse order, starting from room 12 and following the path of smallest tentative distance values back to room 3.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from room 3 to room 12 is:\n\n3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12"
