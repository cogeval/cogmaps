Mark all other distances as infinity.\n2. Look at all the rooms that room 2 is connected to: rooms 4, 5, 7, and 6. Mark their distances as 1.\n3. Look at all the rooms that those rooms are connected to. For example, room 4 is connected to rooms 3, 5, 7, and 14. The distance to those rooms from room 2 through room 4 is 2. Similarly, room 5 is connected to rooms 3, 4, 7, and 16. The distance to those rooms from room 2 through room 5 is 2. Room 7 is connected to rooms 4 and 2. We've already marked room 4 as having a distance of 2, so we don't need to update it. The distance to room 10 through room 7 is 3. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We've already marked room 7 and room 4 as having distances, so we only need to update room 3 and room 5, which now have distances of 3. \n4. Continue this process until you've marked the distance to every room that's reachable from room 2.\n5. The shortest path from room 2 to room 10 is the path with the smallest total distance. In this case, it's the path 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 10, with a total distance of 3.\n\nAnswer: 2, 4, 8, 10"
