Create a dictionary to represent the connections between rooms.\n2. Initialize a queue for BFS and add Room 1 to it.\n3. Initialize a set to keep track of visited rooms and add Room 1 to it.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each room and add Room 1 to it with an empty path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue the next room from the queue.\n    - For each neighbor of the current room that has not been visited:\n        - Mark the neighbor as visited and add it to the queue.\n        - Add the current room to the path taken to reach the neighbor.\n        - If the neighbor is Room 9, return the path taken to reach it.\n6. If Room 9 is not found, return \"No path found\".\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 3, 9"
