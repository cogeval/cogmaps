Assign a tentative distance value of 0 to room 3, and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Set the current room to room 3.\n3. For each adjacent room to the current room, calculate the tentative distance value from the current room to that adjacent room. If the calculated distance is less than the tentative distance value of the adjacent room, update the adjacent room's tentative distance value with the calculated distance.\n4. Mark the current room as visited.\n5. Of the unvisited rooms, choose the one with the smallest tentative distance value and set it as the new current room. Repeat step 3 and 4 until all rooms are visited or the destination room (room 19) is reached.\n6. Once the destination room (room 19) is reached, backtrack through the rooms using their tentative distance values to determine the shortest path from room 3 to room 19.\n\nThe shortest path from room 3 to room 19, including room 3, is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 4, 8, 11, 13, 17, 15, 16, 20, 19"
