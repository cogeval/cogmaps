            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 8, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: set it to zero for room 2 and to infinity for all other rooms.\n2. Set the initial room as current. Mark all other rooms as unvisited.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the distance from the initial room to the neighbor, through the current room. Compare the tentative distance to the current distance value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current room is room 2 and its neighbor is room 4, the tentative distance to room 8 through room 4 would be 2 (from room 2 to room 4) + 1 (from room 4 to room 8) = 3. If the current distance value for room 8 is infinity or greater than 3, update it to 3.\n4. When we have finished considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and make it the new \"current room\" then go back to step 3.\n6. If the destination room (room 8) has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific rooms) or if the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial room and remaining unvisited rooms), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from room 2 to room 8 is: 2, 4, 8.\n\nAnswer: 2, 4, 8."
