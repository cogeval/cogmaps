Create a table with the following columns: \"Room\", \"Visited\", \"Distance\", and \"Previous\". Fill in the \"Room\" column with all the room numbers, set \"Visited\" to false for all rooms except room 7 (set it to true), set \"Distance\" to infinity for all rooms except room 7 (set it to 0), and leave \"Previous\" blank for all rooms.\n\n2. Starting from room 7, visit all the rooms that are directly connected to it (rooms 2 and 4). For each of these rooms, update the \"Distance\" column to the distance from room 7 to that room (which is 1), and update the \"Previous\" column to room 7.\n\n3. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest \"Distance\" value (which is room 2), mark it as visited, and repeat step 2 for this room.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until you have visited room 18.\n\n5. To find the shortest path, start from room 18 and follow the \"Previous\" column until you reach room 7. The path is: 7, 2, 4, 14, 10, 9, 8, 13, 17, 15, 18.\n\nAnswer: 7, 2, 4, 14, 10, 9, 8, 13, 17, 15, 18."
