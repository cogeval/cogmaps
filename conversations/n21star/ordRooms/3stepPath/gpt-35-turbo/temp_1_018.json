            "content": "To find the shortest path from room 2 to room 20, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Mark all rooms unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited rooms called the unvisited set.\n2. Assign to every room a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial room and to infinity for all other rooms. Set the initial room as current.\n3. For the current room, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. The tentative distance is the sum of the distance between the current room and the neighbor, and the tentative distance of the current room. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current room, mark the current room as visited. A visited room will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current room then go back to step 3.\n6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the destination room has been visited. The shortest path can be obtained by backtracking through the path that was used to reach the destination room, from the destination room to the starting room.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm from room 2, we can calculate the shortest path to room 20. Here are the steps:\n\n- Set all rooms as unvisited.\n- Set distance to each room as infinity, except for room 2, which is set to 0.\n- Assign room 2 as the current room.\n- Check the neighbors of room 2: rooms 4, 5, 7, and 16.\n- Calculate tentative distances for each neighbor: room 4 has a distance of 1, room 5 has a distance of 2, room 7 has a distance of 1, and room 16 has a distance of 2.\n- Update the distance values for rooms 4, 5, 7, and 16 to the newly calculated tentative distances.\n- Mark room 2 as visited.\n- Assign room 7 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 7: rooms 2 and 4.\n- Since room 2 has already been visited, we skip it. Calculate tentative distance for room 4: it has a distance of 2.\n- Update the distance value for room 4 to the newly calculated tentative distance.\n- Mark room 7 as visited.\n- Assign room 4 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 4: rooms 2, 14, and 8.\n- Since room 2 and 8 have already been visited, we skip them. Calculate tentative distance for room 14: it has a distance of 3.\n- Update the distance value for room 14 to the newly calculated tentative distance.\n- Mark room 4 as visited.\n- Assign room 14 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 14: rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n- Since room 4 and 8 have already been visited, we skip them. Calculate tentative distances for rooms 9 and 11: they have distances of 4 and 5, respectively.\n- Update the distance values for rooms 9 and 11 to the newly calculated tentative distances.\n- Mark room 14 as visited.\n- Assign room 8 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 8: rooms 9 and 11.\n- Since rooms 9 and 11 have already been visited, we skip them.\n- Mark room 8 as visited.\n- Assign room 9 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 9: rooms 11 and 13.\n- Since room 11 has already been visited, we skip it. Calculate tentative distance for room 13: it has a distance of 5.\n- Update the distance value for room 13 to the newly calculated tentative distance.\n- Mark room 9 as visited.\n- Assign room 11 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 11: rooms 13.\n- Since room 13 has already been visited, we skip it.\n- Mark room 11 as visited.\n- Assign room 13 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 13: rooms 17.\n- Since room 17 has already been visited, we skip it.\n- Mark room 13 as visited.\n- Assign room 17 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 17: rooms 15 and 20.\n- Since room 15 has already been visited, we skip it. Calculate tentative distance for room 20: it has a distance of 8.\n- Update the distance value for room 20 to the newly calculated tentative distance.\n- Mark room 17 as visited.\n- Assign room 15 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 15: rooms 16 and 20.\n- Since room 16 has already been visited, we skip it. Calculate tentative distance for room 20: it has a distance of 9.\n- Mark room 15 as visited.\n- Assign room 16 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Check the neighbors of room 16: rooms 15 and 20.\n- Since room 15 has already been visited, we skip it. Calculate tentative distance for room 20: it has a distance of 10.\n- Mark room 16 as visited.\n- Assign room 20 as the new current room, since it has the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited rooms.\n- Room 20 has been visited, so we have found the shortest path from room 2 to room 20.\n\nThe shortest path from room 2 to room 20 is: 2, 7, 4, 14, 9, 13, 17, 20.\n\nAnswer: 2, 7, 4, 14, 9, 13, 17, 20."
