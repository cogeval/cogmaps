There is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. The problem is now asking for the lowest path. There are two path: room 1 to room 2 and room 1 to room 11. With a 10 reward in room 11 and a 50 reward in room 20, then room 1 to room 11 yields the largest reward. This is not the correct result however.\nThe correct answer is room 1 to 4, then room 4 to 6, room 6 to 10, room 10 to 11, room 11 to 13, room 13 to 17, room 17 to 20.\nHow can it be 1 to 4, 4, 6, then 6 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 13, 13 to 17, 17 to 20? 4, 10, 11... 411? It's an impossible sequence.\nThe answer you want is from room 1 to room 4, then room 4 to room 6, room 6 to room 10,...\nWas this really a boss level? It was very hard.\nIs there a faster solution than recursion?\nWhat kind of logic is the judge using?\nHow can I make more efficient?\nThe answer is (1 ,4,6,10,11,13,17,18,20) but the judge thinks the answer is 1,4,6,10,11...\nI changed the program and it works now.\nWhat did I do wrong in the first solution?(It is a bit ugly)\nRecursion is too slow.
