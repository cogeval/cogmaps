Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every room: infinity for all rooms except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. \n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited and create an empty set of visited rooms.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For the current room, calculate the tentative distance to all of its neighboring rooms. Update their distances if they are lower than the current values.\n5. Mark the current room as visited and add it to the set of visited rooms.\n6. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. Repeat step 4.\n7. If the destination room (room 20 or room 10) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, continue to step 6.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path that yields the most reward as follows:\n\n1. Starting from room 1 with a distance of 0, we first visit rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. None of these rooms contain a chest with a reward, so we continue to explore.\n2. Next, we visit room 2 again (from room 7). Since this is a dead end, we backtrack to room 7, and then visit room 4 and find that it is also a dead end.\n3. We then backtrack to room 3, and visit rooms 2 and 5. Again, we find no rewards.\n4. Next, we visit room 6 and find that it leads to a dead end.\n5. We then backtrack to room 5 and visit room 16. From room 16, we visit room 15, which has a connection to room 20, where we find the chest with the reward of 50. \n6. Alternatively, we could have visited room 5 and continued to room 7, which has a connection to room 2. From room 2, we could have continued to room 4 and then to room 8 and 9. From room 9, we could have continued to room 10, where we find the chest with the reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 3, 5, 16, 15, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 5, 16, 15, 20."

Assign a tentative distance value to every room: infinity for all rooms except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. \n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited and create an empty set of visited rooms.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For the current room, calculate the tentative distance to all of its neighboring rooms. Update their distances if they are lower than the current values.\n5.

Mark the current room as visited and add it to the set of visited rooms.\n7. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. Repeat step 4 (and step 5 if the current room is room 22).\n8. If the destination room (room 20 or room 10) has been visited, stop. Otherwise, continue to step 7.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path that yields the most reward as follows:\n\n1.

From room 16, we visit room 15, which has connections to rooms 17, 18, 19, and 20. \n6. Since we want to find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to consider each possible path from room 22 to rooms 17, 18, 19, and 20. We can use the modified algorithm to calculate the tentative distances from room 22 to these rooms, and then add them to the tentative distances from room 1 to room 22. We can then select the path with the smallest tentative distance.\n7. For example, if we teleport from room 22 to room 17, the tentative distance would be: 1 (from room 1) + 6 (from room 22 to room 15) + 1 (from room 15 to room 17). Similarly, the tentative distances for teleporting to rooms 18, 19, and 20 are: 1+6+2=9, 1+6+3=10, and 1+6+4=11, respectively.\n8. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward from room 1 is: 1, 3, 5, 16, 15, 17 (or 18).\n\nAnswer: 1, 3, 5, 16, 15, 17 (or 18)."
