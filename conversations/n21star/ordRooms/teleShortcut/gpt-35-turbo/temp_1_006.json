Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16. Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13. Room 20 is connected to rooms 15, 16, and 17. Room 2 is connected to room 4. Room 13 is connected to room 17. Room 17 is connected to rooms 15. Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. We start by creating a graph with the given rooms and their connections, and assign weights to each connection based on the reward in the connected rooms.\n\nNext, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 20 or room 10 with the maximum reward. We keep track of the maximum reward we have found so far, and update it whenever we encounter a room with a higher reward. Finally, we return the path that leads to the maximum reward.\n\nUsing this approach, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 20 or room 10 with the maximum reward is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 60 (50 from room 20 and 10 from room 10).\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"

This means that we can now access room 20 from room 22 without having to go through all the rooms in between.\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm on the updated graph. The only change is that room 22 is now connected to room 15 with a weight of 0 (since we can teleport directly), and room 20 is no longer directly connected to any other room. \n\nUsing this approach, we find that the shortest path from room 1 to room 20 or room 10 with the maximum reward is:\n\n1, 22, 15, 20\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50 (50 from room 20).\n\nAnswer: 1, 22, 15, 20"
