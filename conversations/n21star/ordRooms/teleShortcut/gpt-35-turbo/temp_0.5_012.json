Create a table to keep track of the shortest distances from room 1 to each room. Initialize all distances to infinity except for room 1, which has a distance of 0. Also create a table to keep track of the rewards in each room.\n\n2. Starting from room 1, consider all adjacent rooms and update their distances and rewards if a shorter path is found. For example, room 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We can update the distances and rewards for these rooms as follows:\n\n   - Room 2: distance = 1, reward = 0\n   - Room 3: distance = 1, reward = 0\n   - Room 4: distance = 1, reward = 0\n   - Room 5: distance = 1, reward = 0\n   - Room 6: distance = 1, reward = 0\n   - Room 7: distance = 1, reward = 0\n\n3. Choose the room with the highest reward that has the shortest distance from room 1. In this case, all adjacent rooms have the same distance and reward of 0, so we can choose any of them.\n\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for the chosen room until we reach room 10 or room 20. Keep track of the path we take and the total reward.\n\n5. Compare the total rewards for the paths that reach room 10 and room 20, and choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nBased on this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 60 (50 from room 20 and 10 from room 10). \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
