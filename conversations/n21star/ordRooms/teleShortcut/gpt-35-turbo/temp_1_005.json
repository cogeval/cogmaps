Starting from room 1, we will first teleport to one of the neighboring rooms of room 15 from room 22. We will then calculate the shortest path to the chosen room and the reward for that path. Finally, we will choose the path with the highest reward among all the possible teleportation and movement combinations.\n\nHere are the possible paths and their rewards:\n\n1.

Teleport to room 18 (neighbor of room 15), then take shortest path to room 15 (reward 0): 1, 22, 18, 15. Total reward: 0.\n\n8. Teleport to room 19 (neighbor of room 15), then take shortest path to room 15 (reward 0): 1, 22, 19, 15. Total reward: 0.\n\n9. Directly take shortest path to room 20 (reward 50): 1, 2, 16, 15, 20. Total reward: 50.\n\n10. Directly take shortest path to room 10 (reward 10): 1, 2, 8, 10. Total reward: 10.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 22, 16, 15, 20 or 1, 2, 16, 15, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 22, 16, 15, 20 or 1, 2, 16, 15, 20."
