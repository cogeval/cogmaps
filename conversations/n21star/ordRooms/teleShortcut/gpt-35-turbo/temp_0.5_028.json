Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

First, we create a graph with the rooms as nodes and the connections between them as edges, where the weight of each edge is the reward in the destination room. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm from room 1 to all other rooms and keep track of the maximum reward found along each path. Finally, we choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20.

We can still use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, but we need to modify the graph accordingly.\n\nFirst, we add room 22 to the graph and connect it to room 15 with an edge of weight 0. Then, we add edges from room 22 to all the neighbors of room 15 with a weight equal to the reward in the destination room. We also update the edges from room 15 to its neighbors to have a weight of 0, since we can now teleport directly to them from room 22.\n\nRunning Dijkstra's algorithm on this modified graph, we get that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 15, 22, 16, 20.
