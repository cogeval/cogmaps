Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

From room 22, we can teleport to any neighboring room of room 15. Therefore, we need to compute the shortest path from room 1 to room 15, and from room 22 to each neighboring room of room 15, and then combine them to form a list of possible paths with their respective rewards.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can see that the shortest path from room 1 to room 15 is: 1, 7, 2, 3, 5, 16, 15. From room 22, we can teleport to rooms 16, 17, and 18, and then follow the shortest path to room 15. These paths have the following rewards:\n- Teleport to room 16: reward of 20\n- Teleport to room 17: reward of 30\n- Teleport to room 18: reward of 40\n\nTherefore, the possible paths and their rewards are:\n- Room 1 to room 15: reward of 0\n- Room 22 to room 16 to room 15: reward of 20\n- Room 22 to room 17 to room 15: reward of 30\n- Room 22 to room 18 to room 15: reward of 40\n\nSince the reward in room 18 is the highest, the final answer is:\nAnswer: 1, 7, 2, 3, 5, 16, 18, 15."
