We start at room 1 with a distance of 0 and gradually explore all neighboring rooms. \n\nFrom room 1, the neighboring rooms are rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. However, none of these rooms have a chest with a reward. We can skip these rooms and explore the next level.\n\nFrom the previous step, we know that room 2 is connected to room 4, which is connected to room 14, which has a chest with a reward of 10. We update the distance of room 4 to be 10 and add it to our priority queue. \n\nNext, we explore the neighboring rooms of room 4, which are rooms 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Room 2 and 3 do not have rewards, but room 5 is connected to room 16, which has a chest with a reward of 50. We update the distance of room 16 to be 60 (10 from room 4 and 50 from room 5) and add it to our priority queue.\n\nNow, we explore the neighboring rooms of room 5, which are rooms 2, 4, 6, and 7. Room 2 and 4 have already been explored and have distances of 10 and 11, respectively. Room 7 has already been explored as well and has a distance of 11. Room 6 is connected to room 7, which has a distance of 11. None of these rooms have rewards, so we can skip them.\n\nFinally, we explore the neighboring rooms of room 16, which are rooms 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 15 has a distance of 60 (from room 5), and room 20 has a chest with a reward of 50. We update the distance of room 20 to be 110 (60 from room 5 and 50 from room 20) and add it to our priority queue.\n\nAt this point, our priority queue contains only one room - room 20 with a distance of 110. We have explored all possible paths, and the shortest path that yields the most reward is: \n\n1, 5, 16, 20\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 16, 20"

Start at room 1 with a distance of 0 and gradually explore all neighboring rooms.\n2. Add the neighboring room 22 to the priority queue with a distance of 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, take the room with the smallest distance and explore its neighboring rooms.\n4. If a neighboring room has a chest with a reward, update its distance with the sum of the current room's distance and the chest's reward. If the room has already been explored, update its distance only if the new distance is smaller.\n5. If a neighboring room is a neighbor of room 15, also add its neighboring rooms to the priority queue with the same distance as the current room.\n\nUsing this approach, we can find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Start at room 1 with a distance of 0.\n2. Add room 22 to the priority queue with a distance of 0.\n3. Explore room 22 and add its neighboring rooms to the priority queue with a distance of 0.\n4.
