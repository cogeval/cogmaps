Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16. Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13. Room 20 is connected to rooms 15, 16, and 17. Room 2 is connected to room 4. Room 13 is connected to room 17. Room 17 is connected to rooms 15. Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The distance to room 10 is 9 and the reward is 10. Therefore, we will choose the shortest path that leads to room 20.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 20 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20."

We will use Dijkstra's algorithm again to find the shortest path from room 1 to each room that has a chest with a reward, but this time we will take into account the teleportation portal in room 22.\n\nFrom room 22, we can teleport to any neighboring room of room 15, so the shortest path from room 22 to room 15 plus the shortest path from room 15 to each chest will give us the shortest path from room 22 to each chest. Then, we can add the shortest path from room 1 to room 22 to each of these shortest paths to get the shortest path from room 1 to each chest.\n\nThe shortest path from room 1 to room 20 is still through rooms 7, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, and 20, with a distance of 14.\n\nThe shortest path from room 22 to room 15 is through room 16, with a distance of 1. Therefore, the shortest path from room 22 to room 20 is through rooms 16 and 17, with a total distance of 2 and a total reward of 50.\n\nThe shortest path from room 22 to room 10 is through room 11, with a distance of 2. Therefore, the shortest path from room 1 to room 10 is through rooms 22 and 11, with a total distance of 11 and a total reward of 10.\n\nComparing the total rewards, the path to room 20 is the most rewarding. Therefore, the shortest path from room 1 that yields the most reward is:\n\n1, 22, 16, 17, 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 22, 16, 17, 20."
