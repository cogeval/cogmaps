Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

The shortest path from room 1 to room 22 is 1-2-7-4-22 with a reward of 0. \n\nNext, we calculate the shortest paths from room 22 to each neighboring room of room 15. We can go from room 22 to room 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. The shortest paths from room 22 to each of these rooms are:\n\n- Room 15: 22-16-15 with a reward of 0\n- Room 16: 22-16 with a reward of 0\n- Room 17: 22-16-15-17 with a reward of 50\n- Room 18: 22-16-15-18 with a reward of 0\n- Room 19: 22-16-15-19 with a reward of 0\n- Room 20: 22-16-15-20 with a reward of 50\n\nFinally, we calculate the shortest paths from room 1 to each of these rooms, taking into account the teleportation option from room 22. The shortest paths from room 1 to each of these rooms, and their rewards, are:\n\n- Room 15: 1-6-5-15 with a reward of 0\n- Room 16: 1-6-5-16 with a reward of 0\n- Room 17: 1-6-5-15-17 with a reward of 50\n- Room 18: 1-6-5-15-18 with a reward of 0\n- Room 19: 1-6-5-15-19 with a reward of 0\n- Room 20: 1-6-5-15-20 with a reward of 50\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1-6-5-15-17, which has a reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1,6,5,15,17"
