Also, initialize all rewards to 0.\n2. For each room connected to room 1, update its distance to 1 and its reward to the reward in that room.\n3. Choose the room with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it is room 2 with a distance of 1.\n4. For each room connected to the chosen room, calculate the distance and reward if taking the path through the chosen room.
