We can then choose the path that yields the most reward and has the shortest total distance.\n\nHere is the list of rooms in order, starting from room 1, that yields the most reward:\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 15, 20\n\nExplanation:\n- Distance from room 1 to room 20 via room 15: 5 (1-2-4-14-15-20)\n- Distance from room 1 to room 10 via room 15: 6 (1-2-4-14-15-10)\n- Maximum reward: 50 (room 20)\n- Total distance: 5+50 = 55 (via room 15 and room 20)\n\nNote that we could also choose to go to room 10 first and then teleport to room 15 and then room 20, but that would result in a longer total distance."
