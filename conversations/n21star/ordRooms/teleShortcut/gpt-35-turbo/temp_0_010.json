Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm again, but this time we need to consider the possibility of teleporting from room 22 to any neighboring room of room 15.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we get the following shortest paths and rewards:\n\n- Room 1: reward 0\n- Room 2: reward 0\n- Room 3: reward 0\n- Room 4: reward 0\n- Room 5: reward 0\n- Room 6: reward 0\n- Room 7: reward 0\n- Room 8: reward 0\n- Room 9: reward 0\n- Room 10: reward 10 (path: 1-7-2-4-8-9-10)\n- Room 11: reward 0\n- Room 12: reward 0\n- Room 13: reward 0\n- Room 14: reward 0\n- Room 15: reward 0\n- Room 16: reward 0\n- Room 17: reward 0\n- Room 18: reward 0\n- Room 19: reward 0\n- Room 20: reward 50 (path: 1-7-2-16-15-20)\n- Room 22: reward 0 (path to 15: 22-15)\n\nTo find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. Collect the reward from room 10: In this case, the path is 1-7-2-4-8-9-10, with a reward of 10.\n\n2. Collect the reward from room 20: In this case, we can teleport from room 22 to room 15, and then follow the path to room 20. The path is 1-22-15-20, with a reward of 50.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1-22-15-20.\n\nAnswer: 1,22,15,20"
