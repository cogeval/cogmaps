Mark all rooms as unvisited and put them in a priority queue, using their tentative distances as keys.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the room with the lowest tentative distance and mark it as visited.\n\n4. For each unvisited neighbor of the extracted room, calculate a tentative distance by adding the reward of the chest in that neighbor (if any) to the extracted room's tentative distance. If the tentative distance is lower than the neighbor's current tentative distance, update it.\n\n5. Repeat step 3 until the priority queue is empty.\n\n6.
