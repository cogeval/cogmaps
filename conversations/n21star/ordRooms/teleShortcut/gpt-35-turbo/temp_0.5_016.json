Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest paths to all other rooms and their corresponding rewards. Then, we can select the room with the highest reward that can be reached by the shortest path.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we obtain the following table:\n\n| Room | Shortest Distance | Reward |\n|------|------------------|--------|\n| 1    | 0                | 0      |\n| 2    | 1                | 0      |\n| 3    | 2                | 0      |\n| 4    | 2                | 0      |\n| 5    | 2                | 0      |\n| 6    | 1                | 0      |\n| 7    | 2                | 0      |\n| 8    | 4                | 0      |\n| 9    | 5                | 0      |\n| 10   | 5                | 10     |\n| 11   | 6                | 0      |\n| 12   | 7                | 0      |\n| 13   | 6                | 0      |\n| 14   | 7                | 0      |\n| 15   | 8                | 0      |\n| 16   | 3                | 0      |\n| 17   | 7                | 0      |\n| 18   | 9                | 0      |\n| 19   | 10               | 0      |\n| 20   | 9                | 50     |\n| 21   | Inf              | 0      |\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the shortest path to room 10 yields a reward of 10, while the shortest path to room 20 yields a reward of 50. Therefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starts from room 1 and goes to room 20.\n\nAnswer: 1, 6, 2, 4, 17, 15, 20"
