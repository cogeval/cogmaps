Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We also initialize the distance from room 1 to all other rooms as infinity except for room 1 itself, which is 0. \n\nThen, we repeatedly select the unvisited room with the smallest distance and update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found. We also keep track of the room with the highest reward encountered so far. \n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 60 (50 from room 20 and 10 from room 10). \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"

We can assign a weight of 0 to the edge between room 22 and room 15, and a weight of 1 to all other edges. This means that it is more beneficial to use the teleportation portal to reach room 15 instead of traveling through multiple rooms.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 22, 15, 16, 17, 20\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50 (from room 20).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 22, 15, 16, 17, 20"
