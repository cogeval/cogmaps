Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16. Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4. Room 11 is connected to rooms 13. Room 20 is connected to rooms 15, 16, and 17. Room 2 is connected to room 4. Room 13 is connected to room 17. Room 17 is connected to rooms 15. Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms.\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n4. For the current room, calculate the tentative distance to all its neighbors (rooms that it is connected to) and update their tentative distances if they are shorter than their current tentative distances.\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n6. From the unvisited rooms, select the one with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current room. If there are no unvisited rooms left, stop.\n7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until all rooms have been visited or the chest with the reward has been found.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10. This path has a total distance of 4 and leads to the chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Note that this is the only path that leads to a chest with a reward, as the shortest path to room 20 has a total distance of 6 and the reward there is only 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10."
