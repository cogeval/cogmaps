Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by initializing the distance from room 1 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0. We also keep track of the maximum reward we can get from each room. Then, we explore the rooms connected to room 1 and update their distances and maximum rewards if necessary. We continue this process, always choosing the room with the shortest distance from room 1, until we reach room 20 or room 10. Finally, we backtrack from the room with the highest reward to room 1 to get the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the distance from room 1 to all other rooms as infinity, except for room 1 itself, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Initialize the maximum reward we can get from each room as 0.\n3. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n4. Set the current room to room 1.\n5. For each room connected to the current room:\n   - If the distance from room 1 to the connected room through the current room is shorter than its current distance, update its distance.\n   - If the reward in the connected room is higher than its current maximum reward, update its maximum reward.\n6. Mark the current room as visited.\n7. Choose the unvisited room with the shortest distance from room 1 as the next current room. If there are no unvisited rooms left, stop.\n8. If the current room is room 10 or room 20, stop.\n9. Repeat steps 5-8 until we reach room 10 or room 20.\n10. Backtrack from the room with the highest reward to room 1 to get the shortest path.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20"

This gives us the path 1, 2, 4, 14, 20. However, since the reward in room 10 is now higher than the reward in room 20, we need to backtrack and check the path to room 10 as well. We can do this by exploring the rooms connected to room 14 and updating their distances and maximum rewards. This gives us the path 1, 2, 4, 14, 10.\n\nComparing the rewards of the two paths, we see that the path to room 10 yields a higher reward, so it is the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
