We start by assigning a distance of infinity to all rooms except room 1, which has a distance of 0. Then, we visit the adjacent rooms to room 1 and update their distances with the reward of the chest if there is one. We repeat this process until we reach room 20 or room 10, whichever comes first. Finally, we backtrack from the room with the highest reward to room 1 to obtain the shortest path.\n\nThe distances and previous rooms for each room are:\n\nRoom 1: Distance 0, Previous None\nRoom 2: Distance 1, Previous 1\nRoom 3: Distance 1, Previous 1\nRoom 4: Distance 1, Previous 1\nRoom 5: Distance 1, Previous 1\nRoom 6: Distance 2, Previous 5\nRoom 7: Distance 2, Previous 1\nRoom 8: Distance 2, Previous 4\nRoom 9: Distance 2, Previous 4\nRoom 10: Distance 3, Previous 11\nRoom 11: Distance 3, Previous 13\nRoom 12: Distance Infinity, Previous None\nRoom 13: Distance 4, Previous 11\nRoom 14: Distance Infinity, Previous None\nRoom 15: Distance 3, Previous 20\nRoom 16: Distance 2, Previous 5\nRoom 17: Distance 4, Previous 13\nRoom 18: Distance 4, Previous 20\nRoom 19: Distance Infinity, Previous None\nRoom 20: Distance 4, Previous 15\nRoom 21: Distance Infinity, Previous None\n\nThe highest reward is in room 20 with a distance of 4, so we backtrack from room 20 to room 1 using the previous rooms:\n\n20 -> 15 -> 16 -> 5 -> 1\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 5, 16, 15, 20"
