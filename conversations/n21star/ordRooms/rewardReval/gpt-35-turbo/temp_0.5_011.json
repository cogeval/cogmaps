Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by assigning a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except for room 1, which we assign a tentative distance of 0. We also create a set of unvisited rooms that initially contains all rooms.\n\nThen, we iteratively select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance and update the tentative distances of its neighbors. Specifically, for each neighbor, we calculate the sum of the tentative distance of the current room and the distance between the current room and its neighbor. If this sum is smaller than the neighbor's current tentative distance, we update the neighbor's tentative distance to the sum and set the current room as the neighbor's previous room.\n\nWe repeat this process until we have visited all rooms or until the tentative distance of the room with the highest reward chest has been updated. In the latter case, we can stop the algorithm early since we know that we have found the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we find that the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20. This path has a total reward of 50, which comes from the chest in room 20. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:  Answer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20."
