Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will keep track of the distance from each visited room to the chest, as well as the total reward collected so far. \n\nThe BFS algorithm will consider all connected rooms for each visited room, except for rooms that have already been visited in previous iterations to avoid loops. \n\nHere is the path from room 1 that yields the most reward:\n\n1, 7, 4, 14, 10\n\nThis path has a total reward of 50, collected from the chest in room 20.
