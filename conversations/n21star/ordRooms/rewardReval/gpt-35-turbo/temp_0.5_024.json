Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10.

The total reward collected would be 10. \n\nNote that the shortest path to room 20 would be: 1, 2, 4, 14, 17, 20, but that only yields a reward of 50.
