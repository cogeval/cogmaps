Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Create a table to keep track of the shortest distance from room 1 to each room and the previous room in the shortest path.\n\n2. Initialize the table with the distance from room 1 to itself as 0 and the distance to all other rooms as infinity.\n\n3. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n4. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n5. For the current room, examine all connected rooms and calculate the distance to each connected room as the sum of the distance to the current room and the weight of the edge between the current room and the connected room (which is 1 for all connections in this case).\n\n6. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance in the table for the connected room, update the table with the new distance and the current room as the previous room in the shortest path.\n\n7. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n8. Select the unvisited room with the shortest distance from the table as the new current room and repeat steps 5-7 until all rooms are visited.\n\n9. Starting from room 20, follow the previous room in the shortest path back to room 1 to determine the shortest path that yields the most reward.\n\nThe shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: 1, 7, 4, 14, 10. The reward collected will be 50 from room 20. \n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 14, 10"
