Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

From room 7, we can reach room 2, which has no rewards, and room 4, which has a reward of 10. \n\nAt this point, we have explored all paths that start from room 1 and have length 2 or less. We have found two paths of length 2, one that leads to a reward of 10 (1-4-8) and one that leads to a reward of 50 (1-2-16). Since we are looking for the path that yields the most reward, we should choose the path that leads to the reward of 50.
