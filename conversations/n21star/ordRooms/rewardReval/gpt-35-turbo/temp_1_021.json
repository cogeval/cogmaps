Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will first assign a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except for room 1, which will be assigned a distance of 0. We will then iteratively update the distances to each room based on the shortest path found so far. We will also keep track of the maximum reward found so far.\n\n1. Start at room 1 with a tentative distance of 0 and maximum reward of 0.\n2. Move to room 2 with a tentative distance of 1 and maximum reward of 0.\n3. Move to room 4 with a tentative distance of 2 and maximum reward of 0.\n4. Move to room 14 with a tentative distance of 6 and maximum reward of 0.\n5. Move to room 10 with a tentative distance of 8 and maximum reward of 10.\n6. No need to move to room 11 since it is already reachable with a shorter distance from room 9.\n7. Move to room 13 with a tentative distance of 10 and maximum reward of 10.\n8. Move to room 17 with a tentative distance of 14 and maximum reward of 10.\n9. Move to room 15 with a tentative distance of 15 and maximum reward of 10.\n10.
