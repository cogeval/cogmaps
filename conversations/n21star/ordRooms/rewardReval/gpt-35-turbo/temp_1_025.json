Starting from room 1, we can calculate the shortest path to each room and keep track of the maximum reward along the way. The path with the highest reward at the end will be our answer.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Initialize the distance and reward arrays. For each room, set the initial distance to infinity and the initial reward to 0. For room 20 and 10, set the reward to 50 and 10 respectively.\n\n    Distance: [0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]\n    \n    Reward: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 50, 0]\n\n2.

While unvisited is not empty, select the room with the smallest distance and remove it from unvisited.\n\n    At first, select room 1.\n\n5. For each adjacent room that is still in unvisited, calculate a tentative distance and reward.
