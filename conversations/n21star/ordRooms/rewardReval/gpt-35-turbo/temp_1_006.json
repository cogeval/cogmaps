Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2. Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we need to perform a search algorithm. Since we can only collect one reward and we want to maximize the reward, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to both room 10 and room 20, and then choose the path with the highest reward.\n\nFirst, we will create a graph representation of the house with 21 rooms and their connections. We can represent the graph using a dictionary where the keys are the room numbers and the values are lists of adjacent room numbers.\n\n```\ngraph = {\n    1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7],\n    4: [1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 16],\n    6: [1, 2, 5, 7],\n    7: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    8: [9, 11, 13, 14],\n    9: [8, 10, 11, 13],\n    10: [9, 11, 13],\n    11: [8, 9, 10, 13],\n    12: [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14],\n    13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17],\n    14: [4, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n    15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],\n    16: [5, 15],\n    17: [13, 15],\n    18: [15, 16, 17, 20],\n    19: [15, 20],\n    20: [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21],\n    21: [15, 20]\n}\n```\n\nNext, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to both room 10 and room 20. We will keep track of the distance from room 1 to each room and the previous room in the path that led to that room.\n\n```\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    distances = {room: float('inf') for room in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    previous = {room: None for room in graph}\n\n    pq = [(0, start)]\n    while pq:\n        current_distance, current_room = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if current_distance > distances[current_room]:\n            continue\n        for neighbor in graph[current_room]:\n            distance = current_distance + 1\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                previous[neighbor] = current_room\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))\n\n    return distances, previous\n\ndistances_to_10, previous_10 = dijkstra(graph, 1)\ndistances_to_20, previous_20 = dijkstra(graph, 1)\n```\n\nNow, we can check the distance from room 1 to both room 10 and room 20, and the reward in each room.\n\n```\nrewards = {\n    10: 10,\n    20: 50\n}\n\ndistance_to_10 = distances_to_10[10]\ndistance_to_20 = distances_to_20[20]\n\nreward_in_10 = rewards[10] if distances_to_10[10] < float('inf') else 0\nreward_in_20 = rewards[20] if distances_to_20[20] < float('inf') else 0\n```\n\nFinally, we can choose the path that yields the most reward and return the sequence of rooms that form that path.\n\n```\nif reward_in_20 > reward_in_10:\n    current_room = 20\n    previous = previous_20\nelse:\n    current_room = 10\n    previous = previous_10\n\npath = [current_room]\nwhile previous[current_room] != 1:\n    path.append(previous[current_room])\n    current_room = previous[current_room]\npath.append(1)\n\npath.reverse()\nanswer = 'Answer: ' + ', '.join(map(str, path))\n```\n\nThe answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10\n```\n\nThis is the shortest path from room 1 to room 10 that yields the most reward, with a total distance of 4 and a reward of 10. The other path from room 1 to room 20 has a total distance of 5 and a reward of 50, but since we can only collect one reward, the path to room 10 is the best option."
