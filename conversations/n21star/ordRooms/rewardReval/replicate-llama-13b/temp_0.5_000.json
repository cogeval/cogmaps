(Note that rooms 1 and 20 are only connected to one other room. Therefore, they only need to be addressed once in this step.)\nDetermine which rooms have a reward of 50.\nDetermine which rooms have a reward of 10.\nOnce you have answered all of these questions, you are done!\nLet's start by addressing #1.\nThink through each room. For each connected room pair, place a number in between them, with a comma.\nAnswer: ,7,2\nWe see that room 7, 2 are connected together. We also see that 7 is connected to 18 and 1. (1 is never connected to either because the answer does not start with 1.)\nThis means that we need to place a 1 between room 7 and room 8.\nBecause we added the 1, we see that 1 and 9 are no longer connected, and 1 needs to be connected to 5.\nWe don't have to worry about 1 and 19 because they are connected and do not need to be connected again.\nNow let's solve #2.\nWe know that room 2 has a reward of 50, and that we need to find the shortest path to the most reward.\nTherefore, we connect 1 to 2.\nWe have connected 1 to 2, and they both have a reward of 50, so we connect 2 to 7 because they both have rewards of 50.\nBecause we connect 2 to 7, we must disconnect 2 from room 3.\nWe've just disconnected 2 from 3, so now we need a reward for 2 and 3. We know they have rewards of 50 by the constraints.\nTherefore, we connect 2 to 9.\nNow we can connect 2 and 9 to room 5 and 7.\nIn addition, the 1, 3, 5, and 15 are part of the same shortest path.
