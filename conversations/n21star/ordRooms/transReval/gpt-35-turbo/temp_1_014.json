Assign a tentative distance value to all rooms. Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n\n2. Mark all rooms as unvisited.\n\n3. Set the current room to room 1.\n\n4. For the current room, consider all of its neighboring rooms and calculate their tentative distances. Update the distance value of each neighboring room if it is less than its current tentative distance.\n\n5. Mark the current room as visited.\n\n6. If the destination room (room 10 or room 20) has been visited or all unvisited rooms have been marked with infinite distance, stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited room that is marked with the smallest tentative distance as the next room to visit. Set the current room to this room and go back to step 4.\n\nSince the reward in room 20 is higher, we will aim for that room. Here are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Room 1 is connected to rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. None of these rooms have rewards, so we will mark them as unvisited and with a tentative distance of infinity, except for room 2, which has a tentative distance of 1.\n\n2.
