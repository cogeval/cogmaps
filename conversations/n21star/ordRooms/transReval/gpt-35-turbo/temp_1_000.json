Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

We will calculate the shortest path from room 1 to all other rooms and keep track of the total reward collected along each path.

Initialize the distance and reward arrays:\n   - Set the distance of room 1 to 0 and the distance of all other rooms to infinity.\n   - Set the reward of room 10 and room 20 to 10 and 50, respectively, and the reward of all other rooms to 0.\n\n2. Create a priority queue and add room 1 with distance 0 and reward 0.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Pop the room with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   - For each of its neighbors, calculate the distance and reward of the path through this room.\n   - If the calculated distance is smaller than the recorded distance, update the distance and reward arrays and add the neighbor to the queue with its new distance and reward.\n\n4.
