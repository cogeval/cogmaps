Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

            "content": "To determine the shortest path that yields the most reward, we can use a graph algorithm called Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph with each room as a node and each connection as a weighted edge with the weight being the reward in the connected room (0 for unconnected rooms).\n2. Initialize the starting node (room 1) with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\n3. For each node, record the shortest path to the starting node that has been found so far.\n4. Visit each node in order of increasing distance from the starting node. For each node, update the distances and shortest paths of its unvisited neighbors if the new path is shorter.\n5. When the target node (room 20 or 10) is visited, terminate the algorithm and return the shortest path found.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm with a goal of reaching room 20 (with reward of 50), we get the shortest path from room 1 as follows: 1, 2, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20. This path has a total reward of 50.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm with a goal of reaching room 10 (with reward of 10), we get the shortest path from room 1 as follows: 1, 2, 4, 8, 10. This path has a total reward of 10.\n\nTherefore, the path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is 1, 2, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20, with a total reward of 50.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 11, 13, 17, 20"
