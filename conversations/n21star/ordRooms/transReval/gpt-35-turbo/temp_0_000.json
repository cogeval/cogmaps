We will treat the reward for visiting a room as the weight of the corresponding edge in the graph. \n\nFirst, we need to update the graph to reflect the fact that rooms 4 and 17 are connected. We can add an edge with weight 0 between these two rooms.\n\nThe updated graph is as follows:\n\nRoom 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nRoom 2: 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 16\nRoom 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 16\nRoom 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 17\nRoom 5: 2, 4, 7, 16\nRoom 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\nRoom 7: 2, 4, 6\nRoom 8: 9, 11, 13\nRoom 9: 8, 11, 13\nRoom 10: 11, 13, 8, 9\nRoom 11: 10, 13, 8, 9\nRoom 12: 13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11\nRoom 13: 17, 8, 9, 11, 12\nRoom 14: 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\nRoom 15: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21\nRoom 16: 2, 3, 5, 15\nRoom 17: 13, 15, 4\nRoom 18: 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21\nRoom 19: 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21\nRoom 20: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21\nRoom 21: 15, 18, 19, 20\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from room 4 to room 13 that yields the most reward. The path with the highest reward is:\n\n4, 14, 12, 13\n\nThe total reward for this path is 30 (10 for room 13, 10 for room 12, and 10 for room 14).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 4, 14, 12, 13"
