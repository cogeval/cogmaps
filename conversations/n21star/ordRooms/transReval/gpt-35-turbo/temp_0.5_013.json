We will start by assigning a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms. Then, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 1 and update their tentative distances if they are shorter than their current values. We will repeat this process until we reach room 20 or room 10, and then backtrack to find the shortest path.\n\nThe tentative distances for the rooms are as follows:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: infinity\nRoom 3: infinity\nRoom 4: infinity\nRoom 5: infinity\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: infinity\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: infinity\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 1:\n\n- Room 2: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 3: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 4: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 5: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 6: distance = 0 + infinity = infinity\n- Room 7: distance = 0 + infinity = infinity\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: infinity\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: infinity\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 2:\n\n- Room 4: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 7: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: infinity\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 3:\n\n- Room 2: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 4: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 5: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 7: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: infinity\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 4:\n\n- Room 2: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 16: distance = 0 + 50 = 50\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: infinity\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: 50\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 5:\n\n- Room 14: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nWe update the tentative distances for this room:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: 0\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: 50\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 7:\n\n- Room 2: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nWe update the tentative distance for this room:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: infinity\nRoom 9: infinity\nRoom 10: infinity\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: 0\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: 50\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 14:\n\n- Room 8: distance = 0 + 10 = 10\n- Room 9: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n- Room 10: distance = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: 10\nRoom 9: 0\nRoom 10: 0\nRoom 11: infinity\nRoom 12: infinity\nRoom 13: infinity\nRoom 14: 0\nRoom 15: infinity\nRoom 16: 50\nRoom 17: infinity\nRoom 18: infinity\nRoom 19: infinity\nRoom 20: infinity\n\nNext, we will explore the neighboring rooms of room 8:\n\n- Room 9: distance = 10 + 0 = 10\n- Room 11: distance = 10 + infinity = infinity\n- Room 13: distance = 10 + 0 = 10\n\nWe update the tentative distances for these rooms:\n\nRoom 1: 0\nRoom 2: 0\nRoom 3: 0\nRoom 4: 0\nRoom 5: 0\nRoom 6: infinity\nRoom 7: 0\nRoom 8: 10\nRoom 9: 10\nRoom 10: "
