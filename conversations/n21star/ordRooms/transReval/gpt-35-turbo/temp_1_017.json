Assign a tentative distance of infinity to all rooms except for room 1, which has a tentative distance of 0. Set all rooms as unvisited.\nAnswer: \n\n2. Select the unvisited room with the smallest tentative distance, which is room 1. Visit room 1.\nAnswer: 1\n\n3. For the current room (room 1), consider all of its neighbors (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) that are both unvisited and accessible from the current room. For each neighbor, calculate the tentative distance from the starting room (room 1) and add the reward in that room, if any. If the tentative distance is less than the neighbor's current tentative distance, update the neighbor's tentative distance. Then mark the current room as visited.\nAnswer: 1, 2 (reward: 0), 3 (reward: 0), 4 (reward: 0), 5 (reward: 0), 6 (reward: 0), 7 (reward: 0)\n\n4.
