Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

In this case, the vertices of the graph are the rooms and the edges are the connections between the rooms. The weight of each edge is the distance between the two rooms.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is:\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20\n\nThis path has a total distance of 14 and a total reward of 50, which is the maximum reward possible. The path goes from room 1 to room 2, then to room 4, which leads to room 14 where the reward of 10 is collected. Then, the path goes to room 10 to collect the reward of 50, and finally to room 20, which is the destination.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10, 20"
