Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. \n\nFirst, we need to create a graph to represent the connections between the rooms. We can represent the graph using a dictionary where each key represents a room number and the value is a list of the rooms that it is connected to. \n\n```\ngraph = {\n    1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16],\n    3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 16],\n    4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 14],\n    5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 16],\n    6: [1, 2, 5, 7],\n    7: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    8: [4, 9, 11, 13, 14],\n    9: [4, 8, 10, 11, 13],\n    10: [9, 11, 13, 14, 8],\n    11: [8, 9, 10, 13],\n    12: [13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n    13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 12],\n    14: [4, 8, 9, 10, 12],\n    15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],\n    16: [2, 3, 5, 15],\n    17: [13, 15, 18, 20],\n    18: [15, 17, 19, 20],\n    19: [15, 18, 20, 21],\n    20: [15, 17, 18, 19, 21],\n    21: [15, 19, 20]\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to assign a reward value to each room that has a chest. We can represent the reward values using a dictionary where each key represents a room number and the value is the reward value of that room.\n\n```\nrewards = {\n    10: 10,\n    20: 50\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to any room that has a chest, while keeping track of the maximum reward.\n\n```\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, rewards):\n    pq = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    while pq:\n        (dist, node, path) = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            path = path + [node]\n            if node in rewards:\n                return (dist, path, rewards[node])\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist + 1, neighbor, path))\n    return (float('inf'), [], 0)\n\nshortest_path = dijkstra(graph, 1, rewards)\n```\n\nThe output will be a tuple containing the shortest distance from room 1 to a chest, the path from room 1 to the chest, and the maximum reward.\n\n```\nAnswer: 1,2,16,15,20"
