            "content": "To find the shortest path that yields the most reward, we need to determine the shortest path from room 1 to room 20 or 10, and then check which of those rooms has the highest reward. \n\nOne possible approach is to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to each of the rooms that contain a chest. Then, we can compare the rewards of those rooms and choose the one with the highest reward.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can first create a graph of the connections between the rooms and their distances. Each edge has a weight of 1, since all connections are equally distant. Then, we can use a priority queue to explore the rooms in order of their distance from room 1.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from room 1 to room 20 or 10:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 vertices, one for each room. Add edges between the rooms based on the connections given in the problem, with a weight of 1 for each edge.\n\n2. Initialize a priority queue and a dictionary to store the distance from room 1 to each room.\n\n3. Set the distance of room 1 to 0, and add it to the priority queue.\n\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, take the room with the smallest distance from room 1.\n\n5. For each room connected to the current room, calculate the distance to that room as the sum of the current room's distance and the weight of the edge between them.\n\n6. If this distance is less than the previously recorded distance for that room, update the distance and add the room to the priority queue.\n\n7. Once we have calculated the distance to both room 20 and room 10, compare their rewards and choose the room with the highest reward as the final destination.\n\nHere is the shortest path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 10\n\nThe reward for room 10 is 10, which is less than the reward for room 20, so the final destination is room 20.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from room 1 to the room with the highest reward is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 20\n\nAnswer: 1,2,4,14,20"
