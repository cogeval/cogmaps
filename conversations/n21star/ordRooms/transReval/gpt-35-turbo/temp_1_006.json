Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

First, we will assign a tentative distance of 0 to room 1 and infinity to all other rooms. We will also keep track of the room with the highest reward we have encountered so far. \n\n2. Then, we will look at all the rooms connected to room 1 (rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and update their tentative distances and rewards if they are higher than the current highest reward.\n\n3. Among these rooms, we will choose the one with the smallest tentative distance and mark it as visited. In this case, room 2 has the smallest tentative distance of 0.\n\n4. We will repeat step 2 and 3 for all the rooms connected to the current room (room 2), updating their tentative distances and rewards and keeping track of the highest reward encountered so far.\n\n5. We will continue this process until we reach room 20 or room 10.\n\n6. Once we reach either room 20 or room 10, we will backtrack from that room to room 1, following the path with the smallest tentative distance at each step.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path that yields the most reward starting from room 1 is: \n\n1, 2, 4, 14, 10 \n\nTotal reward: 50. \n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 14, 10"
