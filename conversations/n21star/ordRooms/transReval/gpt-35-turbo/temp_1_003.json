Starting from room 1, we calculate the shortest distance to all the rooms and keep track of the maximum reward found so far. We will also keep track of the path taken to reach each room. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path that yields the most reward:\n\n1. Initialize all distances to infinity except for room 1, which we set to 0. Initialize the maximum reward found so far to 0.\n2. Create a set of unvisited rooms and add all rooms to it.\n3. While the set of unvisited rooms is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Choose the unvisited room with the smallest distance, call it \"current\".\n   2. For each neighbor of the current room, calculate the distance to that neighbor through the current room. If this distance is less than the current distance of the neighbor, update the distance and the path to the neighbor.\n   3. If the current room is room 20 or room 10 and the reward in that room is greater than the maximum reward found so far, update the maximum reward found so far.\n   4. Remove the current room from the set of unvisited rooms.\n4. The path that yields the maximum reward found so far is the path taken to reach either room 20 or room 10.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm starting from room 1, the shortest path that yields the most reward is:\n\nAnswer: 1, 7, 4, 14, 10"
