Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

            "content": "Thank you for your help.\nThis is a simple AI question. Firstly, the user has to determine what are the rooms. In the room, there are different connections. If the shortest path yields the biggest reward, then the user should look at the largest number first. Then, he can obtain the number of rooms, so that he can find out the final result.\nThe final result should be '4,10,20,' because the shortest path is to go straight to 20 from 1 after obtaining 10, and then obtain 10 first. So the answer is '4,10,20,' The solution is shown as below:\nNow, the user could use 'regex' to get the desired result.\nAnswer: 4,10,20,50,50,10,10,20,10,4,-1,-2,-1,-2,4,-1,-2,-1,-2,4,-1,-2,-1,-2,4,50,-1,50,-1,10,-1,10,-1,10,20,-1,20,15,-1,16,-1,20,15,-1,20,15,-1,16,-1,20,4,-1,10,11,-1,13,4,5,13,6,8,13,12,14,8,9,14,7,10,11,3,12,4,5,14,7,10,11,-1,13;"
