Room 14 is connected to rooms 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Room 10 is connected to rooms 11, 13, 8, and 9. Room 19 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Room 5 is connected to rooms 7, 2, and 16. Room 8 is connected to rooms 9, 11, and 13. Room 9 is connected to rooms 11 and 13. Room 18 is connected to rooms 20, 15, 16, and 17. Room 7 is connected to rooms 2, and 4.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest.

Suppose we have collected 4 reward. We should be able to reach the first 3 chests with this amount of reward.\n\"10,11,16,17\"\nRoom 16 has already been visited. If we reach chests in rooms 14,12,11,10, it remains to reach chests in room 15, room 17 and room 8 to finish.\n\"16,12,11,10,8\"\nSo basically my final path is:\n\"21,16,12,11,10,8\"\nNow we can only reach 8,9,11,13. We only need to look at room 13 and chest 17 from our previous path. Then we only need to traverse 17 and 15 and 10 to get our final path.\nCan I have a little feedback from the Judge, please?\nYou say that there is one reward per chest. I wonder if there can be multiple rewards per chest. This solution works for 1 reward per chest, but fails if there can be more than 1.\nThe reward will be a integer or integer range (e.g. 5-50).\nThank you for your feedback Judge.\nThen the solution is: \"21,8,9,11,14,15,13\"\nIt should work for multi rewards per chest, as long as it is possible to collect 8 rewards for a certain chest.\nCan anyone confirm the correctness of our solution from this hint?\nYou're right. Thanks for helping us out. I've retested your code and it does work. It's been fixed for version 109469. Cheers!\nThank you so much Judge!\nCould someone please explain why the second solution is invalid?\nI'll let the"

This does result in many solutions being rejected.\nThanks for confirming.\nIt seemed that users may need to redo their entire solution at any hint change\nThe algorithm we suggested may not work in some of the cases.
