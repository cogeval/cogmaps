Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

I use re.findall() and if I write the number of rooms that each number is connected to I get a list with a lot of numbers.\nFinally use re.search().\nI get lots of numbers in the number2 but they are the wrong ones. I checked by hand and sure got to be wrong.\n1/2/13/17/1/2 or 1/2/14/17/1/4\nThe numbers of rooms that they are connected to it doesn't matter because the numbers are not important in the problem. What actually matters is:\nThe first room has no reward, it's just to get the list of rooms connected for each digit.\nThe second room has a reward so you should get the two shortest ways to get it with the most positive effect.\nSo I do re.search() on the list. The list get to a few thousand numbers, then I filter them in the way that the number connected with that room is the same for both ways. Then, I find out the smallest value between two numbers. Then I sort from the smallest to big and I just take first and second number, because that"
