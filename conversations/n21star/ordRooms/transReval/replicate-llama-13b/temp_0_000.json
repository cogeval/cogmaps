Room 21 is connected to rooms 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Room 6 is connected to rooms 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Room 3 is connected to rooms 4, 5, 7, and 2.

Room 15 is connected to room 16. You have been told that there is a chest with a reward of 50 in room 20 and there is a chest with a reward of 10 in room 10. Now, from room 1 what is the shortest path that yields the most reward? Remember that you can collect the reward only once and only from one chest. Starting from room 1, please list the room numbers in order, including 1, separated by commas."

Without wasting more words and ink, the optimized breadth-first path steps to obtain the maximum possible score and prize(50+10) are by following next routes below(starting, logically from 1 then jump in numbering), you MIH pay good attention as you consider and choose each steps carefully from any position within the path to optimize chances for both items: room numbers separating in list with commas as below the description:  Step 1- rooms: {4, 5, 2, 3}, prize {8};\nThis answer breaks step numbers separated a with prize associated each with comma, also note carefully of the last entry with commas 2 times; The last answer is one continuous String with double  com separated lists. So I answer all questions and make recommendations to follow step no (). Remember the shortest distances depend first order search with optimization techniques, but feel open enough let A if needed and think carefully of choosing rooms for each time your step into action because it won"
