Then, I will find out the books priced between $1000 and $10,000 and sort them. Then I will find out the books priced between $10,000 and $100,000 and sort them. Finally, I will find out the books priced above $100,000 and sort them.\n\nRex: Okay, Danny. So far so good. But remember that you can only choose one book.
