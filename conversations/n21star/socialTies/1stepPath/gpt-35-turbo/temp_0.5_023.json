Check if Jing is connected to Pam directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Pam.\n3. If Jing is not connected to Pam directly, check the connections of Jing's connections.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each level of connections until Pam is found.\n5. Keep track of the path taken to reach each scholar.\n6. Once Pam is found, backtrack the path from Pam to Jing to obtain the shortest path.\n\nUsing the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Starting with Jing.\n2. Jing is not directly connected to Pam.\n3. Jing is connected to the following scholars: Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim.\n4. None of these scholars are connected to Pam.\n5. No path found yet, let's move to the next level of connections.\n6. Wei is connected to Eva.\n7. Eva is connected to Matt.\n8. Matt is connected to Amy.\n9. Amy is connected to Pari.\n10. Pari is connected to Puja.\n11. Puja is connected to Kim.\n12. Kim is connected to Pam.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Puja, Kim, Pam"
