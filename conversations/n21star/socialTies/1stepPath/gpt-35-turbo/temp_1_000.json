Check if Amir is connected directly to Wim. If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Wim. Answer: Amir, Wim.\n3. If Amir is not directly connected to Wim, check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza).\n4. Add all the connections to a queue (in the order they are mentioned in the problem statement): Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n5. Mark Amir as visited.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the next person in the queue until Wim is found or the queue is empty.\n7. If the queue becomes empty before finding Wim, it means there is no path from Amir to Wim.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Start: Amir\n2. Check if Amir is directly connected to Wim: No\n3. Add Amir's connections to the queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n4. Mark Amir as visited\n5. Take the next person from the queue: Wim\n6. Check if Wim is directly connected to Wim: Yes\n7. Shortest path found: Answer: Amir, Wim\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Wim is Amir, Wim."
