Check if Amir is connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Nisha.\n3. If not connected, check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza).\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to Nisha. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, the connected scholar, and Nisha.\n5. If not, repeat step 4 for each of Amir's connections' connections until Nisha is found.\n6. If a connection leads to a scholar that has already been visited, skip that scholar to avoid infinite loops.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Amir -> Nisha: Not connected directly.\n2. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n3. Wim -> Nisha: Not connected.\n4. Raj -> Nisha: Not connected.\n5. Jing -> Nisha: Not connected.\n6. Wei -> Nisha: Connected.\n7. Shortest path: Amir, Wei, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Nisha"
