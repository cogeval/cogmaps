Create an empty visited set to keep track of the scholars we have visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue and assign it to the current_scholar variable.\n   b. If the current_scholar is Amir, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. If the current_scholar has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue all its connected scholars (according to the given connections) into the queue.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Wei to Amir.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Reza, Wim, Amir"
