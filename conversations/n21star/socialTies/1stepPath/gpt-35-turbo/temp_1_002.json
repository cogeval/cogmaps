Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Check if any of these scholars is Jing. If yes, then the shortest path is just Amir, Jing.\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Amir, we need to explore further. Since Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza, we need to consider each of these scholars one by one.\n4. Let's start with Wim. From Wim, we can check the scholars he is connected to. Wim is connected to Jing, so the path becomes Amir, Wim, Jing.\n5. Now let's move on to Raj. Raj is connected to Jing, so the path becomes Amir, Raj, Jing. Note that we have already found a path with fewer scholars (Amir, Wim, Jing), so we will not consider this path further.\n6. Continuing this process for the other scholars, we find that there are no other paths that lead directly to Jing.\n7. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Jing is Amir, Wim, Jing.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing"
