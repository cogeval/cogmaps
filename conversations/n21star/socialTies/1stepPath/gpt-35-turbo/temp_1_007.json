Start with Wim as the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim into it.\n3. Create an empty list to store the path and add Wim to the list.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued scholar is Raj, stop the search and return the path.\n   c. For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that has not been visited, do the following steps:\n      - Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n      - Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n      - Add the connected scholar to the path.\n\nUsing the given connections, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim and mark it as visited.\n3. Current path: Wim\n4. Dequeue Wim.\n   - Wim is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Raj.\n   - Enqueue Jing, Wei, Reza, and Raj.\n   - Mark Jing, Wei, Reza, and Raj as visited.\n   - Current path: Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, Raj\n5. Dequeue Jing.\n   - Jing is connected to Raj and Wei.\n   - Enqueue Raj and Wei.\n   - Mark Raj and Wei as visited.\n   - Current path: Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza, Raj\n6. Dequeue Raj.\n   - Raj is the destination. Stop the search and return the path.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Raj"
