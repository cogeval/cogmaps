If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Raj.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Since Raj is not in Amir's connections, we need to explore further. We will add Amir's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue, which is Wim.\n6. Check if Wim is connected to Raj. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, Wim, and Raj.\n7. If not, add Wim's connections (Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza) to the queue.\n8. Continue this process until Raj is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to Raj:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj"
