Create a queue and enqueue Raj as the starting point.\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty path list to store the current path from Raj to the current scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Jing, we have found the shortest path. Return the path list.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, add the scholar to the visited set and append the scholar to the path list.\n   - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar, except for the ones that have already been visited.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Jing is not found, there is no path from Raj to Jing.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Jing:\n\n1. Enqueue Raj.\n2. Visited: {Raj}\n   Path: [Raj]\n3. Dequeue Raj.\n4. Enqueue Jing, Wei, Wim, Reza.\n   Visited: {Raj, Jing}\n   Path: [Raj, Jing]\n5. Dequeue Jing.\n6. Enqueue Reza, Wei, Wim.\n   Visited: {Raj, Jing, Reza}\n   Path: [Raj, Jing, Reza]\n7. Dequeue Reza.\n8. Enqueue Wim.\n   Visited: {Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim}\n   Path: [Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim]\n9. Dequeue Wim.\n10. Enqueue Wei.\n    Visited: {Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim, Wei}\n    Path: [Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim, Wei]\n11. Dequeue Wei.\n12. No more scholars to enqueue.\n    Path: [Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim, Wei]\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Raj to Jing is: Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim, Wei.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim, Wei"
