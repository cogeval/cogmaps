Create an empty visited set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty path list to store the path from Wim to Wei.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Wei, break the loop.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - Add the scholar to the path list.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. If Wei is not found, return an empty path.\n6. If Wei is found, return the path list from Wim to Wei.\n\nNow, let me execute these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Wei.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei"
