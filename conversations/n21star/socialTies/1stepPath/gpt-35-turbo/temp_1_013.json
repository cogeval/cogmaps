We will also keep track of the parent scholar for each connected scholar. \n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Wim:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Raj and set its distance to 0.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   c. If the scholar is Wim, stop the search.\n   d. Otherwise, for each connected scholar of the current scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n      i. Enqueue the connected scholar.\n      ii. Set its distance from Raj as the distance of the current scholar plus 1.\n      iii. Set its parent as the current scholar.\n4. Once we have found Wim, we can backtrack from Wim to Raj using the parent information to get the shortest path.\n5. The shortest path will be the sequence of scholar names from Raj to Wim, including both Raj and Wim.\n\nLet's go through these steps and find the shortest path from Raj to Wim."
