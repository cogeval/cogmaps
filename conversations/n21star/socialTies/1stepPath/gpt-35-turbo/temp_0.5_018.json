Since we want to reach Amir, we can ignore Moin and Puja and choose either Kim or Ian. Let's choose Kim: Jing, Pam, Kim.\n\nKim is connected to Ian and Puja. We can add Ian to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian.\n\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari. We can add Puja to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja.\n\nPuja is connected to scholars Pari. We can add Pari to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari.\n\nPari is connected to Amy. We can add Amy to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy.\n\nAmy is connected to Matt. We can add Matt to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt.\n\nMatt is connected to Eva. We can add Eva to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva.\n\nEva is connected to Wei. We can add Wei to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei.\n\nWei is connected to Reza. We can add Reza to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Reza.\n\nReza is connected to Wim. We can add Wim to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Reza, Wim.\n\nWim is connected to Amir. We can add Amir to the path: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Reza, Wim, Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Amir is: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Reza, Wim, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Reza, Wim, Amir."
