Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path. \n\nStarting from Amir, we will explore the connections in a breadth-first manner. We will keep track of the number of books each scholar is donating and update it as we traverse the connections.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to perform breadth-first search.\n2. Enqueue Amir and set the number of books he is donating as 0.\n3. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books encountered during the search and set it as 0.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books and set it as an empty string.\n5. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. If the number of books the current scholar is donating is greater than the maximum number of books encountered, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   c. Enqueue the connected scholars of the current scholar who haven't been visited before, and update the number of books they are donating by adding the number of books from the current scholar.\n6. Return the scholar with the maximum number of books encountered.\n\nLet's follow this process to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Eva, Amy, Matt, Prem"
