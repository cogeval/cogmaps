We will start with Amir and explore each of his connections, considering the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the scholars to explore.\n2. Mark Amir as visited and enqueue him into the queue.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Initialize the number of books donated by Amir as 0.\n5. Create a dictionary to store the previous scholar in the path for each visited scholar.\n6. Initialize the previous scholar of Amir as None.\n7. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books found and initialize it as 0.\n8. Create a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books found and initialize it as None.\n9. While the queue is not empty:\n   9.1. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   9.2. If the number of books donated by this scholar is greater than the current maximum:\n        9.2.1. Update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books found.\n   9.3. For each connected scholar of the dequeued scholar:\n        9.3.1. If the connected scholar is not visited:\n                9.3.1.1. Mark the connected scholar as visited.\n                9.3.1.2. Enqueue the connected scholar into the queue.\n                9.3.1.3. Update the number of books donated by the connected scholar by adding the number of books donated by the previous scholar.\n                9.3.1.4. Update the previous scholar of the connected scholar to be the dequeued scholar.\n10. Starting from the scholar with the maximum number of books, traverse the path backward using the previous scholar dictionary and add each scholar's name to the result list until reaching Amir.\n11. Reverse the result list to get the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's execute the steps and determine the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wei, Eva, Prem"
