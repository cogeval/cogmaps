Since we need to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, we will consider Zack as the target.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from Amir, we will explore each connected scholar and continue to their connections until we reach Zack. We will keep track of the visited scholars and their distance from Amir.\n\nUsing the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to Zack is as follows:\nAmir, Wim, Eva, Zack\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books (Zack) is:\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Zack"
