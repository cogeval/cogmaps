Among these connections, only Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n\nSince Nisha is connected to Reza, we need to check if Reza has more books than Nisha. However, there is no information available regarding the number of books possessed by Reza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books based on the given information."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Among these connections, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the number of books donated:\n\n- Moin is donating 49 books.\n- Prem is donating 11 books.\n\nSince Moin is donating the maximum number of books, we will consider the shortest path from Amir to Moin.\n\nThe path from Amir to Moin, considering the connections and the maximum number of books donated, is as follows:\n\nAmir, Nisha, Moin\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is: Answer: Amir, Nisha, Moin."
