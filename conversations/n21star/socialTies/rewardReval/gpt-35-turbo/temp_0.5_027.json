We know that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nNext, let's determine the connections of each scholar to find the shortest path. Based on the given information:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\nWim is connected to Jing.\nJing is connected to Wei.\nWei is connected to Reza and Eva.\nEva is connected to Matt.\nMatt is connected to Amy.\nAmy is connected to Prem.\nPrem is connected to Ming.\nMing is connected to Gia.\nGia is connected to Amy.\nAmy is connected to Pari.\nPari is connected to Ian.\nIan is connected to Kim.\nKim is connected to Puja.\nPuja is connected to Moin.\n\nNow, let's find the scholar with the maximum number of books. From the connections, we can see that Prem has the maximum number of books (50).\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Prem, we can follow the connections:\n\nAmir -> Nisha -> Reza -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Amy -> Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Prem"
