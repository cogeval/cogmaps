You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar connected to him, then explore their connections, and so on, until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the scholars to explore.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Set the number of books donated by Prem to 50 and the number of books donated by Moin to 10.\n5. Create a dictionary to store the connections of each scholar.\n6. Initialize the connections of each scholar based on the given information.\n7. Create a dictionary to store the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n8. Set the shortest path from Amir to Amir as Amir.\n9. While the queue is not empty:\n   1. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   2. If the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books, update the maximum number of books and the person with the maximum number of books.\n   3. Explore each connection of the scholar:\n      1. If the connection has not been visited:\n         1. Enqueue the connection into the queue.\n         2. Update the number of books donated by the connection based on the number of books donated by the scholar.\n         3. Update the connection's shortest path as the concatenation of the scholar's shortest path and the connection's name.\n         4. Mark the connection as visited.\n10. Return the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Queue: [Amir]\n2. Number of books donated: {Prem: 50, Moin: 10}\n3.

Shortest path: {Amir: Amir}\n\nNow we will perform the BFS algorithm:\n\n1. Dequeue Amir.\n2. Amir has no connections with more books, so continue exploring the connections.\n   1. Enqueue Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n   2. Update the number of books donated by Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n   3. Update their shortest path from Amir.\n   4. Mark them as visited.\n3.
