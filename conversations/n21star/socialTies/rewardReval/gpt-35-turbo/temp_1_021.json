Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir as the initial node.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the path from each scholar to their previous scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Mark the scholar as visited.\n   c. Check if the scholar has more books than the maximum number of books seen so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   d. If the scholar has any connected scholars that have not been visited, enqueue them and update their previous scholar in the dictionary.\n6.
