Each scholar will be a node, and the connections between them will be the edges.\n\nTo find the person with the maximum number of books, we need to calculate the total number of books donated by each scholar. From the given information, we know that Prem is donating 50 books, and Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nNext, we can perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from Amir to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books. During the BFS, we will keep track of the total number of books each scholar has donated.\n\nLet's start the BFS from Amir:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the total number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Set the total number of books donated by Prem as 50 and Moin as 10.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum.\n   - If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n   - Update the total number of books donated by each connected scholar.\n   - Mark the connected scholars as visited.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given information, we can start the BFS from Amir and follow the steps above to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Prem"
