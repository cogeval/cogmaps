Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar and not yet visited, add them to the queue, mark them as visited, and update their path.\n5.
