Initialize a queue to store the scholars and a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 4-7.\n4. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n5. Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, we have found the shortest path.
