Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We need to check the number of books donated by each of these scholars. \n\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of these scholars have donated any books, so we move on.\n\nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Again, none of these scholars have donated any books, so we move on.\n\nJing is connected to Wei, Reza, Raj, and Wim. Similarly, none of these scholars have donated any books.\n\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Pari, who has donated books. However, since Pari is not the person with the maximum number of books, we continue the search.\n\nReza is connected to Wim and Jing, but neither of them have donated any books.\n\nWim is connected to Jing, but Jing does not have any books.\n\nBased on the connections, it seems that there are no scholars connected to Amir who have donated any books. Therefore, we need to explore other connections. However, since we are looking for the shortest path, we can conclude that the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is just Amir.\n\nAnswer: Amir"
