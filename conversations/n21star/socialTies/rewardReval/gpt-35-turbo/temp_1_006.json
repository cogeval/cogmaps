Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Initialize a queue with Amir as the starting point.\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the scholars we have visited.\n3. Create a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n4. Create an empty path list to store the shortest path.\n5. Start the BFS algorithm:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is not in the visited set:\n      - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n      - Check if the scholar has donated books. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum books.\n      - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar.\n      - Update the path list with the current scholar.\n   c.
