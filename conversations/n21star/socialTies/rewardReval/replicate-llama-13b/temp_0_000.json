Here is a sample input to the computer:\nuser: Sara Amiri\nAI assistant: Sara, Amiri, Pari, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\nAI assistant: Prem is donation 50 books and Moin is donated 10 books. First letter Amir with Sara, then Kimm Ia Wei Ian, Nisha and Jing, Moin and Ian, Puja and Kimm, Wiss and Kimm, Weih and Nisha, Nisha and Wei, Nisha and Amir, then Eee Emaw.\nYou will provide the computer with the output according to its input.\nNote that you should not take books from scholars who have donated one book each, i.e. Moin or Wei."
