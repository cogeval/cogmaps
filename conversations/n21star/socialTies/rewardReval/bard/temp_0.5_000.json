Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We can find the shortest path to Amy using a breadth-first search algorithm. We start by adding Amir to the queue. We then repeatedly remove the first scholar from the queue and add any scholars that are connected to it to the queue. We continue this process until we reach Amy.\n\nIn this case, we will first add Amir to the queue. We then remove Amir from the queue and add Raj to the queue. We then remove Raj from the queue and add Jing to the queue. We then remove Jing from the queue and add Eva to the queue. We then remove Eva from the queue and add Amy to the queue.\n\nWe do not need to add any other scholars to the queue because Amy is the only scholar that is connected to Eva.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is **Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amy**.\n\nHowever, if Moin donates 49 books instead of 10 books, then the maximum number of books among all the scholars will be 31. The scholars with 31 books are Amy, Pari, and Raj.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Amy is still **Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amy**.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Pari is **Amir, Raj, Jing, Pari**.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Raj is **Amir, Raj**.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question depends on who you want Amir to get books from. If you want Amir to get books from the person with the maximum number of books, then the answer is **Amir, Raj, Jing, Eva, Amy**. If you want Amir to get books from the person with the most books that is connected to him, then the answer is **Amir, Raj, Jing, Pari**. And if you want Amir to get books from the person with the most books that is directly connected to him, then the answer is **Amir, Raj**."
