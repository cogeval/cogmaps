Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We know that Amir is connected with Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Prem is the scholar who is donating the maximum number of books, 50 books. Let's trace a path to him from Amir.\n\nHere are the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wei.\n2. Wei is connected to Eva.\n3. Eva is connected to Matt.\n4. Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem. \n\nThis is the quickest way for Amir to get to the person donating the most books, which is Prem. \n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, considering that you can take books from only one person, would be Amir to Wei, Wei to Eva, Eva to Matt, and finally Matt to Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
