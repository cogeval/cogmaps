Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Looking at the scholars connected to Amir, Nisha appears to have a direct link to Reza. Reza is then linked to Wim, who is connected to Jing. Jing has a direct connection to Pam. Pam is connected to Kim. Kim is linked to Ian, who has a direct link to Puja. Puja is linked to Pari. Pari has a connection with Amy and Amy is connected to Matt. Finally, Matt has a direct connection to Prem. \n\nStep 4: If the shortest path to Moin were needed, that path would be through Puja then Ian.\n\nStep 5: The shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) from Amir is Amir -> Nisha -> Reza -> Wim -> Jing -> Pam -> Kim -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nStep 6: List the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem"

Looking at the scholars connected to Amir, none of them appears to have a direct link to Moin. Thus, we need to traverse the network of connections further.\n\nStep 3: Looking into the network, we find that Amir is connected to Sara through Raj and Wei. Sara is then directly connected to Moin.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Moin) is Amir -> Raj -> Wei -> Sara -> Moin.\n\nStep 5: List the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Sara, Moin"
