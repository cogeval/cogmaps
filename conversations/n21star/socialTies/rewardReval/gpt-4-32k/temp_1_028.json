Upon reviewing the connections, we see that Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy, but none of these people are in Amir's direct connections.\n\nNext, we check the connections of people Amir is connected to. Amir is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Eva. Eva, in turn, is connected to Prem, who has the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is through Wei and Eva.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

From the data given, none of the scholars Amir is directly connected to (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza) is directly connected to Moin.\n\nNow, we check the second-degree connections. Nisha and Reza are connected to Pam and Pam is connected to Moin, who has the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is through Nisha or Reza, then Pam.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Pam, Moin"
