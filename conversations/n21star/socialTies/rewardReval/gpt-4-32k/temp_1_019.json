Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books. \n\nNext, I will find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nFrom the connections stated:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nIf we observe carefully, Zack is the only scholar directly connected with Prem. So we need to find a path from Amir to Zack.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. \n\nEva is connected to Zack through Matt. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem would be: Amir -> Nisha -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Zack -> Prem.\n\nThis path connects Amir to the scholar who has the maximum number of books (Prem) in the least number of steps.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Prem."
