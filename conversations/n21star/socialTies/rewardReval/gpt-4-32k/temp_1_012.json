Therefore, Prem is the scholar with the maximum books.\n\nStep 2: Map out the connections from Amir to Prem. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. We need to find a path from these scholars to Prem.\n\nStep 3: Based on the given connections, we can draw a path from Amir to Prem through Raj. Raj is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Eva. Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is finally connected to Prem.\n\nStep 4: List the scholar names in order, from Amir to the scholar with the most books (Prem), separated by commas. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"
