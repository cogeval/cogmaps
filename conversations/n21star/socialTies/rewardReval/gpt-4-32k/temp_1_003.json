Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

But none of them are directly connected to Prem.\n\nThe second scholar Amir is connected to is Wei, who is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is directly connected to Matt, Amy, Gia, and Prem. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem.\n\nHence, the list of scholar names in order from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
