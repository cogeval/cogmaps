Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

It's given that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books, so the target person is Prem. Let's start by looking at the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. From the given connections, none of Amir's connections link directly to Prem. \n\nNext, find connections of Amir's network:\n\n1. Wim is connected to Jing.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n3. Jing isn't connected to anyone.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nBased on these, the next step is to find a link to Zack, since Zack is connected to Prem, from Amir's network:\n\n1. Wei is the only person who is connected to someone outside Amir's network, that is Eva. \n2. But Eva is not connected to Zack either. \n\nSince we can't connect to Zack from Amir's network, let's find a connection from Sara's and Zack's network:\n\n1. Zack's network is Amy, Eva, Gia, Matt, Ming, and Prem.\n2. Amy and Matt are connected to Eva. \n3. Eva is connected to Wei from Amir's network.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, Prem, is through Wei and Eva.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
