Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem.\n\nNext, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nLooking at the connections, I can see that Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nFrom these, I need to find a connection to Prem:\n\n- Wim is connected to Jing but no connection to Prem.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim but no connection to Prem.\n- Jing has no connections to Prem.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Matt, who is connected to Prem. So one path from Amir could be Amir-Wei-Eva-Matt-Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei but no direct connection to Prem.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing but no connection to Prem.\n\nFrom the analysis, the shortest path is Amir-Wei-Eva-Matt-Prem. \n\nSo, the answer is \"Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem\". \n\nLet's provide this in the required format. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"
