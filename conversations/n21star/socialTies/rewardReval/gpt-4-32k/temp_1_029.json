Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this scenario, Prem has 50 books and Moin has 10 books, so the person with the most books is Prem.\n\nNext, we have to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nLooking at the relationships, we see that Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nStarting with Wim: Wim is connected to Jing. Jing is not connected to Prem.\n\nStarting with Raj: Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. None of them lead to Prem. \n\nStarting with Jing: Jing is not connected to Prem. \n\nStarting with Wei: Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Matt and Prem. \n\nStarting with Nisha: Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of them lead to Prem.\n\nStarting with Reza: Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of them lead to Prem.\n\nSo, we can see that the shortest path from Amir to Prem is through Wei to Eva, and then to Prem.\n\nSo the names in order would be Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Thus, we need to find a scholar who is connected to both Amir's and Moin's networks. \n\nIf we check Sara's network, we see that she is connected to Moin and also Amir's network via Pam, who is connected to Jing. Jing is in Amir's network.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara, Moin"
