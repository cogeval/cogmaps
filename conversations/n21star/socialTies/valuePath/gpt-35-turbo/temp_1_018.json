Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n4. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n6. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n7. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n8. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n9. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n10. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n11. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n12. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n13. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n14. Puja is connected to Pari.\n15. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n16. Wim is connected to Jing.\n17. Pari is connected to Amy.\n18. Amy is connected to Matt.\n19. Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nBased on the information above, the scholars who have donated books are:\n- Prem: 50 books\n- Moin: 10 books\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, we will check Amir's connections to other scholars who have donated books.\n2. Since Amir is connected to Reza, who is not a book donor, we will explore Amir's other connections.\n3. Amir is also connected to Nisha, who is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Among these connections, Wim has the maximum number of books (unknown at this point).\n4. Now we need to find the connections of Wim. Wim is only connected to Jing, who is not a book donor.\n5. We will explore the connections of Jing next.\n6. Jing is connected to Reza, who is not a book donor.\n7. The connections of Reza have already been explored, so we move to the next connection of Jing, which is Wei.\n8. Wei is connected to Eva, who is also not a book donor.\n9. Since there are no more connections from Jing, we need to explore the connections of Wim.\n10. Wim is connected to Jing, who we have already explored, so there are no new connections.\n11. Since we have reached a dead-end, we will backtrack to the previous step and explore the connections of Nisha.\n12. Nisha is connected to Reza, who we have already explored.\n13. Moving to Nisha's next connection, we find Raj.\n14. Raj is connected to Jing, who we have already explored.\n15. Raj's next connection is Wei.\n16. Wei is connected to Eva, who we have already explored.\n17. Since there are no more connections from Raj, we backtrack again to Nisha.\n18. Nisha's final connection is Wei.\n19. Wei is connected to Eva, who we have already explored.\n20. Since there are no more connections from Nisha, we backtrack to Amir.\n21. Amir's final connection is Wei.\n22. Since Wei has been explored and is not a book donor, we cannot find a shorter path from Amir to a person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir"
