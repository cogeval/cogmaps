Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who have donated books. Among those scholars, find the one with the maximum number of books.\n3. If there is such a scholar, the shortest path ends here. Return the list of scholars visited in the order they were encountered, starting with Amir and ending with the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n4. If there is no scholar connected to Amir who has donated books, expand the search to the scholars connected to Amir's connections. Add these scholars to the search queue.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a scholar with donated books is found or the search queue is empty.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them have donated books.\n3. Expand the search to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Among them, Nisha has donated books. The shortest path ends here.\n5. Return the list of scholars visited: Amir, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha"
