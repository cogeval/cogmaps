Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Then, we will find the person with the maximum number of books and determine the shortest path from Amir to that person. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the scholars and their connections:\n   - Create a dictionary where each scholar is a key, and the connected scholars are stored as values.\n\n2. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark Amir as visited.\n\n3. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books. Set the maximum number of books to 0 and the scholar with the maximum number of books to None.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the number of books connected to the current scholar is greater than the maximum number of books, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar and mark them as visited.\n\n5. Starting from Amir, use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and find the shortest path to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the previous scholar for each scholar.\n   - Initialize a variable to store the current scholar and set it to Amir.\n   - While the current scholar is not the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n     - Get the next scholar in the shortest path by getting the previous scholar from the dictionary.\n     - Add the current scholar to the list of scholars in the shortest path.\n     - Set the next scholar as the current scholar.\n\n6. Finally, print the list of scholars in the shortest path, including Amir.\n\nNow let's proceed with the implementation."
