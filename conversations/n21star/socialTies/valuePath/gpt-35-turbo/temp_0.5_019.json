Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will also assign the number of books donated by each scholar as weights on the edges.\n\nLet's summarize the connections and the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\nSara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\nZack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\nPam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\nMing is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\nKim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari.\nGia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\nReza is connected to Wim and Jing.\nPuja is connected to scholar Pari.\nPrem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\nWim is connected to Jing.\nPari is connected to Amy.\nAmy is connected to Matt.\nMatt is connected to Eva.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books by finding the maximum number of books donated among the connections of Amir's connections.\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Among these connections, Nisha has a connection with the maximum number of books (0 books).\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha"
