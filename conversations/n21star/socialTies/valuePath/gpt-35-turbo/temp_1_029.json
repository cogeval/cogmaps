Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n2. Among Amir's connections, check who has the maximum number of books. We don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books at this point.\n\n3. Continue exploring the connections of Amir's connections. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\n4. Among Wim's connections, check who has the maximum number of books. We don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books at this point.\n\n5. Continue exploring the connections of Wim's connections. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Raj, and Wim.\n\n6. Among Jing's connections, check who has the maximum number of books. We don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books at this point.\n\n7. Continue exploring the connections of Jing's connections. Wei is connected to Reza and Wim.\n\n8. Among Wei's connections, check who has the maximum number of books. We don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books at this point.\n\n9. Continue exploring the connections of Wei's connections. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n\n10. Among Reza's connections, check who has the maximum number of books. We don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books at this point.\n\n11. We have reached a dead end as we have explored all the connections of the scholars. Since we don't have information about the number of books each scholar has, we cannot determine the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: The shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books cannot be determined without information about the number of books each scholar has."
