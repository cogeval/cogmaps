Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Among these scholars, we do not have any information about their book donations. Therefore, we need to explore further.\n\nFrom the given connections, we know that Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Among these scholars, we only have information about Wei's book donation, which is connected to Eva. However, Eva is not the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we move to the scholars connected to Nisha. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Among these, we only have information about Wei's book donation, which is connected to Eva. But again, Eva is not the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's check the scholars connected to Raj. Jing is connected to Wim, and we have no information about his book donation. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. From these connections, we know that Eva has a book donation. However, we still need to find out if there is someone else with more books.\n\nSince we have no other scholars connected to Wei, we move on to the scholars connected to Eva. From the given connections, we know that Eva is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Prem, who is donating 50 books. Thus, we have found the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Nisha, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt"
