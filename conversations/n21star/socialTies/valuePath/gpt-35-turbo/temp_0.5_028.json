Then, we can choose the scholar with the minimum distance as the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nFirst, let's identify the scholars who have the books:\n\n- Prem is donating 50 books.\n- Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance between Amir and each of these scholars:\n\n- Prem is connected to Ming, Gia, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance between Amir and each of the scholars connected to Prem:\n\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. (Distance: 1)\n- Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Ming. (Distance: 1)\n- Matt is connected to Prem, Eva, Amy, Ming, and Gia. (Distance: 2)\n- Eva is connected to Prem, Matt, Amy, Ming, and Gia. (Distance: 2)\n- Amy is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Ming, and Gia. (Distance: 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance between Amir and each of the scholars connected to Moin:\n\n- Puja is connected to Moin, Pari, Kim, and Ian. (Distance: 1)\n- Pari is connected to Moin, Puja, Kim, and Ian. (Distance: 1)\n- Kim is connected to Moin, Ian, Puja, and Pari. (Distance: 2)\n- Ian is connected to Moin, Puja, Pari, and Kim. (Distance: 2)\n\nBased on the distances calculated, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAmir, Ming\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Amir, Ming"
