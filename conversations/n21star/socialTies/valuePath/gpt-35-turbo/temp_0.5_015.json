Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 5-8.\n\n5. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n\n6. If the scholar has the maximum number of books, stop the search and return the path.\n\n7. If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue their connected scholars.\n\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given information, let's calculate the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva"
