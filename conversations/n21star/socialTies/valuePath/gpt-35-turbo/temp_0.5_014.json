Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n2. Create a dictionary to keep track of the visited scholars and their distances from Amir.\n3. Initialize the queue with Amir and set his distance to 0.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar (excluding the visited ones) and update their distances in the dictionary.\n5. If the search completes without finding a scholar with the maximum number of books, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Wei, Eva, Amy, Matt, Prem"
