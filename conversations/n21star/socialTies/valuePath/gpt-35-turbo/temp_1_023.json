Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will traverse the graph using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Create a graph with scholars as nodes and the number of books as weights on the edges, based on the given connections and donations.\n\n2. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add Amir to the visited set.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n    a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n    b. If the scholar has more books than the current maximum, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n    c. Enqueue all the connected scholars who have not been visited yet.\n    d. Add the scholar to the visited set.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 until the queue is empty.\n\n5. The scholar with the maximum number of books will be the final outcome.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva"
