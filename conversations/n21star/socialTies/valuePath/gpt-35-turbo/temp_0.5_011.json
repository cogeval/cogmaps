Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will start from Amir and explore the connections to other scholars, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize a variable max_books to 0 and a variable max_books_scholar to an empty string.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Check if the scholar has donated more books than max_books. If so, update max_books and max_books_scholar.\n   - Enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty.\n6. The scholar with the maximum number of books will be stored in the variable max_books_scholar.\n\nNow let's follow the steps and find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva"
