Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir\n2. Wim (connected to Amir): No books donated\n3. Reza (connected to Wim): No books donated\n4. Jing (connected to Reza): No books donated\n5. Wei (connected to Jing): No books donated\n6. Eva (connected to Wei): No books donated\n7. Matt (connected to Eva): No books donated\n8. Amy (connected to Matt): No books donated\n9. Gia (connected to Amy): No books donated\n10. Ming (connected to Gia): No books donated\n11. Prem (connected to Ming): 50 books donated (Maximum)\n12. Pari (connected to Prem): No books donated\n13. Puja (connected to Pari): No books donated\n14. Kim (connected to Puja): No books donated\n15. Ian (connected to Kim): No books donated\n16. Moin (connected to Ian): 10 books donated\n17.
