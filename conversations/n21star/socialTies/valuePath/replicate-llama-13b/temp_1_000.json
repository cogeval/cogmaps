Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The shortest path is from \nAnswer Explained: From  Amir, We go through his connections first, reaching Wim, Next by going through the links connected with Wim we attained three scholars- JiNg, Reza,  and evasion; after then reaching Ev as per Wym is connection with her, Moving toward s Eva to gain prem And matt, Next step at Prem s connection lies; we move toward prem connections to eva,am and mo; we can choose one among them i.e Am. Hence Amir the way reaching is as Matt, Eva, Am, Next the order is we followed, to reach jing Reaza jings as connection 5scholar and as she is having the largest no, that makes way To come Jing.\nNote as we just can take or chose one Person on our shortest-lived Path.
