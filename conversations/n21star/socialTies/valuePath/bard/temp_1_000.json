Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "Sure, here is the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, Prem:\n\n```\nAmir, Raj, Jing, Prem\n```\n\nThis path has a length of 3, and Prem is the person with the maximum number of books (50).\n\nTo find this path, I first created a graph of the relationships between the scholars. Each scholar was represented by a node, and each connection between scholars was represented by an edge. I then used a shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the node representing Prem.\n\nThe regular expression you provided is:\n\n```\nAnswer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches a string that starts with the word \"Answer:\", followed by a comma-separated list of words. The following is the output of the regular expression applied to the list of scholars in the shortest path:\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Jing, Prem\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n**However, I noticed that you mentioned that Moin is donating 10 books. If you want to take books from Moin instead of Prem, the shortest path would be:**\n\n```\nAmir, Moin\n```\n\nThis path has a length of 2, and Moin is the person with the second-highest number of books (10)."
