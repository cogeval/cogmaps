Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Among them, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Prem, we have to look at their connections. Let's start with Amir:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. None of these scholars is directly connected to Prem. We have to look further.\n3. Among Amir's connections, Nisha is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Reza.\n4. None of these scholars is connected to Prem either.\n5. Among Amir's connections, Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n6. Eva is directly connected to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books (Prem) is Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."
