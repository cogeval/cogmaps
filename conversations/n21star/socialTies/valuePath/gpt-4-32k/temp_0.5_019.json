Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books. Prem has the maximum number of books (50).\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. Amir is not directly connected to Prem, so we need to find a path through the scholars that Amir is connected to.\n\nLooking at the connections, we can see that Amir is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Eva. Eva is connected to Prem. So, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is through Wei and Eva.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order, starting from Amir, are Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
