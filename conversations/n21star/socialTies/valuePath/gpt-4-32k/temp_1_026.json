Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "Firstly, I recognize that this question is asking about a social network among scholars and the shortest path from one person to another. Let's find out the scholars who are donating books.\n\nPrem is donating 50 books, and Moin is donating 10 books. So, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's look at the shortest path from Amir to Prem:\n\n- Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them is Prem. We need to look for indirect connections.\n\n- Wim is connected to Jing. Again, Jing is not Prem. We can move to the next connection.\n\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. None of them is Prem. Move to the next connection.\n\n- Jing is connected to Wei, Wim, Raj, and Reza. None of them is Prem. Move to the next connection.\n\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. None of them is Prem. Move to the next connection.\n\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of them is Prem. Move to the next connection.\n\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Again, none of them is Prem. So, we continue to the second layer of connections from Amir.\n\n- We start with Wim who is connected to Jing. Jing is then connected to Wei and Raj. Wei is connected to Eva, but Eva is not Prem. \n\n- Raj is directly connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Again none of them is Prem. \n\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of them is directly linked to Prem.\n\n- Finally, Wei, who is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, leads us to a pathway. Eva is connected to Matt, Amy and Gia, who is also directly connected to Prem.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Gia, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Gia, Prem."
