Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will ignore any person that we have already visited. Among Amir's connections, Wim only connects to Jing (already in our list), Raj connects to Jing and Wei (already in our list), Jing is a connection for many but is already in our list, Wei connects to Reza and Eva (Eva is a new addition), Nisha connects to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei (all already in our list), and Reza connects to Wim, and Jing (both already in our list).\n\nWe add Eva to our list. Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, and Gia. Matt and Amy are new additions. \n\nMatt is connected to Eva and Amy (already in our list). Amy is connected to Matt and Prem. Prem is a new addition, and importantly, Prem is the person who has the most books.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem (the person with the maximum number of books) is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Amy, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Amy, Prem"
