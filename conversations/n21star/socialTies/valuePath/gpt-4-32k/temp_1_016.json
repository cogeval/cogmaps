Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, first, we identify who has the maximum number of books. In this case, it's Prem with 50 books. Then we analyze the network starting from Amir to reach Prem.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Among these scholars, none of them have a direct connection with Prem. So, we need to look for a second degree of connection.\n\nAnalyzing the second degree of connections from Amir, through Raj we can reach Jing and Wei. None of them are connected to Prem. Through Wei, we can connect to Eva, but she is not directly connected to Prem. Through Wim, we can reach Jing, but she is also not directly connected to Prem. Through Nisha, we can reach Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, but none of them are connected to Prem.\n\nComing to Reza, he is connected to Wim and Jing. Neither of them are directly connected to Prem. Therefore, so far, no direct or second degree connection with Prem from Amir.\n\nNext, let's consider Zack's connections since Zack is directly connected to Prem. Zack is directly connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Ming is connected to Prem and also to Amy, Gia, Matt, and Eva. Here, Amy is connected to Matt. Therefore, Amir can reach Prem through the following path: Amir to Reza, Reza to Zack, Zack to Ming, Ming to Amy, and Amy to Prem.\n\nFinally, the scholar names in order from Amir to Prem are:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Zack, Ming, Amy, Prem."
