If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Amy.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Amy. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the connection to Amy.\n5. If not, move to the next level of connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Amy is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Amir is not directly connected to Amy.\n2. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing.\n4. Jing is connected to Wei.\n5. Wei is connected to Eva.\n6. Eva is connected to Amy.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Amy is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Amy.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Amy"
