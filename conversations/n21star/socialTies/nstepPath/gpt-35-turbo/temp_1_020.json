Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. From Reza what is the shortest path to Pari?

Start from Reza and check if Pari is directly connected to Reza. If yes, the path is Reza, Pari.\n2. If Pari is not directly connected to Reza, check Reza's connections (Wim and Jing) to see if they are connected to Pari.\n3. If any of Reza's connections are connected to Pari, choose the shortest path and append it to the current path. For example, if Wim is connected to Pari, the path becomes Reza, Wim, Pari.\n4. If neither Reza nor Reza's connections are connected to Pari, repeat step 3 for the connections of Reza's connections (Wim, Raj, and Wei), until Pari is found or all possible paths are exhausted.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Reza to Pari:\n\n1. Reza -> Wim -> Pari (path: Reza, Wim, Pari)\n2. Reza -> Raj -> Wei -> Pari (path: Reza, Raj, Wei, Pari)\n\nSince the second path is shorter, the shortest path from Reza to Pari is: Reza, Raj, Wei, Pari.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Raj, Wei, Pari"
