Check if Wei is directly connected to Sara. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Sara.\n3. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Sara. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the directly connected scholar, Sara.\n4. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholars who are connected to other scholars that are directly connected to Sara. Repeat this step until a connection to Sara is found.\n5. If no connection to Sara is found, there is no path from Wei to Sara.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Wei is directly connected to Eva. Check if Eva is directly connected to Sara.\n2. Eva is not directly connected to Sara.\n3. Eva is connected to Matt. Check if Matt is directly connected to Sara.\n4. Matt is not directly connected to Sara.\n5. Matt is connected to Amy. Check if Amy is directly connected to Sara.\n6. Amy is connected to Pari. Check if Pari is directly connected to Sara.\n7. Pari is directly connected to Sara.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Sara is Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara"
