Starting from Pam, we check if Pam is connected to Ming directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Pam, Ming.\n2. If Pam is not connected to Ming directly, we create a queue and add Pam to the queue.\n3. We also create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, we perform the following steps:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_scholar\".\n   - Check if \"current_scholar\" is Ming. If yes, we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n   - If not, we iterate through the scholars connected to \"current_scholar\" and check if they have been visited.\n   - If a connected scholar has not been visited, we add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n5. If the queue becomes empty without finding Ming, it means there is no path from Pam to Ming.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm:\n\n1. Start from Pam.\n2. Add Pam to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. Remove Pam from the queue and assign it to \"current_scholar\".\n4. Check if \"current_scholar\" is Ming. No.\n5.
