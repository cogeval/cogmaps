Expand the connections of Amir, which are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Expand the connections of each of these scholars, keeping track of the path taken.\n   - For Wim: His connections are Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n   - For Raj: His connections are Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - For Jing: His connections are Wei, Reza, Wim, and Pam.\n   - For Wei: His connections are Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - For Nisha: Her connections are Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - For Reza: His connections are Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Continue expanding the connections of the scholars in the previous step, making sure to avoid revisiting scholars already encountered.\n   - For Eva: Her connections are Wei, Prem, Matt, Amy, Ming, and Gia.\n   - For Pam: Her connections are Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n   - For Puja: Her connections are scholars Pari, Moin, Kim, and Ian.\n   - For Matt: His connections are Eva, Amy, Prem, Ming, and Gia.\n   - For Amy: Her connections are Matt, Eva, and Pari.\n5. Repeat the process until Amy is reached. In this case, the shortest path from Amir to Amy is:\n   Answer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Amy."
