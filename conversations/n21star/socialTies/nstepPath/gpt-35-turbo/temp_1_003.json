We will continue exploring the connections of each visited scholar until we reach Amy. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be visited. Add Wim to the queue.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the visited scholars.\n3. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_scholar\".\n   - Check if the \"current_scholar\" is Amy. If yes, stop the loop.\n   - Otherwise, add the \"current_scholar\" to the list of visited scholars.\n   - Get the connections of the \"current_scholar\".\n   - Add the unvisited connections to the queue.\n4. Once the loop is stopped, the shortest path from Wim to Amy is the list of visited scholars.\n5. Convert the list to a string, separating the scholar names by commas.\n6. Add Wim to the beginning of the string.\n7. Provide the final outcome using the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+'.\n\nApplying these steps to the given information, the shortest path from Wim to Amy is:\n\nWim, Jing, Pam, Moin, Pari, Amy\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Moin, Pari, Amy"
