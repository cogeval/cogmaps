Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Since Pari is not directly connected to Amir, we need to explore the connections further.\n4. Move to Wim (Amir's connection).\n5. Check Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n6. Since Pari is not directly connected to Wim, we need to explore the connections further.\n7. Move to Jing (Wim's connection).\n8. Check Jing's connections: Wei, Reza, Pam, and Kim.\n9. Since Pari is not directly connected to Jing, we need to explore the connections further.\n10. Move to Wei (Jing's connection).\n11. Check Wei's connections: Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n12. Since Pari is not directly connected to Wei, we need to explore the connections further.\n13. Move to Reza (Wei's connection).\n14.
