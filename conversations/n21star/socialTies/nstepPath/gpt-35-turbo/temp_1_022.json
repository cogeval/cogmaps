Starting with Pam, we will create a queue to keep track of the scholars to visit.\n2. Initialize a visited set to store the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Add Pam to the queue and mark her as visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar is Eva. If yes, the shortest path has been found, and we can stop.\n   - If the scholar is not Eva, add all of their unvisited connections to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. If we reach this point, it means there is no path from Pam to Eva in the given connections.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Moin, Puja, Ian, Eva"
