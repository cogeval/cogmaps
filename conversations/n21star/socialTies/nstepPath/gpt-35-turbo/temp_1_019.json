Check if Nisha is connected to Amy directly. If yes, the shortest path is just Nisha, Amy. Answer: Nisha, Amy.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n4. Check each connection if they are connected to Amy directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, the connection, Amy.\n5. If not, move to the connections of Nisha's connections and check if they are connected to Amy directly.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Amy is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Nisha to Amy:\n\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Reza is not connected to Amy.\n- Wim is connected to Eva, who is connected to Amy. The shortest path is Nisha, Wim, Eva, Amy. Answer: Nisha, Wim, Eva, Amy.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Nisha to Amy is Nisha, Wim, Eva, Amy."
