Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. From Jing what is the shortest path to Amy?

Check if Jing is directly connected to Amy. If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Amy.\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Amy, check the scholars connected to Jing.\n4. Among the scholars connected to Jing, check if any of them is directly connected to Amy. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, followed by the directly connected scholar, and then Amy.\n5. If none of the scholars connected to Jing is directly connected to Amy, repeat step 4 for each of the scholars connected to Jing's connections. Keep track of the path taken so far.\n6. Continue this process until Amy is found or until all possible paths have been explored.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Amy:\n\nStarting with Jing, the scholars connected to Jing are Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim. None of them is directly connected to Amy. \n\nNext, we will check the scholars connected to Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim. \n\nWei is connected to Eva, Reza, and Wim. Eva is directly connected to Amy, so the shortest path from Jing to Amy is: \nJing, Wei, Eva, Amy.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Jing to Amy is:\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Eva, Amy"
