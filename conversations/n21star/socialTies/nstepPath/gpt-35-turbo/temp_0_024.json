Check Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check the connections of each of Pam's connections:\n   - For Jing, the connections are Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim.\n   - For Kim, the connections are Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n   - For Ian, the connections are Puja and Pari.\n   - For Moin, the connections are Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n   - For Puja, the connections are Pari, Moin, Kim, and Ian.\n4. Check the connections of each of the above connections:\n   - For Wei, the connections are Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - For Raj, the connections are Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - For Reza, the connections are Wim and Jing.\n   - For Wim, the connection is Jing.\n   - For Pari, the connection is Amy.\n   - For Amy, the connection is Matt.\n   - For Matt, the connection is Eva.\n   - For Eva, the connection is Gia.\n5. Gia is found.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pam to Gia is: Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Gia.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Gia"
