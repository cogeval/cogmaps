Check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Among these connections, check if Pari is present. If yes, the shortest path is found and we can stop here.\n4. If Pari is not found, add the connections of Amir to a queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wim) and check their connections: Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n6. Among these connections, check if Pari is present. If yes, the shortest path is found and we can stop here.\n7. If Pari is not found, add the connections of Wim to the end of the queue: Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Pari is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's perform the breadth-first search to find the shortest path from Amir to Pari:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva, Amy, Pari"
