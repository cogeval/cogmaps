Check if Pam is connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Matt.\n3. If not, check all the scholars connected to Pam (Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja).\n4. Add these scholars to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Jing) and check if they are connected to Matt.\n6. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, Jing, and Matt.\n7. If not, add all the scholars connected to Jing (Wei, Reza, Wim, and Eva) to the queue.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 until Matt is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing this algorithm, the shortest path from Pam to Matt is Pam, Jing, Wei, Eva, and Matt.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt"
