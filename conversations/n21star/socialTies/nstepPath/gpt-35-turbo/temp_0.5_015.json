If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Puja.\n3. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholars who are directly connected to Puja. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the directly connected scholar, Puja.\n4. If not, check if Wei is connected to any scholars who are connected to scholars who are directly connected to Puja. Repeat this step until a connection is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n5. If a connection is found, list the scholars in the order they are visited, starting from Wei.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\nStarting from Wei, Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. None of them are directly connected to Puja. \n\nNext, Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Wim is connected to Puja, so the shortest path from Wei to Puja is Wei, Reza, Wim, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Reza, Wim, Puja"
