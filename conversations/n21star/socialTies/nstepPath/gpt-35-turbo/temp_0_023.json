Check Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check their connections: Jing's connections are Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim. Kim's connections are Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian's connections are Puja and Pari. Moin's connections are Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Puja's connections are scholars Pari. \n4. Check the connections of the scholars we found in step 3: Wei's connections are Reza, Wim, and Eva. Raj's connections are Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Reza's connections are Wim and Jing. Wim's connection is Jing. Eva's connections are Matt. Pari's connections are Amy. \n5. Check the connections of the scholars we found in step 4: Matt's connection is Eva.\n6. Since we have found Matt, we can stop the search.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pam to Matt is: Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt"
