Check if Jing is connected to Prem. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, Prem.\n3. If not, check if Jing is connected to any scholar who is connected to Prem. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, connected scholar, Prem.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each scholar connected to Jing.\n5. If there are no more connected scholars to check, then there is no path from Jing to Prem.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Jing to Prem:\n\n1. Jing is connected to Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim. None of them are directly connected to Prem.\n2. Wei is connected to Eva, who is connected to Prem. So the shortest path is Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem"
