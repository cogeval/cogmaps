Look at Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check if any of these connections are Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, followed by Eva.\n4. If Eva is not found, continue to the next level of connections.\n5. For each connection at the next level, check their connections.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until Eva is found.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Pam to Eva:\n\nLevel 1: Pam\nLevel 2: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nLevel 3: Eva\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Eva"
