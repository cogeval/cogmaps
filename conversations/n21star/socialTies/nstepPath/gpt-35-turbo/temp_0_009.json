Check if Jing is connected to Prem. If yes, the shortest path is just Jing and Prem.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing and add them to a queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue and check if they are connected to Prem. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, the current scholar, and Prem.\n5. If not, add the connections of the current scholar to the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Prem is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Jing.\n2. Jing is not connected to Prem.\n3. Add the connections of Jing (Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim) to the queue.\n4. Take Wei from the queue.\n5. Wei is not connected to Prem.\n6. Add Wei's connections (Reza, Wim, Eva) to the queue.\n7. Take Raj from the queue.\n8. Raj is not connected to Prem.\n9. Add Raj's connections (Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim) to the queue.\n10. Take Reza from the queue.\n11. Reza is not connected to Prem.\n12. Add Reza's connections (Wim, Jing) to the queue.\n13. Take Wim from the queue.\n14. Wim is not connected to Prem.\n15. Add Wim's connection (Jing) to the queue.\n16. Take Eva from the queue.\n17. Eva is connected to Prem.\n18. The shortest path from Jing to Prem is: Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem"
