Return the scholar names in order.\n  - If no, enqueue the connected scholars (excluding those already visited) and mark them as visited.\n- If the queue becomes empty and Amy is not found, there is no path from Jing to Amy.\n\nFollowing the steps above, the shortest path from Jing to Amy is:\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Eva, Amy"
