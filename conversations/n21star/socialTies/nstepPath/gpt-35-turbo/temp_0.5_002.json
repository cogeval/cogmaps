Initialize an empty queue and add Wim to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty visited set and add Wim to the set.\n4. Initialize an empty parent dictionary to keep track of the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Remove the first node from the queue and assign it to the variable \"current_node\".\n   - If the current_node is Pari, stop the search and reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current_node that has not been visited, do the following steps:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the queue.\n     - Set the parent of the connected scholar as the current_node in the parent dictionary.\n6. If the search completes without finding Pari, there is no path from Wim to Pari.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from Wim to Pari:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Jing, Pam, Puja, Pari"
