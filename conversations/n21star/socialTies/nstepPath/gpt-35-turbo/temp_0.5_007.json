We will start from Jing and explore the connections of each scholar one by one until we reach Gia. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Jing.\n2. Check if Jing is connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, Gia.\n3. If not, check the connections of Jing: Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Check if any of these scholars are connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is Jing, [connected scholar], Gia.\n5. If not, check the connections of the scholars connected to Jing (Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim).\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Gia is found or all connections are explored.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Jing to Gia is:\n\nJing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Gia\n\nAnswer: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Gia"
