Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva\n3. Check if any of the connected scholars are Kim. If not, continue to the next step.\n4. Reza is not Kim, so explore Reza's connections: Wim and Jing\n5. Check if Wim is Kim. If not, continue to the next step.\n6. Wim is not Kim, so explore Wim's connections: Jing\n7. Check if Jing is Kim. If not, continue to the next step.\n8. Jing is not Kim, so explore Jing's connections: Raj, Wei, and Reza\n9. Check if any of the connected scholars are Kim. If not, continue to the next step.\n10. Raj is not Kim, so explore Raj's connections: Jing, Wei, and Reza\n11. Check if any of the connected scholars are Kim. If not, continue to the next step.\n12.
