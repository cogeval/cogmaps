Initialize an empty queue and an empty visited set.\n2. Add Jing to the queue and mark Jing as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n    - If the dequeued scholar is Ming, we have found the shortest path. Return the path from Jing to Ming.\n    - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar who have not been visited yet.\n    - Mark all the enqueued scholars as visited and set their parent as the dequeued scholar.\n4. If we finish the while loop without finding Ming, there is no path from Jing to Ming.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Jing to Ming:\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Moin, Gia, Ming"
