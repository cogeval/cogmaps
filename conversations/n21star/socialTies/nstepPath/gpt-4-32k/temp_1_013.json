Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing, Wim is connected to Jing, and Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, Gia, and Prem. \n\nFrom these connections, none of these scholars are connected to Ian directly.\n\nMoving to the next level, we need to explore the connections of Wim, Jing, Matt, Amy, Gia, and Prem.\n\n- Wim is connected to Jing only.\n- Jing is connected to Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza, Wim, and Pam.\n- Matt is connected to Eva, Zack, and Prem.\n- Amy is connected to Matt, Gia, Ming, Prem, and Pari.\n- Gia is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Ming, and Prem.\n- Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, and Ming.\n\nAgain, none of these scholars are directly connected to Ian, so we have to dive deeper.\n\nNow we need to explore the connections of Wei, Raj, Nisha, Reza, Zack, Ming, and Pari.\n\n- Wei has already been visited.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Reza has already been visited.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n- Pari is connected to Amy, Puja, Moin, Sara, and Kim.\n\nFrom Pari's connections, we can see that Kim is connected to Ian. This is the shortest path from Wei to Ian.\n\nSo the shortest path from Wei to Ian is: Wei, Eva, Amy, Pari, Kim, Ian.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Amy, Pari, Kim, Ian"
