Let's consider all the scholars Nisha is connected to - Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. \n\nNow let's check if any of these scholars are connected to Amy:\n1. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, but not Amy.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing, but not Amy.\n3. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but not Amy.\n4. Jing is not directly connected to Amy.\n5. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, but not Amy.\n\nNone of Nisha's connections lead directly to Amy, so we have to take another step.\n\nWe know from previous step, Raj, Wim and Wei are also connected to Reza, let's take Reza as the second step.\n\nReza is connected to Wim and Jing. Wim is further connected to Jing but not Amy. Jing is also not connected to Amy. Therefore, we are not able to reach Amy via Reza.\n\nNext, we check connections of Wei. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Reza and Wim do not lead us to Amy. Eva on the other hand, is connected to Matt and Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Nisha to Amy will be Nisha -> Wei -> Eva -> Amy.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Wei, Eva, Amy"
