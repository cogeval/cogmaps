Jing is connected to Raj, Wim, Reza, and Pam.\n\nNext, I will check each of these connections to see if any of them are directly connected to Ming. None of them are directly connected to Ming.\n\nThen I will check the connections of Raj, Wim, Reza, and Pam. Raj is connected to Wei. Wim has no further connections. Reza is connected to Wei. Pam is connected to Kim and Ian.\n\nNext, I will check the connections of Wei, Kim, and Ian. Wei is connected to Eva. Kim has no further connections. Ian is connected to Puja.\n\nThen, I will check the connections of Eva and Puja. Eva is connected to Matt and Amy. Puja is connected to Pari.\n\nNext, I will check the connections of Matt, Amy, and Pari. Matt is connected to Zack. Amy is connected to Prem. Pari has no further connections.\n\nThen, I will check the connections of Zack and Prem. Zack is connected to Ming. Prem is connected to Ming.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Ming is: Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Ming.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Ming."
