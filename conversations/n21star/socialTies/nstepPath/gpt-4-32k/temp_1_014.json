From Amir and Wim, none is directly connected to Moin but Amir is connected to Raj and Sara is connected to Moin but they don't have any connection. From Matt, Prem, and Gia, none is directly connected to Moin.\n4. However, Gia is connected to Zack, and Zack is directly connected to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Moin is: Wei, Eva, Gia, Zack, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Gia, Zack, Moin"
