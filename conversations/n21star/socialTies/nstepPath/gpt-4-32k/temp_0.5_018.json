Jing is not connected to any other scholars. Wei is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nEva is directly connected to Zack, Matt, Gia, and Prem. None of them are directly connected to Pari.\n\nGoing back to Nisha's connections, I'll consider the connections of Amir, Reza, Wim, and Raj again. \n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.
