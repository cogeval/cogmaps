So, we will need to find a sequence of scholars that links Reza to Pari.\n\nJing is connected with Raj, Wei, Nisha, and Pam. Pam is directly connected to Pari, so the shortest path from Reza to Pari is Reza -> Jing -> Pam -> Pari.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Reza to Pari is: Reza, Jing, Pam, Pari. \n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing, Pam, Pari."
