Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. \n\nStep 2: Check the connections of Raj's connected scholars. Jing and Wei have connections to Reza and Wim, but they are not connected to Amy. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, but not to Amy. Wim is only connected to Jing, and Jing is not connected to Amy. \n\nStep 3: From the available connections, Wei is the only scholar who has a connection outside of Raj's immediate connections, with Eva. \n\nStep 4: Eva is connected to Matt, Prem, and Amy. \n\nStep 5: From Eva, we can directly reach Amy. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Amy is: Raj, Wei, Eva, Amy.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Eva, Amy"
