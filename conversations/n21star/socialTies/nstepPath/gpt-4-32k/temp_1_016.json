As there are no direct connections, we then look for connections to Wei's connections. We follow this process until we find a connection to Sara.\n\nStep 1: Start from Wei. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nStep 2: Check connections of Reza, Wim, and Eva. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing. Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, Gia, Prem, and Ming. None of these is Sara or connected to Sara directly.\n\nStep 3: Check connections of Jing, Matt, Amy, Gia, Prem, and Ming. Jing is connected to Raj, Wim, Nisha, Wei and Pam. Matt is connected to Eva, Zack, Amy, and Prem. Amy is connected to Gia, Matt, Pari, and Prem. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Pam is connected to Sara. So we have found a connection to Sara through Pam.\n\nStep 4: Trace back from Pam to Wei, we get the path as Wei -> Jing -> Pam -> Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Jing, Pam, Sara"
