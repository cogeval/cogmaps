Thus, Wim is connected to Jing.\nStep 3: The connection between Jing and the next person has not been given, however, Amy is connected to Matt.\nStep 4: Considering that Amy can be reached from Matt, the connection from Jing to Matt must be found. After carefully reviewing the information, we learn that Ming is connected to Matt.\nStep 5: However, it's not stated that Jing is directly connected to Ming. Still, we see that Jing is connected to Raj.\nStep 6: Upon reviewing Raj's connections, we find that Raj is not connected to Ming or Matt. But, Raj is connected to Reza.\nStep 7: Checking Reza's connections, we don't find a direct link to Matt or Ming. But Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, which doesn't bring us closer to Matt.\nStep 8: Therefore, we need to find another route. We can observe that Amy can be reached via Pari. \nStep 9: Checking Pari's connections, we find that Puja is linked to Pari.\nStep 10: From the given connections, we can see that Sara is connected to Puja.\nStep 11: Also, it is stated that Amir is connected to Sara.\nStep 12: Finally, we find that Wim is connected to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Amy is Wim, Amir, Sara, Puja, Pari, Amy. \n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Sara, Puja, Pari, Amy."
