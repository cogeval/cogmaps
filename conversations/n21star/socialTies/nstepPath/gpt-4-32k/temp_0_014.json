Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing.\n4. Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, and Gia.\n\nNone of these scholars are directly connected to Moin, so we need to go one step further:\n\n5. Jing is connected to Raj, Wei, Nisha, and Pam.\n6.

Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\nFrom these connections, Pam and Pari are the only scholars who are connected to Moin. So, the shortest path from Wei to Moin could be either through Jing to Pam to Moin or through Eva to Amy to Pari to Moin.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Moin is: Wei, Reza, Jing, Pam, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Reza, Jing, Pam, Moin."
