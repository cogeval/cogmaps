Jing is directly connected to Raj, Wim, Wei, Reza, and Amir.\n3. Kim is directly connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n4. Ian is directly connected to Puja and Pari.\n5. Moin is directly connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n6. Puja is directly connected to Pari.\n\nFrom these connections, none of them are directly connected to Prem. So, we need to go one step further:\n\n1. Raj is directly connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n2. Wim is directly connected to Jing and Amir.\n3. Wei is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n4. Reza is directly connected to Wim, Jing, and Amir.\n5. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n6. Pari is directly connected to Amy.\n7. Amy is directly connected to Matt.\n8. Matt is directly connected to Eva and Prem.\n\nFrom these connections, we can see that the shortest path from Pam to Prem is: Pam -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem"
