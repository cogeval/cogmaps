Matt is connected to Eva (which we don't need to consider for the path) and Amy.\n3. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva (which we don't need to consider for the path), and Amy.\n4. Amy is connected to Matt and Pari.\n5. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva (which we don't need to consider for the path), and Amy.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Amy has a new connection to Pari.\n\n6. Pari is connected to Amy and Puja.\n7. Puja is connected to Pari and Kim.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Puja has a new connection to Kim.\n\n8. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja (which we don't need to consider for the path), and Pari.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Kim has a new connection to Ian.\n\n9. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari (which we don't need to consider for the path).\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Ian has a new connection to Puja.\n\n10. Puja is connected to Pari (which we don't need to consider for the path) and Pam.\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Puja has a new connection to Pam.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Eva to Pam is: Eva -> Amy -> Pari -> Puja -> Pam.\n\nAnswer: Eva, Amy, Pari, Puja, Pam"
