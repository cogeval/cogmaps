Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nNext, I will identify the connections of each scholar connected to Amir and see if any of them are directly connected to Pari. None of them are directly connected to Pari.\n\nI will then look at the second level of connections. Wim is connected to Jing. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is not connected to Pari. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is not connected to Pari. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of these are directly connected to Pari.\n\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of these are directly connected to Pari.\n\nTherefore, I will look at the third level of connections. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is not connected to Pari. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is not connected to Pari. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of these are directly connected to Pari.\n\nFrom the third level, I haven't found a connection to Pari. So I will continue to the fourth level. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Pari is directly connected to Sara.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Pari is through Sara. Sara is connected to Pari. So, the path is Amir -> Sara -> Pari.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Pari"
