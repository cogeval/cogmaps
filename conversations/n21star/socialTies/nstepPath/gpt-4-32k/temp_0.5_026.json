Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n2. Check the connections of these scholars. Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja do not have a direct connection to Prem.\n3. Next, we need to check the connections of the scholars they are connected to. \n4. Jing is connected to Raj, Wim, Wei, and Reza. None of them are connected to Prem.\n5. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. None of them are connected to Prem.\n6. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. None of them are connected to Prem.\n7. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. None of them are connected to Prem.\n8. Puja is only connected to Pari, who is not connected to Prem.\n9. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Prem.\n10. So, the shortest path from Pam to Prem is: Pam - Wei - Eva - Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Pam to Prem is Pam, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Pam, Wei, Eva, Prem"
