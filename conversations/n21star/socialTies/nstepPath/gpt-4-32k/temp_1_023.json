Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n\nNone of them is Matt, so we need to look one step further. We can see that:\n\n- Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Wim, and Raj, but not Matt.\n- Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari, but not Matt.\n- Ian is connected to Puja and Pari, but not Matt.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian, but not Matt.\n- Puja is connected to Pari, but not Matt.\n\nFrom the people Pam is connected with, only Pari has a direct connection to someone who is directly connected to Matt, that is Amy.\n\nThe shortest path from Pam to Matt is therefore: Pam -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Pari, Amy, Matt."
