Looking at Wim's connections, I see Jing. Jing's connections do not include Amy, so I move to Wim's next connection, which he doesn't have any others.\nI will now look at the connections of Jing from Reza's list. I see that Jing is connected to Raj, Wei, and Wim. I will now explore each of these connections to see if I can find a link to Amy.\n\nStarting with Raj, his connections are Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, none of these are Amy or connected to Amy.\n\nMoving onto Wei, his connections are Reza, Wim, and Eva. Checking each of these connections, I find that Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Reza to Amy is: Reza, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy"
