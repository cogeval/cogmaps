We'll start with Nisha, who is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. \n\nNext, we need to find a connection from one of these scholars to Amy. \n\nLooking at the connections, we can see that Pari is connected to Amy. \n\nChecking Nisha's connections again, we can see that none of them are directly connected to Pari. \n\nHowever, we see that Raj is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Ian and Ian is connected to Puja and Puja is connected to Pari and Pari is connected to Amy.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Nisha to Amy would be: Nisha, Raj, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Raj, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy."
