I start from Jing as requested, and figure out who is directly connected to Jing.\n\nThe text says that Jing is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Wim, and Pam.\n\nThen, I look at each of these scholars and their connections, in order to find the shortest path to Zack.\n\nAmir, Raj, Nisha, Wim, and Pam do not have a direct connection to Zack.\n\nLooking one step further, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n\nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n\nPam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n\nWim is connected to Jing.\n\nNone of these connections lead to Zack directly either, so I need to look one more step further.\n\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nReza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n\nKim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari.\n\nPuja is connected to Pari.\n\nPari is connected to Amy.\n\nAmy is connected to Matt.\n\nMatt is connected to Eva.\n\nEva is connected to Zack.\n\nFollowing this path, the shortest route from Jing to Zack is: Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Zack.\n\nSo, I can now provide the final answer.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Zack."
