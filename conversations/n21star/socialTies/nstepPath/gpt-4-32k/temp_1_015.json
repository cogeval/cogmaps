This can be done by creating a mental map or diagram of the connections.\n\nSecondly, we would need to start from Wei, who is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nThe third step is to look at the connections of Reza, Wim, and Eva. Neither Reza nor Wim are directly connected to Puja. Eva, however, is connected to Matt.\n\nNext, Matt is connected to Eva and Amy. But neither Eva nor Amy are directly connected to Puja.\n\nSo we will need to find a connection from Reza or Wim to someone who can eventually connect to Puja. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\nJing is connected to Raj, Pam, and Nisha. From those, Pam is connected to Puja. Therefore, the shortest path from Wei to Puja is: Wei, Reza, Jing, Pam, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Reza, Jing, Pam, Puja."
