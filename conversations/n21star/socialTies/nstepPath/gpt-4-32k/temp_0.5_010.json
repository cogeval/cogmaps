Jing is connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Pam, Reza, and Wim.\n\nSecond, I will check if Zack is directly connected to any of these scholars. Zack is not directly connected to any of them.\n\nThird, I will identify all the second-degree connections from Jing. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\nFourth, I will check if Zack is directly connected to any of these second-degree connections. Zack is still not directly connected to any of them.\n\nFifth, I will identify all the third-degree connections from Jing. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Puja is connected to Pari.\n\nSixth, I will check if Zack is directly connected to any of these third-degree connections. Zack is not directly connected to any of them.\n\nSeventh, I will identify all the fourth-degree connections from Jing. Eva is connected to Prem, Matt, and Amy. Pari is connected to Amy.\n\nEighth, I will check if Zack is directly connected to any of these fourth-degree connections. Zack is directly connected to Matt.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Zack is Jing - Pam - Moin - Puja - Pari - Amy - Matt - Zack.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Zack"
