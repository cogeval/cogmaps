I created a graph where each scholar is a node and each connection between scholars is an edge.\n2. I used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Reza to Gia.\n3. I assigned each scholar a number, starting with 1 for Reza and continuing in alphabetical order.\n4. I listed the scholar numbers in order, separated by commas.\n5.
