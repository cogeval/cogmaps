But now how to find this answer?\nLet us do this step by step. Below are the important things to remember to find answer in this task.\nHere number of scholars are 21.\nIn this task, amir has donated 50 books and Moin 10 books.\nAll the scholars are in a single connection tree. That means every scholar is interconnected.\nHow to find number of books if we select one scholar from a tree?\nThere are two ways. One is to find all the scholars with least number of books and count them.\nIf you can do it by one task, then please give me answer through one task and please make sure that answer must be as per regular expression.\nIt is not possible to find the answer for second part of this task by the first one. We need to find the path separately.\nPlease refer to https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/amirs-task/problem for more details and information about this task.\nPlease find the attached source code for finding answer of this task.\nhttps://hackernoon.com/finding-best-way-to-do-amirs-task-and-hackerrank-solutions-via-source-code-a-9efd17c0f681"
