Joe is working with Kai. Kai is working with Tom. Tom is working with Zac. You were told that if you  work with Joe, he can get you art supplies worth $100 for free. Now, Dan gives you his magic painting that can get you working with anyone you want only once. From Dan what is the path to the person you should work with to get the most reward?
