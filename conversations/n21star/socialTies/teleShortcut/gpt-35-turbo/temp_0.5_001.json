Start with Amir and add him to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first person from the queue.\n   - Check if the person has the maximum number of books. If yes, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add all the unvisited connected scholars of the current person to the queue and update their number of books.\n   - Mark the current person as visited.\n3. If the queue becomes empty and no person with the maximum number of books is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's perform the breadth-first search:\n\n1. Start with Amir and add him to the queue: Queue = [Amir]\n2. Dequeue Amir and check if he has the maximum number of books. Since Amir has 0 books, we continue.\n   - Add Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza to the queue and update their number of books: Queue = [Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza]\n   - Mark Amir as visited.\n3. Dequeue Wim and check if he has the maximum number of books. Since Wim has 0 books, we continue.\n   - Add Jing to the queue and update his number of books: Queue = [Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Jing]\n   - Mark Wim as visited.\n4. Dequeue Raj and check if he has the maximum number of books. Since Raj has 0 books, we continue.\n   - Add Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim to the queue and update their number of books: Queue = [Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim]\n   - Mark Raj as visited.\n5.
