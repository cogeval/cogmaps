Start from Amir and check the scholars he is connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n2. Among these scholars, we need to find the person with the maximum number of books. To do this, we'll iterate through each scholar and keep track of the person with the maximum number of books.\n\n3. Checking the connections, we find that Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are all connected to Amir. We need to consider the number of books donated by each scholar to determine the person with the maximum number of books.\n\n4. Since Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books, we compare the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\n   - Wim is not donating any books.\n   - Raj is not donating any books.\n   - Jing is not donating any books.\n   - Wei is not donating any books.\n   - Nisha is not donating any books.\n   - Reza is not donating any books.\n\n5. Among these scholars connected to Amir, none of them have any books to donate.\n\n6. Therefore, there is no direct path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: There is no direct path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books."

From Matt, we know that he is connected to Eva, Amy, Gia, and Ming. We need to consider the number of books donated by each of these scholars.\n\n6. Eva is connected to Wei and Prem. Wei is connected to Reza and Eva. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Considering the connections of Eva, Wei, and Prem, we find that:\n\n   - Eva is connected to Wei, who is connected to Reza. Reza is not donating any books.\n   - Eva is also connected to Prem, who is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva and Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is donating books but the specific number is not mentioned.\n\n7. Considering the connections explored so far, it seems that Matt may have the maximum number of books.\n\n8.
