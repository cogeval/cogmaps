We also need to keep track of the number of books each scholar has.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 nodes representing the scholars: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja, Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n\n2. Add the edges between the scholars based on the given connections.\n\n3. Initialize the number of books for each scholar:\n   - Amir: 0\n   - Wim: 0\n   - Raj: 0\n   - Jing: 0\n   - Wei: 0\n   - Nisha: 0\n   - Reza: 0\n   - Sara: 0\n   - Pari: 0\n   - Pam: 0\n   - Kim: 0\n   - Ian: 0\n   - Moin: 10\n   - Puja: 0\n   - Zack: 0\n   - Matt: 0\n   - Eva: 0\n   - Amy: 0\n   - Gia: 0\n   - Ming: 0\n   - Prem: 50\n\n4. Use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. Start the search from Amir and traverse the graph, keeping track of the number of books at each node.\n\n5. During the breadth-first search, update the number of books for each visited node by adding the number of books from the previous node.\n\n6. Stop the search when reaching the person with the maximum number of books. In this case, Prem has the maximum number of books (50).\n\n7. List the scholar names in order, starting from Amir and following the shortest path to Prem, separated by commas: Amir, Wim, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Prem."
