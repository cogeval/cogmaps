Set up a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Set up a dictionary to keep track of the number of books donated by each scholar. Initialize the values for Prem and Moin as 50 and 10, respectively.\n4. Set up a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar.\n5. Set up a variable to store the maximum number of books.\n6. Set up a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n7.

If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n   - Add the current scholar to the shortest path dictionary with the value of the shortest path from Amir.\n   - Explore the connections of the current scholar and enqueue any unvisited scholars.\n   - Update the number of books donated by each scholar based on the connections explored.\n8.
