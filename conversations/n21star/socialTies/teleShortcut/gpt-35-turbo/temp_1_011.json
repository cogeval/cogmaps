We need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem while considering the connections between scholars.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We will start from Amir and explore all his connections, then move to their connections and so on until we find Prem.\n\nUsing BFS, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is as follows:\n\nAmir, Wim, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva, Prem"
