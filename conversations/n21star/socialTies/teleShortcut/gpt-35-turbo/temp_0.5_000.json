You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir and set the number of books donated to 0.\n3. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n4. Check if the dequeued scholar has donated more books than the current maximum number of books. If yes, update the maximum number of books and store the name of the scholar.\n5. Enqueue all the connected scholars of the dequeued scholar (excluding the ones already visited) and update the number of books donated by them.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.\n7. Return the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\n1. Amir (0 books)\n2. Wim (0 books)\n3. Reza (0 books)\n4. Jing (0 books)\n5. Wei (0 books)\n6. Raj (0 books)\n7. Nisha (0 books)\n8. Pari (0 books)\n9. Pam (0 books)\n10. Kim (0 books)\n11.
