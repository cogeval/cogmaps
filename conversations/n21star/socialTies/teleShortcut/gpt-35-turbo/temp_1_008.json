We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar to determine the shortest path.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph representation of the connections:\n\nAmir - Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara - Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack - Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha - Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj - Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam - Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin - Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing - Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei - Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim - Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan - Puja, Pari\nGia - Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza - Wim, Jing\nPuja - Pari\nPrem - Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim - Jing\nPari - Amy\nAmy - Matt\nMatt - Eva\n\nNext, let's perform the BFS algorithm starting from Amir:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir.\n3. Add Amir to the visited set.\n4. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If so, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the scholar and update their path.\n   - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n5. If the loop ends without finding the scholar with the maximum number of books, return 'None' as there is no path.\n\nNow let's perform the BFS algorithm step by step:\n\n1.
