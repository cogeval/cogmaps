Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Create a graph representing the connections between scholars. Each scholar will be a node, and the connections between them will be represented as edges.\n\n2. Initialize a queue to perform the BFS. Enqueue Amir as the starting node.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a scholar from the queue and check if they have any connections.\n\n4. If the scholar has connections, enqueue all their connected scholars (except the ones already visited).\n\n5. Keep track of the number of books each visited scholar has donated.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.\n\n7. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books and note their name.\n\n8. Backtrack from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir to determine the shortest path. This can be done by following the path of predecessors recorded during the BFS.\n\n9.
