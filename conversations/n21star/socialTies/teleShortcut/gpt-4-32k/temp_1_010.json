Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

So, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, I'll figure out the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nChecking connections from Amir's direct connections:\n\n- Raj and Wim have no connection to Prem.\n- Jing has no connection to Prem.\n- Wei is connected to Reza and Eva, but they do not lead to Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, and Raj, which also do not lead to Prem.\n- Reza is connected to Jing and Wim, also does not lead to Prem.\n\nNone of the connections from Amir are directly linked to Prem. Now let's move to Zack as Zack is connected to Prem.\n\nChecking the mutual connections between Amir and Zack, we find Nisha and Reza. Both Nisha and Reza don't have a direct connection to Zack, but Nisha is connected to Reza and Reza is connected to Wim, who is connected to Zack.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, which is Prem, is: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Zack, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Zack, Prem"
