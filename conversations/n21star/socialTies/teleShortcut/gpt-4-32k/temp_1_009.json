Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem who is donating 50 books.\n\nNext, we identify Amir's direct connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nWe then analyze these connections to see if any of them are directly linked to Prem. \n\nFrom Amir's connections:\n1. Wim is connected to Jing.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n3. Jing has no further connections provided.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nNone of these are directly connected to Prem. \n\nNext, we look at the second degree of connections, for the ones we know are connected to Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nFrom these connections:\n1. Wim is connected to Jing.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n3. Jing is not further connected.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nFrom these connections, only Eva is connected to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, going via one of Amir's connections and taking the route that leads to Eva, would be via Wei. So the path is Amir-Wei-Eva-Prem.\n\nThis means the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

Also, we are given a new information that Amir is now married to Vivian, who has an instant connection portal with all of Matt's connections.\n\nThe first step is to look at who Matt is connected to. Matt is connected to Eva, Amy, and Prem.\n\nPrem is in Matt's connection list, and therefore, Prem is also in Vivian's connection list due to the instant connection portal.\n\nNow, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem), going via Vivian and then connecting directly to Prem through the instant connection portal, is: Amir, Vivian, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem."
