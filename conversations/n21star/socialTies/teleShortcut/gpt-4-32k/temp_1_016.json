Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Prem is not in this list, so let's check the connections of each scholar connected to Amir.\n4. Wim is connected to Jing.\n5. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n6. Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza do not have connections to Prem.\n7. Ming is connected to Prem, but there is no direct or indirect link from Amir to Ming.\n8. Therefore, we must find a link from the scholars connected to Amir to Prem.\n9. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n10. The only connection between the scholars connected to Amir and the scholars connected to Gia is through Amy (since Amy is connected to Matt).\n11. From the information given, Pari is connected to Amy.\n12. But Pari is not directly linked with Amir, she is directly linked with Sara.\n13. Sara is linked with Kim, and Kim is linked with Amir.\n14. Therefore, the path goes from Amir to Kim, from Kim to Sara, from Sara to Pari, from Pari to Amy, from Amy to Matt, and from Matt to Prem.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, which is Prem, is Amir, Kim, Sara, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Kim, Sara, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem"
