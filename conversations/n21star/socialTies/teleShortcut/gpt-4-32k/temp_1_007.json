Therefore, the largest donation comes from Prem.\n\nNext, we determine the network connections starting from Amir, to find the shortest path to reach Prem.\n\nHere is the path:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing.\n4. Jing is connected to Raj.\n5. Raj is connected to Wei.\n6. Wei is connected to Eva.\n7. Eva is connected to Matt.\n8. Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nFollowing this path, we find that the shortest path from Amir to Prem, the person with the largest number of books, is Amir, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
