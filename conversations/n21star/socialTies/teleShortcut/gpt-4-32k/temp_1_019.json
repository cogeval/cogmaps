Since Prem has the maximum number of books, we should find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nLet's trace the connections as mentioned:\n\n1. Starting with Amir, who is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. None of these individuals have a direct connection to Prem.\n3. However, Wei is connected to Eva.\n4. Eva is connected to Matt.\n5. And, Matt is connected to Prem, who has the maximum number of books.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
