Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Then, I need to trace the shortest connection path from Amir to Prem.\n\nFrom the description, Amir is connected to the following scholars: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nFirst, I'm going to check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Prem. It seems none of them are directly connected to Prem.\n\nTherefore, I have to find a second connection. The scholars connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are: \n\n- Wim is connected to Jing, \n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim,\n- Jing doesn't have any other connections,\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva,\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei,\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nNone of these scholars are directly connected to Prem as well. \n\nTherefore, I have to go to the third connection level. Scholars connected to Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are:\n\n- Wim has no further connections,\n- Raj doesn't have any new connections,\n- Wei has one new connection - Eva,\n- Nisha doesn't have any new connections,\n- Reza doesn't have any new connections.\n\nEva has the following connections: Prem, Matt, Gia, and Amy. \n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the most books (Prem) goes through Wei, then Eva and finally Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
