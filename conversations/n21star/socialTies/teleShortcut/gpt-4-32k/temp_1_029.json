Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the given information, it is clear that Prem is donating the most books (50).\n\nSecond, I will trace a path from Amir to Prem. From the information, it seems like Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nAmong these, Reza is directly connected to Wim and Jing. Jing is connected to Wim as well. Wim does not have a direct connection to Prem. \n\nHowever, Wei who is also directly connected to Amir, is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva in turn is directly connected to Matt, Gia, and Prem.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum books (Prem) is: Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem.\n\nAssistant: Answer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

This means that from Vivian, you can connect with any scholar who is connected to Matt. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

It is known that Matt is directly connected to Eva, Prem, and Amy.\n\nSince Prem has the maximum number of books and is directly connected to Matt, this means that through Vivian, Amir can directly reach Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem with the new connection portal would be Amir - Vivian - Prem.\n\nAssistant: Answer: Amir, Vivian, Prem."
