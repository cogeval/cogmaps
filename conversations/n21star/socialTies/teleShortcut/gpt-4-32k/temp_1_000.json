Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem has the maximum number of books. \n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \nNone of them are directly connected to Prem. \n\nBut among these scholars, Wim is directly connected to Jing who is directly connected to Pam. Pam is connected to Kim, and Kim is connected to Ian. Finally, Ian is directly connected to Puja who is directly connected to Pari, and Pari is directly connected to Amy, and Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is directly connected to Prem.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Prem is:\nAmir, Wim, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem."
