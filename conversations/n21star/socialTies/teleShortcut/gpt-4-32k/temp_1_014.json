Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

That is Prem with 50 books.\nStep 2: Understand that Amir can only take books from one person, so he needs the shortest path to Prem.\nStep 3: Map out the connections from Amir. His connections include: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\nStep 4: Determine if any of Amir's connections are directly connected to Prem. None of them are.\nStep 5: Evaluate the connections of Amir's connections to identify the shortest path to Prem. From my analysis, the shortest path is: Amir - Zack - Prem.\nStep 6: List the names in the order they are connected to form the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Zack, Prem"

They are Eva, Amy, and Prem.\nStep 4: Vivian can therefore connect to Eva, Amy, and importantly, Prem.\nStep 5: As Amir is connected to Vivian, and Vivian can directly connect with Prem, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is now through Vivian.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem"
