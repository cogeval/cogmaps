Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

In this case, the maximum number of books is being donated by Prem. \n\nStarting with Amir, we know that Amir is connected to Raj, Wim, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nFrom this group of scholars, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim; Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Matt, Gia and Amy.\n\nFinally, Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva and Prem. Thus, we have a path from Amir to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem will be: \nAmir - Wei - Eva - Amy - Matt - Prem. \n\nHence the final answer.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Amy, Matt, Prem"
