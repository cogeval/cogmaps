Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

In this case, it's Prem who is donating 50 books.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. The connections are as follows:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. None of these people are directly connected to Prem, so we need to find a connection through another person.\n3. Zack is directly connected to Prem, so we need to find a connection from Amir to Zack.\n4. Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n5. Jing is directly connected to Pam.\n6. Pam is directly connected to Sara.\n7. Sara is directly connected to Zack.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Pam, Sara, Zack, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Pam, Sara, Zack, Prem."
