Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Out of these scholars, the ones that connect to other scholars who eventually lead to Prem (who has the most books) are Wim, Jing, and Wei. \n\nFrom Wim, the only connected scholar is Jing. From Jing, the only path to reach Prem is through Pam and then Kim, which is a lengthy path.\n\nFrom Wei, the only connection that leads to Prem is Eva, but Wei is only connected to her through Reza and Wim, which would also include Jing and Pam, making it another lengthy path. \n\nThe last connection is Jing, who is connected to Pam and Kim. From Kim, we have a direct link to Prem. So, this would be the shortest path starting from Amir to reach Prem. \n\nSo, the order of scholars from Amir to Prem, going through the shortest path is Amir, Jing, Pam, Kim, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Kim, Prem"

Matt is connected to Zack, Ming, Gia, Eva, Amy, and Prem. From Amir, we can directly reach to Vivian.\n\nSince Vivian can connect with any of Matt's connections, we can directly reach Prem from Vivian. \n\nThis introduces a new shortest path from Amir to Prem, which is through Vivian.\n\nSo, the order of scholars from Amir to Prem, going through this new shortest path is Amir, Vivian, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem"
