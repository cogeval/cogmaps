From Dan's connections, Bob is working with Gus and Dan.\n3. Cal is working with Dan, Eva, Gus, and Bob.\n4. Eva is working with Gus, Bob, and Zac.\n5. Gus is working with Bob and Dan.\n\nNow let's check each of Dan's connections to see if they have a connection to Joe:\n\n- Bob is not connected to Joe.\n- Cal is not connected to Joe.\n- Eva is connected to Zac, who is connected to Tom, who is connected to Joe.\n- Gus is not connected to Joe.\n\nSo the shortest path from Dan to Joe is through Eva, Zac, and Tom.\n\nAnswer: Dan, Eva, Zac, Tom, Joe"
