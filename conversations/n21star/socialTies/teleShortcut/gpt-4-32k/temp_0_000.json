Dan is working with Amy, Cal, Gus, and Bob.\n3. Check each of these connections to see if they are working with Joe or someone who is working with Joe.\n4. Amy is not connected to Joe.\n5. Cal is not connected to Joe.\n6. Gus is working with Bob and Dan, but not Joe.\n7. Bob is working with Dan and Eva.\n8. Eva is not connected to Joe.\n9. Since none of Dan's direct connections lead to Joe, we need to check the next level of connections.\n10. Cal is working with Dan, Eva, Gus, and Bob.\n11. Eva is working with Gus, Bob, and Zac.\n12. Gus is working with Bob and Dan.\n13. Bob is working with Dan and Eva.\n14. None of these connections lead to Joe, so we need to check the next level of connections.\n15. Eva is working with Gus, Bob, and Zac.\n16. Zac is working with Sue, Pam, Gia, Tom, and Liv.\n17. Sue is not connected to Joe.\n18. Pam is not connected to Joe.\n19. Gia is working with Tom, Zac, and Kai.\n20. Tom is working with Zac, Liv, Gia, and Kai.\n21. Liv is not connected to Joe.\n22. Kai is working with Tom, Gia, and Joe.\n23. Finally, we found a connection to Joe through Kai.\n\nSo, the path from Dan to Joe is: Dan, Bob, Eva, Zac, Kai, Joe.\n\nAnswer: Dan, Bob, Eva, Zac, Kai, Joe"
