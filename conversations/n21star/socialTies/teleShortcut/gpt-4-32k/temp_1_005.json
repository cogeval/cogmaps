Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Looking at those connections, we see that none of these scholars are directly connected to either Moin or Prem, who are the scholars with the book donations. \n\nTo reach Prem, who has the maximum number of books (50), we need to find the shortest path. \n\nA possible path could be:\n\n1. Amir -> Wei\n2. Wei -> Eva\n3. Eva -> Matt\n4. Matt -> Prem\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books are Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, and Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."

Since we want to reach Prem who has the maximum number of books (50), we can directly connect to Prem through Vivian. \n\nNow, the new shortest path from Amir to Prem is:\n1. Amir -> Vivian\n2. Vivian -> Prem\n\nSo, the scholar names in order from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, using Vivian\u2019s instant connection portal, are Amir, Vivian and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem."
