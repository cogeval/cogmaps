Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Create a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path from Amir to each scholar, with Amir as the starting point.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar has more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum books and the scholar with the maximum books.\n   c. Check the connections of the dequeued scholar:\n      - If a connected scholar has not been visited before, enqueue the scholar, mark it as visited, and update the shortest path from Amir to this scholar in the dictionary.\n   d.
