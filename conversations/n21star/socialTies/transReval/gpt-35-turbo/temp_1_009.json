Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the connections between scholars.\n5. Create a variable to store the maximum number of books and initialize it to 0.\n6. Create a variable to store the scholar with the maximum number of books and initialize it to None.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n7. Dequeue a scholar from the queue and mark them as visited.\n8. Check if the current scholar has more books than the maximum number of books so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n9.
