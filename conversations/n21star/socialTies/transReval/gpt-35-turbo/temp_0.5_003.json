Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Take the next scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if this scholar has donated books. If yes, this is the person with the maximum number of books. Stop the search.\n   - If the scholar has not donated books, add all their connected scholars (who have not been visited before) to the queue.\n4. If the search ends without finding a person who has donated books, then there is no path from Amir to any scholar with books.\n\nApplying this algorithm:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them have donated books, so add them to the queue.\n3. Next, take Wim from the queue.
