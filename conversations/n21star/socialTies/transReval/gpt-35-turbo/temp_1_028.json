Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. We need to check which of these scholars has the maximum number of books.\n\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n5. Wei is connected to Reza and Wim.\n6. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n7. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that Wim, Raj, and Reza are all connected to each other. However, we do not know how many books each of them has.\n\n8. Moin is donating 10 books.\n9. Prem is donating 50 books.\n\nSince Prem is donating the maximum number of books (50), we need to find a path from Amir to Prem.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is:\n\nAmir, Wim, Reza, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Reza, Prem"

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n2. Wim is connected to Raj and Reza.\n3. Raj is connected to Reza.\n\nWe can see that both Wim and Raj are connected to Reza. However, we do not have information about the number of books each scholar has. \n\nNext, let's consider the updated connections:\n\n4. Jing is connected to Eva.\n\nNow, let's consider the new connections for Wei:\n\n5. Wei is connected to Pam.\n\nBased on the given information, we do not have any direct connection from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. We also do not know the number of books each scholar has, so we cannot determine the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide a list of scholar names in order from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Not possible to determine the shortest path."
