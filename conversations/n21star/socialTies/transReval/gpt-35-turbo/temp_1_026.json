From the given connections, we can see that Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Among these connections, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n3. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Wim is only connected to Jing.\n5. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the book donations:\n\n1. Prem is donating 50 books.\n2. Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nSince Prem is donating the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nUsing the given connections and analyzing the connections of the connected scholars, we can determine the shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering that we can only take books from one person. \n\nAmir -> Nisha -> Reza -> Wim -> Jing -> Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Jing, Prem"
