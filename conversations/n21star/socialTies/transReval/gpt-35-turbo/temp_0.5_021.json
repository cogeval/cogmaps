We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar one by one until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be explored.\n2. Add Amir to the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books donated by each scholar.\n5. Set the number of books donated by Prem to 50 and Moin to 10.\n6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and add their connections to the queue.\n   - Update the number of books donated by the scholar by summing the number of books donated by their connections.\n7. Find the scholar with the maximum number of books donated.\n8. Trace back the path from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the connections.\n9. Return the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Wei, Eva, Amy, Matt, Gia, Prem"
