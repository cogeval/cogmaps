Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Wei is connected to Reza.\n5. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n6. Wim has no further connections.\n7. Jing has no further connections.\n8. Reza has no further connections.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of books each scholar has:\n\n- Amir: 0 books\n- Wim: 0 books\n- Jing: 0 books\n- Wei: 0 books\n- Nisha: 0 books\n- Reza: 0 books\n\nSince all the scholars connected to Amir have 0 books, we need to explore other paths.
