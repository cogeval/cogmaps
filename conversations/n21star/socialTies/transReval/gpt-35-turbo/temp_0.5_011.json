We will start with Amir and explore his connections, then move on to their connections, and so on, until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Move to the next level: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Check their connections:\n   - Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Eva.\n   - Raj's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - Jing's connections: Wei, Reza, Wim, Raj, and Pam.\n   - Wei's connections: Reza, Wim, Jing, Raj, and Eva.\n   - Nisha's connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Reza's connections: Wim, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Continue exploring the connections until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Prem is donating 50 books, which is the maximum. To find the shortest path from Amir to Prem, we need to find the connections that lead to Prem.\n\nFollowing the steps above, we find that the shortest path from Amir to Prem is as follows:\n\nAmir, Wim, Wei, Eva, Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva, Prem"
