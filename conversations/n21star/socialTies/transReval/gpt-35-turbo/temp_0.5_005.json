However, we don't have information about their book donations yet.\n\nWe also know that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. We need to find the person who has the maximum number of books among all the scholars.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, we need to determine the book donation of each scholar connected to Amir and then identify the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's analyze the connections and book donations step by step:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Jing is connected to Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n5. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n6. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n7. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n8. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n9. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n10. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n11. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n12. Puja is connected to Pari.\n13. Pari is connected to Amy.\n14. Amy is connected to Matt.\n15. Matt is connected to Eva.\n16. Eva is connected to Ming, Prem, Amy, and Wei.\n17. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n18. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n19. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\n- Prem is donating 50 books.\n- Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nSince Prem has donated the maximum number of books, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nBased on the connections, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering only the scholars connected to Amir, is as follows:\n\nAmir, Wim, Jing, Moin, Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Moin, Prem"
