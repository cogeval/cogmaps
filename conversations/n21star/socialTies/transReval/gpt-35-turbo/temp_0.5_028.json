Continue this process until we find the person with the maximum number of books.\n5. Keep track of the number of books each scholar has donated.\n6. Once we find the person with the maximum number of books, we can stop the search.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva"
