Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Wim is connected to Jing.\n5. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n6. Jing has no additional connections.\n\nNow, we know the connections between scholars. Let's find the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\n- Prem is donating 50 books.\n- Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nTo find the shortest path from Amir to Prem, we need to identify the connections between the scholars and trace the path:\n\nAmir -> Wim -> Jing -> Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Prem"
