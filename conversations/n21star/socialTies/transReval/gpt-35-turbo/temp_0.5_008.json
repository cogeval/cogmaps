Start from Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Move to the next level of connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Check their connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, and Prem.\n5. Move to the next level of connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, and Prem.\n6. Check their connections: Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, and Amy.\n7. Move to the next level of connections: Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, and Amy.\n8. Check their connections: Jing, Wei, Eva, and Amy.\n9. Move to the next level of connections: Jing, Wei, Eva, and Amy.\n10. Check their connections: Eva and Matt.\n11. Move to the next level of connections: Eva and Matt.\n12. Check their connections: None.\n13. Move to the next level of connections: None.\n14.
