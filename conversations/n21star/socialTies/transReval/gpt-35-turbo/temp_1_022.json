Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Starting from Amir, we will explore each scholar's connections and keep track of the number of books they have donated. We will continue until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue and an empty visited set.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n     - Check if the scholar has donated books.\n     - If yes, store their name and the number of books donated as the current maximum.\n     - Iterate through the connections of the current scholar:\n         - If a connected scholar has not been visited, enqueue them and mark them as visited.\n4. Return the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Eva"
