We can use the regular expression object in our program.\n\nThe first part is the regular expression. The second part is the string. In the third part, we can specify the flags and specify what we want to return from the regular expression.\n\nIn the below example, we can see that it returns a string. We can use it for a match or a findall() method.\n\nIf you want to search for a match, you can use the search() method. This method will return a match object. If you use the group() method, it will return a tuple.\n\nWe can see the matches in the example below. If we want to get all the matches, we can use the search() method.\n\nIf we want to get all the matches and replace them with something else, we can use the search and replace() method.\n\nIn"
