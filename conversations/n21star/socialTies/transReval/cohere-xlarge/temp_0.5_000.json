Max is connected to Ola and Joe. Liv is working with Gia, Tom, Zac, and Kai. Gus is working with Bob, and Dan. Ola is working with Joe. Gia is working Tom, Zac, and Kai. Bob is working with Dan. Joe is working with Kai. Kai is working with Tom. Tom is working with Zac. You have been told that if you  work with Joe, he can get you art supplies worth $100 for free. Assume now that Dan and Kai are working together. From Dan what is the path to the person you should work with to get the most reward? Please list the names in order, separated by commas."

We will store the names of the people in a list and the path to the person to get the most reward in a dictionary.\n\nWe will now loop through the list of people and for each person in the list we will get the path to the person to get the most reward. We will use the following code to get the path to the person to get the most reward.\n\nNow that we have the path to the person to get the most reward, we will print the path to the person to get the most reward using the following code.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to print the path to the person to get the most reward. The path to the person to get the most reward is Dan, Kai.\n\nIn this article, we learned how to print the path to the person to get the most reward.
