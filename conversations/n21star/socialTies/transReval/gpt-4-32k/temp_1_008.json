Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nSecond, I need to identify the shortest path from Amir to Prem. I should follow the connections between scholars and find the shortest route.\n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these individuals are directly connected to Prem. \n\nMoving to the next degree of connections, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim; Reza is connected to Wim and Jing; Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva; and Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Notably, Wei is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Prem. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem (the person with the maximum number of books) is Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
