Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Prem donated 50 books and Moin donated 10 books, it is clear that Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nThen, to determine the shortest path from Amir to Prem, I need to analyze the connections of scholars provided. \n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them are connected directly to Prem. Among them, Wei is connected to Eva who is in turn connected to Prem. Hence, the shortest path from Amir to Prem through these connections is Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
