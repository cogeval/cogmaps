Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

So, Prem is the one with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's start mapping the shortest path from Amir to Prem:\n\n1. Start from Amir\n2. Amir is directly connected with Wim, so next go to Wim.\n3. From Wim, we can't directly go to Prem, but Wim is connected with Jing.\n4. Jing also doesn't have a direct connection with Prem, but is connected to Wei.\n5. From Wei, we can go to Eva.\n6. Eva is connected with Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem."
