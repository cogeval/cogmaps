Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

The person with the maximum number of books is Prem.\n   \n2. Find out who Amir is directly connected to.\n   According to the information given, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n   \n3. Determine if any of these scholars are directly connected to Prem.\n   It seems none of them are directly connected to Prem. \n   \n4. Move to the next level, checking if the scholars Amir is connected to are linked to others who are directly connected to Prem.\n   Wim is connected to Jing; Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim; Jing is not directly connected to Prem; Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei; Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva; Reza is connected to Wim and Jing; None of these are directly connected to Prem.\n   \n5. Repeat step 4, now considering connections of connections: \n   Eva, who Wei is connected to, is directly connected to Prem.\n   \n6. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, Prem, is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Amir's direct connections are unchanged: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n3. Since the connections between Jing, Pam, Eva, and Wei have changed, we should reevaluate if any of these scholars are directly connected to Prem. Jing is now directly connected to Eva who in turn is directly connected to Prem. \n\n4. So, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, after the changes, is: Amir, Jing, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Eva, Prem"
