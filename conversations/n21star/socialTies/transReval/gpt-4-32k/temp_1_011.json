Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Identify the scholar with the maximum number of books: Comparing the number of books that Prem and Moin are donating, it is clear that Prem is the one with the maximum number of books.\n\n2. Identify the connections: Start from Amir, his connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n3. Find the shortest path to Prem: Looking at all connections, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nSo, the order of scholar names from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nNote: The shortest path means the least number of connections from Amir to Prem. There may be other paths, but they involve more connections. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Find the shortest path to Prem: With the new connections, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is now Amir -> Jing -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nNote: The shortest path means the least number of connections from Amir to Prem.
