Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n3. Jing does not have a direct connection to Prem.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nNone of Amir's direct connections have a connection to Prem. Therefore, we need to move to the second degree of separation. From the connections of Amir's connections:\n\n1. Wim's only connection, Jing, does not have a direct connection to Prem.\n2.
