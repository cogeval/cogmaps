Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We observe that Nisha from Amir's connections is also connected with Wim. And Wim is connected with Jing. Also, Amy (from Prem's connections) is connected with Matt, who is connected to Eva. Eva, in turn, is connected to Wei, who is directly connected with Amir. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem (the person with maximum books) could be Amir to Wei to Eva to Matt to Prem. \n\nTherefore, the list of scholars in order would be Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem. \n\nThe answer, following the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+', would be\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"

The earlier connection of Wei and Eva doesn't exist now. \n\nThe common connection now occurs between Jing (from Amir's group) who is directly connected to Eva. Then Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected with Prem who has the most books. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, the person with maximum books could be Amir to Jing to Eva to Matt to Prem.\n\nThe answer, following the regular expression 'Answer: ([A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+', would be \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Eva, Matt, Prem"
