Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

In this case, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem with 50 books. Let's look at who Amir is connected with. Amir is connected with Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. From the scholars Amir is connected with, Wim is connected with Jing, Reza is connected with Wim and Jing, Wei is connected with Reza, Wim, and Eva, Raj is connected with Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, Jing is connected with no one further and Nisha is connected with Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. From these further connections, only Wei is connected with Eva who is then connected to Matt who is then finally connected to Prem.
