Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

According to the prompt, Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books, so Prem is the one with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, I would have to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. I would do this by examining the connections of each scholar as given in the task.\n\nLooking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nTo find the shortest path to Prem from Amir, I would have to find if any of these scholars are directly connected to Prem.\n\nLooking at the list of connections, Zack is directly connected to Prem. But, Amir is not directly connected to Zack. \n\nTherefore, I would have to find a scholar who is directly connected to both Amir and Zack. \n\nExamining the prompt again, I realize that Wei is directly connected to both Amir and Eva. Zack is connected to Eva too. Through Eva, we can reach Zack and then Prem.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is through Wei, Eva, Zack, and then Prem.\n\nSo the list of scholars in order from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Zack, Prem."

From Wei, we can go to Pam. Pam, however, is not directly connected to Eva, Zack, or Prem.\n\nLooking at the other connections, Jing who is directly connected to Amir is now connected to Eva as well. From Eva, we can reach Zack and Zack is directly connected to Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is now through Jing, Eva, Zack, and then Prem.\n\nSo the list of scholars in order from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Jing, Eva, Zack, Prem."
