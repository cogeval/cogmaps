Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We can identify that Prem is the one who is donating the maximum number of books, which is 50 books.\n\nStep 2: Draw a diagram or chart mapping out the connections between the scholars, beginning with Amir and tracking through the connected individuals until reaching Prem.\n\nStep 3: The connections for Amir include Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 4: Check these connected individuals for any connections to Prem. Unfortunately, none of these scholars have direct connections to Prem.\n\nStep 5: Check the next level of connections. This is where the connections from the scholars connected to Amir lead to the next scholars.\n\nStep 6: Wei is connected to Eva. Eva is connected to Prem. This appears to be the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
