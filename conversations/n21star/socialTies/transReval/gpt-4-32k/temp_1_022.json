Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Based on the information provided, Prem has the maximum number of books, i.e., 50 books.\n\nNext, I will trace the shortest path from Amir to Prem by examining Amir's connections and subsequently their connections and so on. I will continue this process until I find Prem.\n\nThe path starts from Amir. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Among these, Nisha and Reza are directly connected to Prem. So the shortest path from Amir to the person with the most books (Prem) is through Nisha or Reza.\n\nAmir has an equal distance to Prem whether he goes through Nisha or Reza, therefore both paths can be considered the shortest. The shortest paths would look like this:\n\nAmir -> Nisha -> Prem\nor\nAmir -> Reza -> Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Prem or Amir, Reza, Prem."

Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Considering the changes, Amir is indirectly connected to Prem through Reza. So the shortest path is:\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Prem"
