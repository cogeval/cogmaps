Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

To do this, we need to see who Amir is connected to, and then continue down the line until we reach Prem.\n\nFirst, we check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these connections lead directly to Prem. \n\nNext, we look at the connections of these six scholars:\n\n1. Wim is only connected to Jing, which doesn't lead to Prem.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. But these also don't lead to Prem.\n3. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, and Wim. These also don't lead to Prem.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is a new connection, but she also doesn't lead to Prem.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. These do not lead to Prem.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. These also don't lead to Prem.\n\nThis means we need to look at the third step connections:\n\n1. Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, and Gia. Matt is a new connection, but Matt doesn't directly connect to Prem. \n2. Matt is connected to Eva and Amy, but not to Prem.\n3. Amy is connected to Matt and this does not lead to Prem.\n\nThis seems like a dead end, so let's backtrack and check the connections from Reza:\n\n1. Reza is connected to Jing and Wim. Checking their second degree connections doesn't lead to Prem.\n\nWe then need to look into the connections of Nisha:\n\n1. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Wei is connected to Eva and this could lead to a possible path.\n2. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n3. Eva is connected to Amy and Matt.\n4. Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nFinally, we have found the path from Amir to the person with maximum number of books. The path is Amir -> Nisha -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nThe scholar names in order are Amir, Nisha, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."

None of these are directly connected to Prem.\n\nNext, we look at the connections of these six scholars:\n\n1. Wim is only connected to Jing, which doesn't lead to Prem.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. But these also don't lead to Prem.\n3. Jing is now connected to Eva due to the updated connections. This could potentially lead to Prem.\n4. Wei is now connected to Pam instead of Eva. This also doesn't lead to Prem.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. These also don't lead to Prem.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, which don't lead to Prem.\n\nFrom Jing's connections, we can see she is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt and Amy. Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nThus, we have found the path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. The path is Amir -> Jing -> Eva -> Matt -> Prem. \n\nThe scholar names in order are Amir, Jing, Eva, Matt, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Eva, Matt, Prem."
