Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

As per the description, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem with 50 books. I'll start from Amir and find the quickest way to Prem.\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. From Amir, I see he is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. None of these people is directly connected to Prem, so I need to find who among them has a connection to someone who is connected to Prem.\n4. Looking at their connections, I find that Wei is connected to Eva, who in turn is connected to Prem.\n5. This means that the shortest path from Amir to Prem goes from Amir to Wei, from Wei to Eva, and from Eva to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nLet's provide the final outcome."

None of these people is directly connected to Prem, so I need to find who among them has a connection to someone who is connected to Prem.\n4.
