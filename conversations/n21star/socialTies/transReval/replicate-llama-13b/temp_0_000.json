Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

For instance, you may start at Amir: \"Amir, Reza, Jing, Raj, Moin\".\n(3+0+8+0+0+0+2+0+0+0) = 20 points\nYou will be given a query and must form a regular expression from it. The matcher will then find a person that does not match your regular expression, and the length of your regular expression will then be counted.\nThe regular expressions will be given in the format of a question followed by a colon. The question is followed by a description of the data of the person to be tested. You can also provide a regular expression that should not be matched, which is denoted with a caret '^' instead of a colon. The matcher will fail on all other test cases. The format of a non-matching regular expression is [^regex].\nAfter the regular expression is found, it is passed to the matcher, which will then proceed through the given data-points in order, and report if it finds a match. If you provide a match, then the matcher will return the length of the regular expression that matches it. Afterwards, the system will give the result of the matcher. We have given some sample test cases. You can try different regular expressions, and check if the results are what the sample test cases show. Here's a sample regular expression: '[^A-Za-z0-9:]*'\nThe first line will contain the number of test cases n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50)\nEach test case begins with an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\nThen follows n integers, in the same order they will appear in the input.\nFor each of the n integers, the next line has the number of people that the integer appears in, followed by n spaces and then the integer. People do not share space.\nThe next line contains the integer n again to denote that the test case of 15 is the n-th test case. Then a colon to denote we are done with the last test case.\nA blank line in between test cases denotes a new set of test cases.\nThere will be space at the beginning of the input lines unless otherwise stated. There will be no space between the output in the form of lines."
