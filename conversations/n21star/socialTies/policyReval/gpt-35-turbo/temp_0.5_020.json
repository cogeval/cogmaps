Iterate through the given connections and update the dictionary accordingly.\n3. Start from Amir and perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n4. Keep track of the visited scholars to avoid loops.\n5. Once the BFS is complete, return the path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Eva"
