Start with Amir.\n2. Check the connections of Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each of the connected scholars: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. (excluding previously visited scholars)\n4. Continue this process until we find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n5. Keep track of the path taken to reach the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can determine the following connections for each scholar:\n\n- Amir is connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Wim is connected to: Jing.\n- Raj is connected to: Jing, Wei, and Reza.\n- Jing is connected to: Wei and Reza.\n- Wei is connected to: Reza and Eva.\n- Nisha is connected to: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Reza is connected to: Wim and Jing.\n- Eva is connected to: Matt.\n- Matt is connected to: Amy.\n- Amy is connected to: Prem.\n- Prem is connected to: Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Moin is connected to: Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n- Puja is connected to: Pari.\n- Pari is connected to: Amy.\n- Kim is connected to: Ian and Puja.\n- Ian is connected to: Puja.\n\nNow, let's follow the connections starting from Amir until we reach the scholar with the maximum number of books:\n\nAmir -> Reza -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Amy -> Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Prem"
