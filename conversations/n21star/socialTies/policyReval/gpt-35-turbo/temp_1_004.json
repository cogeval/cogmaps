Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n   - Add the connections to the queue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n   - Update the current path for each connection: Amir - Wim, Amir - Raj, Amir - Jing, Amir - Wei, Amir - Nisha, Amir - Reza\n\n3. Take the first connection from the queue: Wim\n   - Path length: 1\n   - Current path: Amir, Wim\n   - Check Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, and Eva (Note: We have already visited Reza through Nisha, so we skip it.)\n   - Add the connections to the queue: Jing, Wei, Eva\n   - Update the current path for each connection: Amir - Wim - Jing, Amir - Wim - Wei, Amir - Wim - Eva\n\n4.
