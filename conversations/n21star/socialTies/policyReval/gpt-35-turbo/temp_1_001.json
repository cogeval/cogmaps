Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

            "content": "To find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, we need to consider the connections between the scholars and their book donations. We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. Here are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Create a graph representing the connections between the scholars.\n2. Assign a weight of 1 to each edge in the graph since we are only concerned with finding the shortest path.\n3. Initialize the distances from Amir to all other scholars as infinity, except for Amir himself, which is 0.\n4. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n5. Initialize a priority queue to store the scholars and their corresponding distances.\n6. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the scholar with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - Mark the scholar as visited.\n   - Update the distances to its neighboring scholars if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.\n   - Add the unvisited neighboring scholars to the priority queue.\n7. Once all scholars have been visited, find the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n8. Trace back from the scholar with the maximum number of books to Amir using the recorded distances and connections.\n9. List the scholars in the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, including Amir.\n\nNow let's execute these steps to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books."
