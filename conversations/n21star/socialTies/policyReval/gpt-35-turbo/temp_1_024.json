Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. We start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Among these connections, we check the number of books donated by each scholar.\n4. Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Nisha have not donated any books.\n5. Reza has not donated any books either.\n6. Moving on to the scholars connected to Reza, we see that Wim, Jing, Wei, and Raj have not donated any books.\n7. Among these scholars, Wim is the closest to Reza and has not donated any books.\n8. Continuing from Wim, we check if he is connected to any scholars who have donated books.\n9. Wim is connected to Jing, who has not donated any books.\n10. Now, we move on to the scholars connected to Jing.\n11. Jing is connected to Raj, Wei, and Wim (already considered).\n12. Among these scholars, Raj is the closest to Jing and has not donated any books.\n13. From Raj, we check if he is connected to any scholars who have donated books.\n14. Raj is connected to Wei, who has not donated any books.\n15. Finally, from Wei, we check if he is connected to any scholars who have donated books.\n16. Wei is connected to Eva, who has donated books.\n17. Eva is connected to Matt, who has donated books.\n18. Matt is connected to Amy, who has donated books.\n19. Amy is connected to Pari, who has donated books.\n20. Pari is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari"

Since Sara has a higher number of books, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books is from Amir to Sara.\n23. Therefore, the list of scholars in order from Amir to Sara, including Amir, is: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara"
