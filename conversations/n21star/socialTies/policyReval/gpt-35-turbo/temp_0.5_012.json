Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who have more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the current maximum.\n3. Check if Amir is connected to any scholars who have the same number of books as the current maximum. If yes, add them to the queue.\n4. Remove Amir from the queue.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's follow this process:\n\nStep 1: Start with Amir.\nStep 2: Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them have more books than the current maximum (0).\nStep 3: Add Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza to the queue.\nStep 4: Remove Amir from the queue.\n\nQueue: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n\nStep 2: Wim is connected to Jing.
