Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Prem has the higher number of books, we'll aim to reach him first.\n\nStep 1: Begin at Amir. \nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. We need to find which of these individuals can eventually connect us to Prem.\n\nStep 2: Check Amir's connections. \nOut of Amir's connections, only Wei is connected to someone that can connect us to Prem. Wei is connected to Eva, who is connected to Prem. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem. \n\nNow, let's list these scholar names in order, separated by commas. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

We need to find which of these individuals can eventually connect us to Sara.\n\nStep 2: Check Amir's connections.\nAmir does not have a direct connection to Sara or a connection to any of Sara's connections (Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja). Therefore, we need to see if there is a scholar connected to both one of Amir's connections and one of Sara's connections.\n\nStep 3: Look for overlapping connections.\nNisha, one of Amir's connections, is connected to Wim and Raj, who are also connected to Amir. Therefore, we will examine the connections of Wim and Raj to find a path to Sara.\n\nStep 4: Examine Wim and Raj's connections.\nRaj is connected to Jing and Wei, who are also connected to Amir. Wim is only connected to Jing. None of them connects directly to Sara or any of her connections.\n\nStep 5: Examine Jing and Wei's connections.\nJing is connected to Reza and Wim, who are connected to Amir. Wei is connected to Eva and Reza, and Eva is connected to Prem, Matt, Amy, and Gia. None of them connects directly to Sara or any of her connections.\n\nThe connections provided in the prompt do not establish a path from Amir to Sara. Therefore, it is not possible to reach Sara from Amir based on the connections provided.\n\nAnswer: There is no path to reach Sara from Amir based on the provided connections."
