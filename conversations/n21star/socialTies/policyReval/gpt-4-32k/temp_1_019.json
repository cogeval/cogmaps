Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Here, Prem has 50 books, and Moin has 10. Therefore, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem.\n\nStep 2: Determine who is connected to Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 3: Determine if any of these connections directly connect to Prem. None of Amir's immediate connections directly link to Prem.\n\nStep 4: Now, check the connections of each of Amir's connections to find a path to Prem. Wei is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Prem.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
