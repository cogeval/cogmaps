Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Nisha are directly connected to Reza.\n3. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n4. Jing is connected to Pam.\n5. Pam is connected to Moin.\n\nThe task mentioned that we should find the scholar with the maximum number of books. Among the mentioned scholars, Prem has 50 books and Moin has 10 books. So, Prem has the maximum number of books, but we are only connected through Moin. So, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is through Moin.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Moin is:\nAmir, Reza, Jing, Pam, Moin. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Jing, Pam, Moin"
