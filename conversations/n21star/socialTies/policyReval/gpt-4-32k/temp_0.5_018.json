Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Wim is connected to Jing. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is not directly connected to Prem, so I need to look at the next level of connections.\n\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Prem. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
