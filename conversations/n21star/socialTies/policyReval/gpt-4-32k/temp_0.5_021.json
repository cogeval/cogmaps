Therefore, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, let's find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. \n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Prem, so we need to look at their connections. \n3. Wim is connected to Jing, but Jing does not connect to Prem. \n4. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but none of these connect to Prem. \n5. Jing connects to Raj, Wei, Wim, and Reza, but none of these connect to Prem. \n6. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is directly connected to Prem. \n7. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of these connect to Prem. \n8. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.
