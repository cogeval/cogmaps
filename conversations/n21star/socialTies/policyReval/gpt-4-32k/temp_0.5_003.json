Prem is donating 50 books, while Moin is donating 10. Therefore, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, I will find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. I will start from Amir and look for connections to Prem:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. None of these scholars are directly connected to Prem.\n3. I will then look at the connections of Amir's connections:\n   - Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n   - Raj is directly connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - Jing is not directly connected to Prem.\n   - Wei is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - Nisha is directly connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Reza is directly connected to Wim, and Jing.\n   - None of these scholars are directly connected to Prem.\n4. I will then look at the connections of Amir's second-level connections:\n   - Jing is directly connected to Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim, and Pam.\n   - Wei is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - Reza is directly connected to Wim, and Jing.\n   - Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n   - None of these scholars are directly connected to Prem.\n5.
