Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

According to the information given, Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. So, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nStarting from Amir, we need to trace the path to Prem through the connections. \n\nHere is the sequence of connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Neither Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, nor Reza are directly connected to Prem. \n3. However, Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, Wim is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Pam.\n4. Pam is connected to Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n5. Neither Kim, Ian, Moin, nor Puja are directly connected to Prem.\n6. But, Puja is connected to Pari, and Pari is connected to Amy.\n7. Amy is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Prem.\n  \nSo the shortest path from Amir to Prem would be Amir -> Reza -> Wim -> Jing -> Pam -> Puja -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Pam, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem"
