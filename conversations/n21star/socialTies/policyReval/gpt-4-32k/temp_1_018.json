Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Those are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\nStep 2: Check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Prem or Moin (people with the most books). None of them are.\nStep 3: For each of Amir's connected scholars, identify the scholars that they are connected to. Repeat this process until you find a connection to either Prem or Moin.\nStep 4: After following the connections, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\nStep 5: Compare the number of books Prem and Moin have to find the one with the maximum number. Prem has 50 books and Moin has 10 books, so Prem has more books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
