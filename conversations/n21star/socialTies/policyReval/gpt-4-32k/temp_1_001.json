Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Hence, Prem is the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nWe need to figure out the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nLooking at the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Of these, Wim, Jing, and Reza are connected to Prem via others but Wei is directly connected to Prem. So the shortest path will be through Wei.\n\nThus, the path is Amir, Wei, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Prem"

Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Sara must be identified.\n\nLooking at the connections:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. None of these are directly connected to Sara, so we have to look for a path through someone who is connected to one of Amir's direct connections.\n\nUpon examining the connections:\n\n1. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n2. Among them, Pari is connected to Amy and Amy is connected to Matt.\n3. Matt is connected to Zack.\n4. Zack is connected to Eva and Eva is connected to Wei.\n5. Finally, Wei is directly connected to Amir.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is Amir, Wei, Eva, Zack, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Zack, Matt, Amy, Pari, Sara"
