Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

According to the information provided, Prem has the most books. \n\nGiven the connections, I'll start with Amir and identify his connections. He is connected with Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nI will then check if any of these individuals is connected with Prem. Out of all those, Wei is connected to Eva, but Eva is not directly connected with Prem. So, Wei is not a potential option.\n\nNisha is not directly connected to anyone who has a connection with Prem.\n\nReza, Wim, and Raj are only connected to people among Amir's connections.\n\nHowever, Jing is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Puja. And Puja is finally connected to Prem. So, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is through Jing, Pam, Puja, and then Prem.\n\nUsing this analysis, the scholar names in order from Amir to the scholar with the maximum books, Prem are Amir, Jing, Pam, Puja, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Puja, Prem."

Unfortunately, none of Amir's direct connections are directly or indirectly connected to Sara. \n\nTherefore, there is no path from Amir to Sara according to the information given.
