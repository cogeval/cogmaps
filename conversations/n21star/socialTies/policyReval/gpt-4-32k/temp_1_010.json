Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

So, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nNow we need to look at those who are directly connected to Amir, and see if they are directly connected to Prem. None of Amir's connections are directly connected to Prem.\n\nNow, we need to look at those who are directly connected to those who are directly connected to Amir and see if they are connected to Prem.\n\nThe scholars directly connected to Amir's connections are:\n\nWim -> Jing\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nJing -> Wei, Reza, Wim, Raj, Pam\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nReza -> Wim, Jing\n\nNow, from this list, we can see that Wei is connected to Eva and Eva is connected to Prem. So, we have our shortest path from Amir to Prem:\n\nAmir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem\n\nSo, starting from Amir, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books is through Wei, Eva, and then Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Therefore, we need to go one step further and look at third degree connections:\n\n- Jing, who is connected to Pam.\n- Pam, who is connected to Sara.\n\nSo, our shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the most books (Sara) is Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara"
