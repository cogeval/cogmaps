Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. We look at Amir's connections and find that none of them are directly connected to Prem. We will need to find a path through one or more of Amir's connections.\n\nWe list Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nLooking at the connections of each of these scholars, we find that Wim, Raj, Jing, and Reza have no connection to Prem. Nisha and Wei are connected to Amir but they also don't have any direct connection with Prem. \n\nExamining Wei's connections, we find that Wei is connected to Eva who has a direct connection to Prem. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is through Wei and Eva.\n\nFollowing this path, the scholar names in order are: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

Wim is connected to Jing but Jing is not connected to Sara.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing and Wei but neither are connected to Sara.\n3. Jing is connected to Wei and Reza, but neither Wei nor Reza are connected to Sara.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza and Eva. Eva is not connected to Sara, but Reza is connected to Wim who is connected to Jing.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei but none of them are connected to Sara.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing but neither Wim nor Jing are connected to Sara.\n\nThe above connections don't lead to Sara. \n\nTo find the path to Sara, we can check if any of the scholars connected to Sara is connected to any of the scholars connected to Amir:\n\n1. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n2. From these, only Pam is connected to Jing who is connected to Amir.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is through Jing and Pam. \n\nSo, the order of scholars is: Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Sara."
