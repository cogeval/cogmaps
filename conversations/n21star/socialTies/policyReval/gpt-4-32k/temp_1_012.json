Hence, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nStep 2: Map out connections from Amir: Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 3: Look for connections from these scholars to Prem: Among them, only Wei is connected to someone who is connected to Prem, who is Eva.\n\nStep 4: Plan the shortest path: The shortest path from Amir to Prem (with the maximum books) will be Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\n"
