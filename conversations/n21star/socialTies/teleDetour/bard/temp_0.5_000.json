Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Raj, Jing, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Pam has an instant connection portal, through which she can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time.\n3. Prem is donating 50 books, which is the maximum number of books among all the scholars.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir, Pam, Prem.\n\nHere is the output in the required format:\n\n```\nAnswer: Amir, Pam, Prem\n```\n\nNote that this is the shortest path that allows you to take books from only one person. If you were allowed to take books from multiple people, then the shortest path would be Amir, Pam, Wei, Prem. This is because Wei is connected to Prem, so you could take books from both of them in one step.
