Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This is how you will work it out.\n\nThe only problem with this solution is that it gives us an unordered list of all the paths. To get an ordered list of all the paths, we need to apply a sorting algorithm.\n\nThe basic idea that if the first character of the two strings is the same, then we are at the end of the path. So we compare the next characters, and if they are also the same, then we will return a result.\n\nHere the ordering of the output is the first path with the largest number of books in the end is returned.\n\nIn this article, we learned about Backtracking and how to solve a problem using it. The technique of backtracking is very powerful and it can be applied to a variety of problems. Backtracking can be applied to solve a variety of problems and is very useful in coding interviews.\n\nThis is a guide to Backtracking in Java. Here we discuss the introduction and different examples of backtracking in java with code implementation. You can also go through our other related articles to learn more \u2013\n\nThis is a guide"
