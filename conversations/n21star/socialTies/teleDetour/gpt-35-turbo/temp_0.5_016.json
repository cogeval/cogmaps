We will stop the search once we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of books.\n\nThe breadth-first search algorithm will visit the scholars in the following order:\n\nAmir -> Wim -> Jing -> Wei -> Reza -> Eva -> Matt -> Prem\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, Eva, Matt, Prem"
