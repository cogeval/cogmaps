We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 1, Wei = 1, Nisha = 1, Reza = 1.\n4. Explore Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n5. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 2, Nisha = 1, Reza = 1, Eva = 3.\n6. Explore Raj's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n7. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 2, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3.\n8. Explore Jing's connections: Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n9. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3.\n10. Explore Wei's connections: Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n11. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3.\n12. Explore Nisha's connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n13. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3.\n14. Explore Reza's connections: Wim and Jing.\n15. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3.\n16. Explore Eva's connections: Matt, Amy, Gia, and Wei.\n17. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3, Matt = 4, Amy = 4, Gia = 4.\n18. Explore Matt's connections: Eva and Amy.\n19. Calculate the distance from Amir to each connected scholar: Wim = 1, Raj = 1, Jing = 2, Wei = 3, Nisha = 1, Reza = 2, Eva = 3, Matt = 4, Amy = 4, Gia = 4.\n20. Explore Amy's connections: Matt.\n21.
