You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current_scholar variable.\n   b. Check if the current_scholar has more books than the previous maximum.\n      - If yes, update the previous maximum to the current_scholar's number of books and update the shortest path to the current_scholar.\n   c.
