Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

However, we don't have any information about their book donations.\n\nWe do know that Prem is donating 50 books, and Moin is donating 10 books. So, the person with the maximum number of books will be either Prem or the person connected to Prem.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we need to identify the connections that lead to Prem or the person connected to Prem. Let's analyze the connections:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, who is connected to Jing. \n2. Jing is not connected to Prem, so we need to explore other connections.\n3. Amir is also connected to Nisha, who is connected to Reza. \n4. Reza is connected to Wim, who is connected to Jing. \n5. Jing is still not connected to Prem, so we need to explore other connections.\n6. Amir is connected to Raj, who is connected to Jing. \n7. Jing is still not connected to Prem, so we need to explore other connections.\n8. Amir is connected to Wei, who is connected to Eva. \n9. Eva is connected to Matt, who is connected to Prem. \n\nBased on this analysis, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is:\nAmir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."

Amir is connected to Wim.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is not connected to Prem, so we need to use the connection portal held by Pam.\n4. Connect with Pam.\n5.
