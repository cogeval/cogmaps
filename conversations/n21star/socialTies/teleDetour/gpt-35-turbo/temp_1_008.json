Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Remove the first scholar from the queue and call it the current scholar.\n   b. If the current scholar has the maximum number of books, stop and output the path.\n   c. Otherwise, check the connections of the current scholar that have not been visited. Add those scholars to the queue and mark them as visited. Also, keep track of the path from Amir to the current scholar.\n5.

We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path, considering the instant connection portal with Pam. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a priority queue to store the scholars to be visited, with the priority based on the minimum distance from Amir.\n2. Create a distance list to keep track of the minimum distance from Amir to each scholar. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for Amir, which is set to 0.\n3. Create a visited list to keep track of the scholars that have been visited.\n4. Add Amir to the priority queue.\n5. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   a. Remove the scholar with the minimum distance from the priority queue and call it the current scholar.\n   b. If the current scholar has the maximum number of books, stop and output the path.\n   c. Otherwise, check the connections of the current scholar that have not been visited. Update the minimum distance if a shorter path is found. Add those scholars to the priority queue.\n   d. If the current scholar is Pam, add all remaining scholars to the priority queue with the updated distances from Pam.\n   e. Mark the current scholar as visited.\n6.
