We also know that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books, but we don't have information about the number of books each person currently has.\n3. To find the scholar with the maximum number of books, we need to trace the connections and keep track of the number of books each scholar has received. Starting from Amir, we will follow the connections and note the total number of books at each step.\n\nNow let's find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nAmir -> Wim -> Eva (Amir -> Wim -> Wei -> Eva)\nEva has the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva"
