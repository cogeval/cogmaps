Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We will keep track of the distances from Amir to each scholar and their respective number of books. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Set the distances from Amir to all scholars as infinity, except for Amir himself, which is 0. Also, set the maximum number of books as 0 and the name of the person with the maximum number of books as empty.\n\n2. Starting from Amir, add him to a queue to explore the connected scholars. \n\n3. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and consider them as the current scholar.\n   - Check if the current scholar has more books than the current maximum. If yes, update the maximum number of books and the name of the person with the maximum number of books.\n   - For each scholar connected to the current scholar, check if their distance from Amir is infinity. If yes, update their distance as the distance of the current scholar plus one, and add them to the queue.\n\n4. Once the queue is empty, we have found the scholar with the maximum number of books. The shortest path from Amir to this scholar can be obtained by backtracking from the person with the maximum number of books to Amir, using the recorded distances. \n\nNow, let's execute these steps:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wei, Eva"

The shortest path from Amir to this scholar can be obtained by backtracking from the person with the maximum number of books to Amir, using the recorded distances.\n\nSince we have Pam's instant connection portal, we can use it to directly connect with any other scholar without any distance. Let's consider the maximum number of books scholar as \"X\" and Pam as \"P\". \n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Pam, X"
