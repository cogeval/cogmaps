We'll start with Amir and explore the connections one level at a time until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Check the connections of each scholar from step 2:\n   - Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Eva.\n   - Raj's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - Jing's connections: Wei, Reza, Wim, Pam, Raj, and Raj.\n   - Wei's connections: Reza, Wim, Eva, Jing, Raj, and Raj.\n   - Nisha's connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Reza's connections: Wim, Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n4. Check the connections of each scholar from step 3:\n   - Eva's connections: Matt, Amy, Gia, Prem, Wei, and Reza.\n   - Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n   - Matt's connections: Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n   - Amy's connections: Matt, Eva, Gia, and Pari.\n   - Gia's connections: Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n   - Prem's connections: Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n   - Kim's connections: Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n   - Ian's connections: Puja, Pari, and Kim.\n   - Moin's connections: Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n   - Puja's connections: Pari, Moin, Kim, and Ian.\n   - Pari's connections: Amy, Kim, Ian, and Puja.\n   - Ming's connections: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n5. Check the connections of each scholar from step 4:\n   - None of the scholars have any connections beyond this point.\n\nBased on the connections explored, the person with the maximum number of books is Prem, who is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is:\nAmir, Wim, Eva, Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Prem"
