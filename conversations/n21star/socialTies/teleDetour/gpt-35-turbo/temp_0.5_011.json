Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar has more books than the current maximum number of books, update the maximum number of books and the shortest path.\n   c. Enqueue all unvisited scholars connected to the current scholar.\n   d. Mark the current scholar as visited.\n4.
