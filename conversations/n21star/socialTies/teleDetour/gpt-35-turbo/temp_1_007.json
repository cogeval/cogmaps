Start with Amir.\n2. Check if Amir is connected to a person with more books. If yes, proceed to step 4. If no, proceed to step 3.\n3. Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to a person with more books. If yes, proceed to step 4. If no, proceed to step 5.\n4. Choose the person with the most books among the connections and add them to the path. If there is a tie, choose the person with the shortest name in alphabetical order. If the person with the most books is already on the path, go to step 5.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the person added to the path until there are no more connections to explore.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of them have more books, so proceed to step 3.\n3. Among Amir's connections, Nisha is connected to a person with more books (Reza), so add Nisha to the path.\n4. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. None of them have more books, so proceed to step 5.\n5. Among Reza's connections, Wim is connected to a person with more books (Eva), so add Wim to the path.\n6. Eva is connected to Amy and Matt.
