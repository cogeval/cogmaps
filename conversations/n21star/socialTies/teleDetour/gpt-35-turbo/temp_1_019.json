If not, check if Amir is connected to any scholar who is connected to a scholar with more books than the current maximum.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the maximum number of books.\n6.

None of them have more books than the current maximum.\nStep 3: None of Amir's immediate connections have more books than the current maximum.\nStep 4: Among Amir's immediate connections, Wim, Raj, Nisha, and Reza are connected to scholars with more books than the current maximum.\nStep 5: Let's continue exploring each of these connections.\n\nFor Wim:\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Jing is connected to Wei.\n- Wei is connected to Eva.\n- Eva is connected to Matt.\n- Matt has the maximum number of books.\n\nFor Raj:\n- Raj is connected to Jing.\n- Jing, as we've already explored, leads to Matt with the maximum number of books.\n\nFor Nisha:\n- Nisha is connected to Reza.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, but we've already explored this path.\n\nFor Reza:\n- Reza is connected to Wim, but we've already explored this path.\n\nStep 6: The shortest path from Amir to Matt, who has the maximum number of books, is Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt"
