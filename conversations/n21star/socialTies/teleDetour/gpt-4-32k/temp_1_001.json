Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Therefore, the shortest path will be to look for a connection to Matt, Eva or Amy through Amir's connections.\n\nChecking Amir's immediate connections, we see that Wei is connected to Eva.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem.\n\nThe complete path of scholars including Amir is \"Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem\". \n\nThis path represents the quickest way for Amir to reach the scholar with the maximum number of donated books. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Therefore, the previous path (Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem) is no longer viable.\n\nConsidering the new connection mechanism introduced via Pam (who can connect to any scholar directly), it's more efficient to go to Pam first. Pam is connected to Sara, who is one of Amir's connected scholars.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) would be: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem.\n\nThis path represents the quickest way for Amir to reach the scholar with the maximum number of donated books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem"
