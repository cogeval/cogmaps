Dan gives you his magic painting that can get you working with anyone you want only once. At the same time, you have been told that Dan and Kim are no longer working together. From Dan what is the path to the person you should work with to get the most reward? Please list the names in order, separated by commas."

Dan is working with Bob, Cal, Eva, Fay, and Gus.\n\nNow, since Dan and Kim are no longer working together, we can ignore any direct connection from Dan to Kim. We need to find the shortest path from Dan to Joe, as Joe can get us the art supplies worth $100 for free.\n\nLet's examine the connections of the people Dan is working with:\n\n2. Bob is working with Dan, Eva, Fay, Gus, and Cal.\n3. Cal is working with Dan, Eva, Gus, and Bob.\n4. Eva is working with Dan, Gus, Bob, and Zac.\n5. Fay is working with Dan, Gus, Bob, Cal, and Eva.\n6. Gus is working with Dan, Bob, and Cal.\n\nFrom the connections above, we can see that there are no direct connections to Joe. Therefore, we need to find the shortest path through the people Dan is working with. Let's examine their connections further:\n\n7. Zac is working with Sue, Tom, Kai, Liv, Pam, and Eva.\n8. Ola is working with Joe, Kim, Leo, Max, and Ned.\n9. Joe is working with Ian, Kim, Leo, Max, Ola, and Kai.\n\nFrom the connections above, we can see that Joe is working with Ola, and Ola is working with Kim. Since Kim is working with Dan, we have found the shortest path from Dan to Joe.\n\nAnswer: Dan, Kim, Ola, Joe"
