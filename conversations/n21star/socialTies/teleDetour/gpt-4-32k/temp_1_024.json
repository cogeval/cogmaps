Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The paths from Amir to Prem via the connections mentioned are:\n\n1. Amir - Reza - Wim - Jing - Wei - Eva - Matt - Prem (8 scholars)\n2. Amir - Wei - Reza - Wim - Jing - Eva - Matt - Prem (8 scholars)\n3. Amir - Nisha - Reza - Wim - Jing - Wei - Eva - Matt - Prem (9 scholars)\n4. Amir - Nisha - Wei - Reza - Wim - Jing - Eva - Matt - Prem (9 scholars)\n\nOut of all the possible paths, there are two shortest paths with 8 scholars each. We can choose any one of them. We'll choose the first path for this task.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"

You are also told that Pam has an instant connection portal, through which she can connect you to any scholar, but one at a time. This means that once you connect with Pam, then you can immediately connect with any other scholar. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir - Wei - Pam - Prem (4 scholars) (This path is not valid as it includes Wei)\n5. Amir - Raj - Pam - Prem (4 scholars)\n6. Amir - Jing - Pam - Prem (4 scholars)\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem using Pam's instant connection portal is through 4 scholars. We can choose any of them except the one that includes Wei. \n\nWe'll choose the first path: Amir, Reza, Pam, Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Pam, Prem"
