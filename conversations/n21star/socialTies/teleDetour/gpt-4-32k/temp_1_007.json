Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amy is connected to Matt, Matt is connected to Eva, but none of them have a connection with Amir's scholars.\n\nStep 4: The second scholar with books is Moin who has 10 books and he has connections with Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. None of these scholars have a direct connection with Amir's scholars.\n\nStep 5: Find a connection chain from Amir's scholars to Moin, who is the only scholar with books that can be reached from Amir: \n\nAmir -> Nisha -> Raj -> Jing -> Pam -> Moin \n\nIn conclusion, this path includes six scholars from Amir to Moin. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books he can reach is through Nisha, Raj, Jing, Pam, and Moin."
