Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Among Prem who is donating 50 books and Moin who is donating 10 books, it is clear that Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, I'll look at the connection list of Amir to find a connection to Prem. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nOut of these, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of these lead to Prem.\n\nJing is connected with Wim, Wei, and Reza (and through Raj, but Raj doesn't have any connection to Prem), none of them lead to Prem. \n\nWei is connected to Wim, Eva, and Reza. Eva is the first link to the group with Prem.\n\nEva is connected to Matt, Amy, Gia, and Prem. She directly connects to Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem would be: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nNow, let's put the scholar names in order, separated by commas. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."
