Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

If the target Prem is among them, we can stop. However, it appears none of Amir's connections is connected directly to Prem.\n\nThird, list each scholar's connections again and see if Prem is among them. Wim is connected to Jing, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, and Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nIn the fourth step, recognize that none of these scholars is connected to Prem either, so we go another level deeper. Now, Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Raj, Pam, and Wim. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\nIn the fifth step, notice that Wei is connected to Eva. Check Eva's connections and find that she is connected to Matt, Gia, Prem, and Amy.\n\nPrem is among Eva's connections, and Wei is among Amir's second-degree connections, so we've found the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Find a connection between Amir and Pam. Amir is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Pam.\n\nFinally, since Pam can connect us to any other scholar, she can directly connect us to Prem.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering the disagreement and Pam's portal, is now Amir, Jing, Pam, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Prem"
