Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. From this group, Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is directly connected to Pam.\n4. Pam is directly connected to Kim.\n5. Kim is directly connected to Ian.\n6. Ian is directly connected to Puja.\n7. Puja is directly connected to Pari.\n8. Pari is directly connected to Amy.\n9.
