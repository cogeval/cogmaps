Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the description, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nNext, I would need to track a path from these connected scholars to the scholar who has the maximum number of books, which is Prem. From all the scholars Amir is connected to, I need to find who is directly or indirectly connected to Prem.\n\nFrom the description, Ming is directly connected to Prem. None of the scholars connected to Amir is directly connected to Ming.\n\nHowever, I can see that Amir is connected to Wei, Wei is connected to Eva and Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Prem. So, the path from Amir to Prem will be Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem. \n\nIn this path, Amir to Wei is one step, Wei to Eva is the second step, Eva to Matt is the third step, and Matt to Prem is the fourth step, making it the shortest 4-step path from Amir to Prem. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books, Prem, is through Wei, Eva, and Matt."

The important point to note here is to identify a connection between Amir and Pam.\n\nFrom the information given, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these are directly connected to Pam.\n\nHowever, I notice that Sara is connected to Pam and Amir is connected to Reza and Reza to Wim, and Wim is connected to Sara, forming a connection path Amir, Reza, Wim, Sara, Pam.\n\nGiven Pam's instant connection portal, I can connect directly to Prem from Pam, therefore creating the new shortest path, which will be Amir, Reza, Wim, Sara, Pam, Prem.\n\nThis is a 5-step path from Amir to Prem."
