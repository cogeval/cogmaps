They are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nThen, I check who of these is connected to the scholars who have the most books. Prem has the most books, 50, and is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\nFrom Amir's connections, none is directly connected to Prem. I need to find a path from Amir's connections to Prem's connections.\n\nWim is not connected to any of Prem's connections. \nRaj is not connected to any of Prem's connections. \nJing is not connected to any of Prem's connections. \nWei is connected to Eva from Prem's connections. \nNisha is not connected to any of Prem's connections. \nReza is not connected to any of Prem's connections.\n\nHence, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is via Wei and Eva. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

Sara, in turn, is connected to Pam. As Pam has an instant connection portal, she can directly connect us to Prem. \n\nHence, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is now via Nisha, Sara, Pam, and then directly to Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Sara, Pam, Prem."
