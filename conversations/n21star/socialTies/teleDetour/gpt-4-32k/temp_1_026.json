According to the information given:\n\nAmir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these individuals are directly connected to Prem.\n\nAmong the individuals that Amir is directly connected to, Wei is directly connected to Eva. Eva is directly connected to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) would be: Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem. \n\nFollowing the regular expression format given:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
