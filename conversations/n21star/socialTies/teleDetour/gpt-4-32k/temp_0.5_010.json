Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. Looking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these scholars is directly connected to Prem.\n\nHowever, Wei is connected to Eva, who is connected to Matt, who is in turn connected to Prem. This seems to be the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nSo, the order of scholars from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
