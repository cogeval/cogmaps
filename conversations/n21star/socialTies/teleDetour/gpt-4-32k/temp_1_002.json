Based on the information provided, Prem is donating the maximum number of books (50 books). So, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. \n\nStep 1: Identify the scholars connected with Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Of the scholars connected to Amir, identify who has a connection with Prem. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nStep 3: From the scholars connected to Wei, identify who is connected with Prem. Eva is connected with Prem.\n\nStep 4: The shortest path from Amir to Prem is therefore: Amir to Wei to Eva to Prem.\n\nConverting this path to the required format: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

However, Pam has an instant connection portal which allows immediate connection to any other scholar.\n\nStep 1: Identify the scholars connected with Amir. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, and now Pam.\n\nStep 2: Use Pam's portal to connect directly to the scholar with the maximum books. That scholar is Prem.\n\nStep 3: The shortest path from Amir to Prem is therefore now: Amir to Pam to Prem.\n\nConverting this path to the required format: Amir, Pam, Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Pam, Prem."
