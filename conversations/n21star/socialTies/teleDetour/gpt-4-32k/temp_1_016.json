Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This is Prem, who is donating 50 books. \n\nStep 2: Identify Amir's connections. They are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nStep 3: Identify connections to Prem. The scholars connected to Prem are Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\nStep 4: Looking at the two lists from steps 2 and 3, we can see that none of Amir's connections are directly connected to Prem. So, we have to find a common connection.\n\nStep 5: Look for the shortest path that connects Amir to Prem. There are multiple paths but the shortest is as follows: Amir -> Reza -> Wim -> Jing -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Reza, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Pam has a unique instant connection portal and can connect us to any scholar.\n\nStep 4: Identify connections to Pam. According to the original information, Sara is connected to Pam.\n\nStep 5: Find the shortest path from Amir to Prem considering the new circumstances. Amir can connect to Pam via Sara and then to Prem instantly through Pam's connection portal. The shortest path is Amir -> Sara -> Pam -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem"
