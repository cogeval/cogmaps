Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

We need to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books, given the connections between the scholars.\n\n1. Identify the person who has the maximum number of books. Between Prem who is donating 50 books, and Moin who is donating 10 books, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\n2. Now, find the path from Amir to Prem. The path should be as short as possible.\n\n3. Looking at the connections, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n4. Prem is directly connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\n5. After examining all connections, a path from Amir to Prem emerges: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem. This path includes only three connections, which appears to be the shortest possible.\n\nNow, provide the answer.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."

Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Since Wei and Eva are no longer connected, the previous shortest path from Amir to Prem (Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem) is no longer valid.\n\n2. Now, since Pam has an instant connection portal, she can connect you to any scholar, one at a time. This means once connected with Pam, you can immediately connect with Prem.\n\n3. The path to Pam from Amir is Amir -> Sara -> Pam. \n\n4. Once connected with Pam, you can instantly connect with Prem.\n\nSo, the new shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir -> Sara -> Pam -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem."
