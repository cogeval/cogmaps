Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

This won't lead us to Prem.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. This also won't lead us to Prem.\n- Jing is not connected to Prem either.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Eva is connected to Prem. So, we can go from Amir to Wei, then Eva, and then Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, but this doesn't provide a shorter path to Prem.\n- Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Again, this doesn't provide a path to Prem.\n\nAmong all these possibilities, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Since Wei and Eva are no longer connected, we need to find a new path from Amir to Prem. \n\nNow we know that Pam has an instant connection portal, which can connect us to any scholar, so Pam becomes crucial to our new path.\n\nAmir's immediate connections are Wim, Raj, Jing, Nisha, and Reza. Sara is connected to Pam. Therefore, we can go from Amir to Sara and then to Pam. Using Pam's portal, we can directly connect with Prem. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering the new circumstances, is: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Pam, Prem"
