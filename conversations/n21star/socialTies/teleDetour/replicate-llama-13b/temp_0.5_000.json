Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, and Jing.\n\nThird, I will consider the donations of Prem and Moin. Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nBased on the information above, I will now calculate the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Prem (50+10=60 books)\n\nThe shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books is from Amir to Prem, with a total of 60 books.

This path includes Amir, Wim, Jing, Reza, Nisha, and Prem.\n\nHowever, with the additional information that Pam has an instant connection portal, we can further optimize the path by connecting with Pam first, and then connecting to any other scholar.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Reza, Nisha, Prem (50+10=60 books), then connect to Pam, and then connect to any other scholar of your choice.\n\nThe shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books, taking into account the instant connection portal of Pam, is to first connect to Pam, and then connect to any other scholar of your choice. This will give you access to all the books in the network, including the 50 books donated by Prem and the 10 books donated by Moin."
