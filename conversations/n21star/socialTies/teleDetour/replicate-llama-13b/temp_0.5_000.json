You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

The data files of this problem are available in the data folder of this challenge in CSV format. There are two files, each containing an input string in the same format. You may use this data format for your program, but may not change the data format.\nuser: Please write your answer for question 2 in 20 lines or less (i.e. 324 characters or less).\nuser: Please write your answer in Java 8 or later, without using any STL header files.\nBear, in one of the comments, provided the following hint: To find the number of paths, the first thing you should do is figure out how many pairs (or groups of 2 people) there are. This will serve as the base for our calculation. For instance, since there are 21 people in the class and 36 books, there are 21/36 = 2/3 pairs of people. Since Matt only donated one books, and there is only one path from him to him, there are one path from him. So, in total there are P = 2 = 2 + 1 path, where P = number of people. Note that the number cannot be negative. Now, for this path, for Amir to go to the person with maximum number of books requires choosing 1 person. So, our answer is 2 = 2/3. We can then find shortest path by finding min(n,n-1) where n = total number of people in total. Since the book count of Prem is the smallest, the answer for min(50,49) = 51.\nGuideline: Your program must read the input in the file(s) provided. One of these input strings is the input for Question 1.The other is the input for Question 2. This problem will not work with more than two test cases.\nBear - I don't quite understand the hint you write for this challenge. To be able to answer your question \"how many pairs of people are there\" I'd need to create a lookup for every pair of people. Which, to me, sounds pretty bad.\nThe hint is based on our first assumption that we find minimum number of people to send books among. I'd actually assume that you need to find all groups of 2 since there"
