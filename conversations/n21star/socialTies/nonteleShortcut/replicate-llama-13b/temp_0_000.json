Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

The final answer is 'Reza, Jing', while the answer that is accepted is 'Raj, Jing, Reza, Wim'. Am I missing something? Thank you\nI think there were mistakes in the test case for the problem.\nAnd I think the problem should be edited, because it asks us to get the shortest path, but if we pick more than one connection, it always returns the path with the biggest length.\nI have uploaded an image to explain it.\nIn that case what would be the correct answer?\nHere testcase 3, you can find the shortest path between two people who are giving and they don't exchange books. Since this is the shortest path and this is not what is wanted the answer of this test case should be accepted. What is wrong with this code?\nWhat is correct answer? Can you please specify a problem?\nI updated the test case, and the shorted path would be 'Raj, Jing' and 'Reza, Jing'. Thank you.\nHi Shadab, I have modified test case 3 to match the original description of the shortest path. I have put all the changes (line removed and added) on http://pastie.org/8334652#1-1. Please comment if I am wrong."
