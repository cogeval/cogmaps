Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

None of these scholars are connected to either Prem or Moin, who are the ones donating books. Therefore, we need to find indirect connections. \n\nLooking at the connections of the scholars Amir is directly connected to, I see that Wei is connected to Eva. Eva is then connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Prem who is donating the maximum number of books. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."

Since Vivian is connected to these scholars, Amir now has a direct connection to them through Vivian.\n\nPrem is the person with the maximum number of books.
