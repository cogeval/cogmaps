Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Based on these connections, Wim and Wei seem to have the most connections (5 connections each) that could potentially get us to Prem (who has the maximum books, i.e., 50 books) faster. \n3. Checking Wim's and Wei's connections, we see that Wei is connected to Eva. Eva is connected to Matt and Matt is connected to Prem. \n4. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir - Wei - Eva - Matt - Prem.\n\nTherefore, the scholar names in order are Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem."
