Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the information provided, Prem has the maximum number of books i.e., 50. So, the goal is to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nThe connections are as follows:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- It is observed that Amir is directly connected to Wei and Zack is directly connected to Prem. Hence, if we can find a connection between Amir and Zack through Wei, then we can reach Prem in the shortest path.\n\nLooking at the connections, we find the path is as follows:\n\nAmir -> Wei -> Eva -> Matt -> Prem\n\nThis seems to be the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books (Prem).\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"
