Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Review each of these connections for possible routes to Prem who has the maximum number of books.\n3. Only Wei is directly connected to someone (Eva) who is connected to Prem. However, this path leads to a person who doesn't have the maximum number of books.\n4. A closer review shows that Amir is connected to Wim, who is connected to Jing.\n5. Jing is then connected to Raj.\n6. Raj is then connected to Wei.\n7. From Wei, it's a direct connection to Eva and then to Prem.\n8. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is Amir -> Wim -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nTherefore the answer is:\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Eva, Prem"
