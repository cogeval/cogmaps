Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: From these scholars, identify who they are connected to. \n\n- Wim is connected to Jing. \n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. \n- Jing doesn't have any other connections mentioned. \n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. \n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nStep 3: Continue the process, but remember that the goal is to reach either Prem (who has 50 books) or Moin (who has 10 books), we focus more on connections leading to them. \n\n- Only Wei is connected to Eva.\n- Eva is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nStep 4: This process leads us to the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum books. So, the shortest path to the person with the maximum books (Prem) is: Amir to Wei, Wei to Eva, Eva to Matt, and Matt to Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"

Amir, being married to Vivian, has direct access to her connections.
