Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.

Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

According to the provided information, Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books, so Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, starting from Amir, I need to find the shortest path to Prem. Let's examine Amir's connections. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Now I will check each of these connections to see if they are directly connected to Prem. \n\nNone of them are directly connected to Prem. So, I need to move to the second degree of separation. Looking at the connections of Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza, I see that Wei is connected to Eva.\n\nChecking Eva's connections, I see that she is connected to Prem. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is through Wei and Eva.\n\nFollowing this path, the order of the scholars is Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"

Therefore, Vivian is also connected to these scholars.\n\nNow, we need to find a link from Amir to Vivian. Since Amir just got married to Vivian, we can assume that they are connected. Thus, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is now through Vivian.\n\nSo, the order of scholars is Amir, Vivian, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem"
