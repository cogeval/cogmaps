Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nSecondly, I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. \n\nHere are the connections for Amir:\n\nAmir -> Wim\nAmir -> Raj\nAmir -> Jing\nAmir -> Wei\nAmir -> Nisha\nAmir -> Reza\n\nReviewing the information given, I see that Prem is connected to Eva, Matt and Amy but none of these people are in Amir's immediate circle.\n\nNext, I would look at the people connected to Prem's group. \n\nEva -> Zack\nMatt -> Zack\nAmy -> Zack, Gia\n\nUpon further analysis, Gia is also connected to Zack. So we can consider Zack as our intermediary for the shortest path.\n\nNow let's see who is Zack connected to from Amir's group:\n\nZack -> Amir\n\nBased on this information, the shortest path from Amir to the person with maximum books (Prem) is: \n\nAmir -> Zack -> Prem\n\nSo, the answer is:\nAnswer: Amir, Zack, Prem"

According to the provided information, Matt is connected to Zack, Eva, Amy and Prem.\n\nThat means Vivian is connected to Zack, Eva, Amy and Prem. \n\nSince Amir is married to Vivian, it means Amir is directly connected to Vivian and via Vivian, he's connected to Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir -> Vivian -> Prem\n\nAnswer: Amir, Vivian, Prem"
