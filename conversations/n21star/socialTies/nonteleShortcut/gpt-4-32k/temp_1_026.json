Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Let's start with Amir:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Raj. \n2. Raj is connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is connected to Pam.\n4. Pam is connected to Moin.\n  \nMoin has the least books (10 books) between the two largest donors. Therefore, we need to find a path to Prem:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Raj.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is connected to Pam.\n4. Pam is connected to Kim.\n5. Kim is connected to Ian.\n6. Ian is connected to Puja.\n7. Puja is connected to Pari.\n8. Pari is connected to Amy.\n9. Amy is connected to Matt.\n10. Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the most books (Prem) is: Amir, Raj, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem."
