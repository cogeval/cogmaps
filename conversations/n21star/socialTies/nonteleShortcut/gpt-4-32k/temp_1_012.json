To find this, I will look at the connections given and identify the shortest path. \n\n1. The first step is to identify Amir's connections. According to the information given, Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n2. The next step is to see if any of these persons are directly connected to Prem. None of Amir's direct connections have Prem as a connection.\n\n3. The third step is to look at the second-degree connections. The connections of Amir's connections need to be examined. Zack is connected to Prem, and Zack is connected to Matt. Matt is a second-degree connection to Amir through Jing.\n\n4. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Prem is Amir -> Jing -> Matt -> Zack -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Matt, Zack, Prem"
