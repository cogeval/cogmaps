Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the number of books each scholar has. Set the value of Amir's books to 0.\n4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of books encountered so far. Set it to 0.\n5. Start a loop while the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. Check if the scholar has more books than the maximum number of books encountered so far. If yes, update the maximum number of books and set the path to this scholar as the shortest path.\n   c.
