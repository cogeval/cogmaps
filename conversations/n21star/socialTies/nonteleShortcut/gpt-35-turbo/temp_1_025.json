We'll start by creating a list of all scholars and their corresponding book donations. \n\nScholar Book Donations:\nAmir - 0 books\nWim - 0 books\nRaj - 0 books\nJing - 0 books\nWei - 0 books\nNisha - 0 books\nReza - 0 books\nSara - 0 books\nPari - 0 books\nPam - 0 books\nKim - 0 books\nIan - 0 books\nMoin - 10 books\nPuja - 0 books\nZack - 0 books\nMatt - 0 books\nEva - 0 books\nAmy - 0 books\nGia - 0 books\nMing - 0 books\nPrem - 50 books\n\nNext, we'll create a graph representation of the connections between scholars. \n\nGraph:\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\nNow, we'll use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. We'll keep track of the distance from Amir to each scholar and also the path followed to reach each scholar. \n\nBFS Algorithm:\n1. Initialize a queue to store the scholars to be visited.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the distance from Amir to each scholar.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the path followed to reach each scholar.\n4. Enqueue Amir to the queue and set its distance as 0.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   6. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   7. If the scholar has the maximum number of books, stop the BFS.\n   8. For each connected scholar not yet visited:\n      9. Calculate the distance from Amir to the connected scholar.\n      10. If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance stored, update the distance and path.\n      11. Enqueue the connected scholar to the queue.\n12. Return the path followed from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nUsing the BFS algorithm, we find that the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books (Prem) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Zack, Ming, Prem"
