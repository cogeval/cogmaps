Initialize a queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Initialize an empty list to track the shortest path.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   4. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   5. If the scholar has the maximum number of books, add them to the shortest path list and stop the algorithm.\n   6. Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar, if they have not been visited yet, enqueue them and update their number of books.\n7. Return the shortest path list.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is as follows:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Wei, Eva, Prem"
