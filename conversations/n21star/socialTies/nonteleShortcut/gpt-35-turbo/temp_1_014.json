Initialize a queue and enqueue Amir.\n2. Initialize an empty list to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Initialize a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has donated.\n4. Initialize variables to store the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n5. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 6-8.\n6. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n7. If the dequeued scholar is not in the visited list, add them to the visited list and check if they have donated more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n8. Enqueue all the connections of the dequeued scholar that are not in the visited list.\n9.
