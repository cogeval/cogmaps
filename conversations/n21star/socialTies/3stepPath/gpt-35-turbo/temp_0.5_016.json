Check if Wim is directly connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Gia.\n3. If not, check the connections of Wim and add them to a queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue.\n5. Check if this scholar is directly connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, followed by this scholar, and then Gia.\n6. If not, add the connections of this scholar to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until Gia is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Wim is not directly connected to Gia.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing, Wei, and Eva. Add them to the queue.\n4. Take the first scholar from the queue: Jing.\n5. Jing is not directly connected to Gia.\n6. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Raj, and Wim. Add them to the queue.\n7. Take the first scholar from the queue: Wei.\n8. Wei is not directly connected to Gia.\n9. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Add them to the queue.\n10. Take the first scholar from the queue: Reza.\n11. Reza is not directly connected to Gia.\n12. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Add them to the queue.\n13. Take the first scholar from the queue: Wim.\n14. Wim is directly connected to Gia.\n15.
