Check if Wim is directly connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is just Wim and Matt.\n3. If not, check the connections of Wim's neighbors (Jing, Wei, and Reza). Add them to a queue.\n4. Take the first neighbor from the queue (Jing) and check if Jing is directly connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is Wim, Jing, and Matt. If not, add Jing's neighbors (Raj, Wei, and Reza) to the queue.\n5. Repeat step 4 for each neighbor in the queue until Matt is found or the queue is empty.\n\nApplying these steps:\n\n1. Wim is directly connected to Jing, Wei, and Reza. Add them to the queue: Jing, Wei, Reza.\n2. Take the first neighbor from the queue (Jing). Jing is directly connected to Matt, so the shortest path is Wim, Jing, Matt.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Matt"
