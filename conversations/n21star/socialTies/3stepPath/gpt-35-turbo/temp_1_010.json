Starting from Wim, we will consider Wim as the root of our search tree.\n2. We will maintain a queue to store the scholars we need to visit. Initially, we enqueue Wim.\n3. We will also maintain a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited. Initially, Wim is marked as visited.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   b. Check if the dequeued scholar is Kim. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\n   c. If the dequeued scholar is not Kim, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Kim is not found, it means there is no path from Wim to Kim.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we will find the shortest path from Wim to Kim.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Raj, Jing, Kim"
