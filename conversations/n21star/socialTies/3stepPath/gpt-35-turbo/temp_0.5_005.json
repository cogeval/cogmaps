Create a queue to store the scholars we need to visit.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the scholars we have already visited.\n3. Enqueue Amir into the queue and add him to the visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Matt, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar who have not been visited yet and add them to the visited set.\n5. If we have finished the loop without finding Matt, it means there is no path from Amir to Matt.\n\nNow, let's execute the algorithm:\n\n1. Queue: [Amir]\n2. Visited: {Amir}\n\nIteration 1:\n- Dequeue Amir\n- Enqueue Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza}\n\nIteration 2:\n- Dequeue Wim\n- Enqueue Jing, Wei, Eva\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 3:\n- Dequeue Raj\n- Enqueue Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 4:\n- Dequeue Jing\n- Enqueue Wei, Reza, Wim\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 5:\n- Dequeue Wei\n- Enqueue Reza, Wim, Eva\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 6:\n- Dequeue Nisha\n- Enqueue Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 7:\n- Dequeue Reza\n- Enqueue Wim, Jing\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva}\n\nIteration 8:\n- Dequeue Eva\n- Enqueue Matt\n- Visited: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Eva, Matt}\n\nThe algorithm stops here because we have found Matt.
