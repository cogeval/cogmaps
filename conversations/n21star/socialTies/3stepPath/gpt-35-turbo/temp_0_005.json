If yes, the shortest path is just Amir and Matt.\n3. If not, check Amir's connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza).\n4. Add Amir's connections to a queue.\n5. Take the first scholar from the queue (Wim) and check if Wim is connected to Matt. If yes, the shortest path is Amir, Wim, and Matt.\n6. If not, add Wim's connections (Jing, Wei, and Eva) to the queue.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until Matt is found or the queue is empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, here is the shortest path from Amir to Matt:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Eva, Matt"
