Raj is directly connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n2. Among these connections, we need to identify who among them is connected to Sara.\n3. Wim is directly connected to Jing, so we check if Jing is connected to Sara.\n4. Jing is not directly connected to Sara, so we move on to the next connection of Wim.\n5. Reza is directly connected to Wim, but he is not connected to Sara either.\n6. Wei is directly connected to Wim, but he is also not connected to Sara.\n7. Since none of Raj's direct connections are connected to Sara, we need to check the connections of Jing, Reza, and Wei.\n8. Jing is directly connected to Wei, so we check if Wei is connected to Sara.\n9. Wei is not directly connected to Sara, so we move on to the next connection of Jing.\n10. Jing is not connected to any scholars connected to Sara, so we move on to Reza.\n11. Reza is directly connected to Wim, so we check if Wim is connected to Sara.\n12. Wim is directly connected to Sara, so we have found the shortest path from Raj to Sara.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Raj to Sara, starting from Raj, is:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wim, Sara"
