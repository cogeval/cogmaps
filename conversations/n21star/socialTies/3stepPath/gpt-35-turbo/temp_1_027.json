Check Raj's connections: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim.\n3. Since Ming is not in Raj's connections, we continue to the next level of connections.\n4. Check Jing's connections: Wei, Reza, Wim, Raj.\n5. Since Ming is not in Jing's connections, we continue to the next level of connections.\n6. Check Wei's connections: Reza, Wim, Eva.\n7. Since Ming is not in Wei's connections, we continue to the next level of connections.\n8. Check Reza's connections: Wim, Jing.\n9. Since Ming is not in Reza's connections, we continue to the next level of connections.\n10. Check Wim's connections: Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza.\n11.
