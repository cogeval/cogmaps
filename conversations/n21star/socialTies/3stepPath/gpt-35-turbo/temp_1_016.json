Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent of each scholar.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the first scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is Gia, break the loop.\n   c. If the scholar has not been visited:\n      - Mark the scholar as visited.\n      - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n      - Set the parent of each connected scholar as the current scholar.\n5. If Gia was found, construct the shortest path by following the parent pointers from Gia to Wim.\n6. Return the shortest path.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from Wim to Gia is:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Reza, Nisha, Wei, Gia"
