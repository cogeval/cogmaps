Create an empty queue and enqueue Amir.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty path list to store the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Kim, we have found the shortest path. Append the scholar to the path list and break the loop.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Mark the scholar as visited.\n     - Append the scholar to the path list.\n     - Enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar.\n6. If no path is found, return \"No path found.\"\n\nNow let's execute the algorithm:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Enqueue Amir.\n3. Mark Amir as visited.\n4. Append Amir to the path list: Amir.\n5. Enqueue Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n6. Dequeue Wim.\n7. Mark Wim as visited.\n8. Append Wim to the path list: Amir, Wim.\n9. Enqueue Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza, and Nisha.\n10. Dequeue Raj.\n11. Mark Raj as visited.\n12. Append Raj to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj.\n13. Enqueue Jing, Wei, Reza, and Nisha.\n14. Dequeue Jing.\n15. Mark Jing as visited.\n16. Append Jing to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing.\n17. Enqueue Wei, Reza, and Nisha.\n18. Dequeue Wei.\n19. Mark Wei as visited.\n20. Append Wei to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei.\n21. Enqueue Reza and Nisha.\n22. Dequeue Reza.\n23. Mark Reza as visited.\n24. Append Reza to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza.\n25. Enqueue Nisha.\n26. Dequeue Nisha.\n27. Mark Nisha as visited.\n28. Append Nisha to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Nisha.\n29. Enqueue Pari and Kim.\n30. Dequeue Pari.\n31. Mark Pari as visited.\n32. Append Pari to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Nisha, Pari.\n33. Enqueue Kim.\n34. Dequeue Kim.\n35. Mark Kim as visited.\n36. Append Kim to the path list: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Nisha, Pari, Kim.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Kim is: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Nisha, Pari, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Nisha, Pari, Kim."
