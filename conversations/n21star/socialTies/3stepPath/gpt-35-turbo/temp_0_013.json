Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Puja, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue all their connected scholars.\n5. If the algorithm reaches this point, it means there is no path from Wim to Puja.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Mark Wim as visited.\n4. Dequeue Wim.\n5. Wim is connected to Jing, Wei, and Eva. Enqueue Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n6. Mark Jing, Wei, and Eva as visited.\n7. Dequeue Jing.\n8. Jing is connected to Reza. Enqueue Reza.\n9. Mark Reza as visited.\n10. Dequeue Wei.\n11. Wei is connected to Reza and Eva. Enqueue Reza and Eva.\n12. Dequeue Eva.\n13. Eva is connected to Matt. Enqueue Matt.\n14. Mark Matt as visited.\n15. Dequeue Reza.\n16. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Enqueue Wim and Jing.\n17. Dequeue Matt.\n18. Matt is connected to Eva. Enqueue Eva.\n19. Dequeue Wim.\n20. Wim has already been visited, so skip.\n21. Dequeue Jing.\n22. Jing has already been visited, so skip.\n23. Dequeue Eva.\n24. Eva has already been visited, so skip.\n25. Dequeue Reza.\n26. Reza has already been visited, so skip.\n27. Dequeue Matt.\n28. Matt has already been visited, so skip.\n29.
