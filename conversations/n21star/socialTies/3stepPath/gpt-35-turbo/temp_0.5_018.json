Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent of each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Prem, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the current scholar that has not been visited, do the following:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar to the back of the queue.\n     - Set the parent of the connected scholar as the current scholar in the dictionary.\n6. If we reach this step, it means there is no path from Wim to Prem.\n\nNow let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from Wim to Prem:\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Prem"
