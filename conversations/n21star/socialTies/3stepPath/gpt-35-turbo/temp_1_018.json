Start with Wim as the initial node.\n2. Enqueue Wim into a queue.\n3. Initialize an empty list to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Add the dequeued scholar to the visited list.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Prem. If it is, stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the dequeued scholar that have not been visited yet.\n5. If Prem is not found, it means there is no path from Wim to Prem.\n\nNow, let's follow the steps and find the shortest path from Wim to Prem.\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Initialize visited = [Wim].\n4. Dequeue Wim -> Visited = [Wim].\n   - Enqueue Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza.\n5. Dequeue Jing -> Visited = [Wim, Jing].\n   - Enqueue Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim.\n6. Dequeue Raj -> Visited = [Wim, Jing, Raj].\n   - Enqueue Wei, Reza, Wim.\n7. Dequeue Wei -> Visited = [Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei].\n   - Enqueue Reza, Wim.\n8. Dequeue Reza -> Visited = [Wim, Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza].\n   - Enqueue Wim.\n9. Dequeue Wim -> Prem is found!\n   - Final path: Wim, Reza, Wim, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Reza, Wim, Prem"
