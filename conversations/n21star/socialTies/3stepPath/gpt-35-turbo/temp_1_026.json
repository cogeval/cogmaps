Check if Raj is connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is just Raj, Gia.\n3. If not, check Raj's connections (Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim).\n4. Check if any of Raj's connections are connected to Gia. If yes, the shortest path is Raj, the connecting scholar, Gia.\n5. If not, move to the next level by checking the connections of Raj's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until Gia is found or all scholars have been checked.\n\nBased on the connections provided, the shortest path from Raj to Gia is:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Wei, Gia"
