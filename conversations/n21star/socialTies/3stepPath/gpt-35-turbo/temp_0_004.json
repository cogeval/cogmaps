Check if Amir is connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is just \"Amir, Sara\".\n3. If not, check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n4. Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to Sara directly. If yes, the shortest path is \"Amir, [connection], Sara\".\n5. If not, check the connections of Amir's connections, and repeat step 4 until Sara is found.\n6. If there are no more connections to check and Sara is still not found, there is no path from Amir to Sara.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Amir is not directly connected to Sara.\n2. Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing.\n4. Jing is not connected to Sara.\n5. Raj is connected to Jing.\n6. Jing is not connected to Sara.\n7. Raj is not connected to Sara.\n8. Wei is connected to Reza.\n9. Reza is not connected to Sara.\n10. Wei is not connected to Sara.\n11. Nisha is connected to Reza.\n12. Reza is not connected to Sara.\n13. Nisha is not connected to Sara.\n14. Reza is not connected to Sara.\n\nSince there are no more connections to check and Sara is not found, there is no path from Amir to Sara.\n\nAnswer: There is no path from Amir to Sara."
