Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set and add Wim to it.\n4. Create an empty path list and add Wim to it.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Ian, we have found the shortest path. Return the path list.\n   - Otherwise, for each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set:\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the path list.\n6. If the queue becomes empty and Ian is not found, there is no path from Wim to Ian.\n\nApplying these steps to the given information, we start with Wim and follow the connections:\n\n1. Start: Wim\n2. Enqueue: Wim\n3. Visited: Wim\n4. Path: Wim\n5. Dequeue: Wim\n   - Connected scholars: Jing, Reza, Wei, Raj\n   - Enqueue: Jing, Reza, Wei, Raj\n   - Visited: Wim, Jing, Reza, Wei, Raj\n   - Path: Wim, Jing, Reza, Wei, Raj\n6.
