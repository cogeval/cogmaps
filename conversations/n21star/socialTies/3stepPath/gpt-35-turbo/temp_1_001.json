We will start with Amir and explore each scholar connected to Amir, then continue exploring their connections until we reach Ian.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir.\n2. Explore Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Explore each connection's connections, while keeping track of the path:\n   - For Wim: Wim is connected to Jing and Wei.\n   - For Raj: Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - For Jing: Jing is connected to Reza and Wim.\n   - For Wei: Wei is connected to Reza and Eva.\n   - For Nisha: Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - For Reza: Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n4. Continue exploring connections until Ian is reached:\n   - For Eva: Eva is connected to Wei.\n   - For Matt: Matt is connected to Eva.\n   - For Amy: Amy is connected to Matt.\n   - For Pari: Pari is connected to Kim, Ian, and Puja.\n   - For Gia: Gia is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, and Prem.\n   - For Ming: Ming is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n   - For Prem: Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n   - For Kim: Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n   - For Puja: Puja is connected to Kim, Ian, and Pari.\n   - For Ian: Ian is the target scholar.\n\nBased on the above steps, the shortest path from Amir to Ian is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Reza, Kim, Ian"
