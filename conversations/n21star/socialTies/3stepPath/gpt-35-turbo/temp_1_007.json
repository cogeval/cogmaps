Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n3. Among Amir's connections, check if any of them are Ming. If so, the shortest path is just Amir and Ming.\n4. If Ming is not found among Amir's connections, move on to the next level of connections. This includes Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n5. Among the second level connections, check if any of them are Ming. If so, the shortest path is Amir, followed by the scholar who directly connects to Ming.\n6. If Ming is not found among the second level connections, move on to the third level of connections. Repeat the process until Ming is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Amir to Ming: Answer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Ming"
