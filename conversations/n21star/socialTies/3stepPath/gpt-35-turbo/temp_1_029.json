None of them are directly connected to Zack. \n\nNow, we need to check the connections of Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim to see if any of them are connected to Zack. \n\nJing is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Kim. Kim is not directly connected to Zack. \n\nWei is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt.
