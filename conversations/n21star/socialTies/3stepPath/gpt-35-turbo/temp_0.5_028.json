Create a queue and enqueue Raj.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued scholar is Prem. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - If not, enqueue all the unvisited scholars connected to the dequeued scholar and mark them as visited.\n4. If we have not found Prem after visiting all the scholars, there is no path from Raj to Prem.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps and find the shortest path from Raj to Prem:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Prem"
