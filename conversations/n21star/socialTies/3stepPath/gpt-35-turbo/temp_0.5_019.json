Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. Create an empty path list to store the shortest path.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n    - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n    - If the scholar is Zack, we have found the shortest path. Append the scholar to the path list and break the loop.\n    - If the scholar has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue all its connected scholars.\n6. If a path to Zack is found, backtrack from Zack to Wim using the connections and append each scholar to the path list.\n7. Reverse the path list to get the shortest path from Wim to Zack.\n8. Return the path list as the final outcome.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Wei, Eva, Amy, Zack"
