Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. From Amir what is the shortest path to Puja?

To get to Puja in the shortest path possible, we should find someone from this group who has a direct or indirect connection with Puja. \n\nChecking the connections, Nisha is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Reza, but not Puja. Similarly, none of Amir's other immediate connections (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza) have a direct connection with Puja.\n\nLet's move to the second degree of connections. We know that Sara is connected to Puja. So, if we can find a link from Amir's connections to Sara, we have the shortest path. Sara has connections to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Checking the connections for Amir's group again, we find that Raj has a connection with Jing who has a connection with Pam, and Pam is directly connected to Puja. So, the shortest path from Amir to Puja would be through Raj, Jing, Pam to Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Jing, Pam, Puja."
