None of these scholars are directly connected to Kim, so we need to look at the second degree connections.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing, but Jing is not connected to Kim.\n4. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n5. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Wim, and Raj, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n6. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n7. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n8. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n9. Therefore, there are no second degree connections from Amir to Kim.\n10. We need to look at the third degree connections.\n11. From the second degree connections, Eva is connected to Amy, Gia, Matt, and Prem, but none of them are connected to Kim.\n12. However, Puja is connected to Pari, and Pari is connected to Amy, and Amy is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Wei, and Wei is directly connected to Amir.\n13. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to Kim is through Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, and Puja.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Amy, Pari, Puja, Kim"
