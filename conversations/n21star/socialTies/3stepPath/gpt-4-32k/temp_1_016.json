Wim is directly connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Jing. \n\nSecond, we will go through each of Wim's connections and identify their connections. \n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n- Jing is connected to Raj, Wei, Reza, Wim, and Pam.\n\nThird, we note that none of Wim's immediate connections or their connections leads to Gia directly. But Jing is connected to Pam, and Pam is connected to Kim. \n\nFinally, Kim is not directly connected to Gia, but she is connected to Ian. We found that Ian isn't connected to Gia either, but he's connected to Puja. \n\nPuja doesn't have a direct connection with Gia, but she is connected to Pari. Finally, Pari is connected to Amy, and Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Gia. So, we have found our shortest path.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Gia."
