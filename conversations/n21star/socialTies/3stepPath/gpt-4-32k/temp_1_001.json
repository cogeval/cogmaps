Jing is not given any connections, but Jing is connected to Pam. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nAmong these, Pam is directly connected to Ian. \n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Ian would therefore be: Amir -> Jing -> Pam -> Ian.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Jing, Pam, Ian."
