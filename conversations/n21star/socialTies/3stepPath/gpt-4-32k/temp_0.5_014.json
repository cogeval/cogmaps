It seems like a network where each scholar is a node and the connections between them are edges. \n\nStarting from Wim, I need to find the shortest path to Sara. \n\nLooking at the connections, Wim is directly connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Jing. \n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. \n\nSara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n\nSo, to reach Sara from Wim, I need to find a scholar who is connected to both Wim and Sara. \n\nChecking the connections, I see that Wim is connected to Amir and Amir is connected to Nisha, and Nisha is connected to Reza, and Reza is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Zack, and Zack is finally connected to Sara.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Sara is: Wim, Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Sara."
