They are Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: None of these scholars is directly connected to Sara. Therefore, we need to look at the scholars they are connected to.\n\nStep 3: Wim is connected to Jing. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is not connected to any other scholars. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nStep 4: None of these connections lead to Sara. Therefore, we need to look at the next level of connections.\n\nStep 5: Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is not connected to any other scholars. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing. \n\nStep 6: Again, none of these connections lead to Sara. Therefore, we need to continue to the next level of connections. \n\nStep 7: From the connections of Raj, Wei, Nisha, Reza, and Wim, we find that Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n\nStep 8: Sara is directly connected to Pam. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Sara is Amir, Raj, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Pam, Sara."
