According to the information provided, Wim is directly connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Jing. \n\nNext, looking at the scholars connected to Wim, none of them is directly connected to Zack. Therefore, I will look at the scholars connected to those scholars connected to Wim. \n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Jing is connected to Wim and Pam. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nAgain, none of these scholars are directly connected to Zack. However, Jing is connected to Pam.\n\nPam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. None of these scholars are directly connected to Zack. However, Pam is connected to Kim and Moin.\n\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. None of these scholars are directly connected to Zack. However, Moin is connected to Pari. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n\nPari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is directly connected to Zack. \n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Zack is therefore: Wim -> Jing -> Pam -> Moin -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Zack\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Moin, Pari, Amy, Matt, Zack."
