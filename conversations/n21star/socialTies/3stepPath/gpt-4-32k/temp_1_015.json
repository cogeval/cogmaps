From the information given, Wim is connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Jing. \n\nNext, I'll check which of these scholars are connected to Matt. None of the scholars directly connected to Wim are connected to Matt.\n\nTherefore, I will have to go a step further. I'll check the scholars that each scholar connected to Wim is connected to. \nAmir does not have any connections to Matt.\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei but none of them is directly connected to Matt.\nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. None of them is directly connected to Matt.\nReza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of them is directly connected to Matt.\nJing is connected to Amir, Wim, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Pam. Among them, Pam is the only scholar who has a new connection which we haven't explored yet.\n\nTherefore, I'll explore the connections of Pam next. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. None of them is directly connected to Matt.\n\nTherefore, I'll go a step further and check the connections of Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \nKim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari.\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\nPuja is connected to Pari.\n\nAmong all the new connections, Pari is directly connected to Amy.\n\nFinally, I'll check Amy's connections. Amy is directly connected to Matt.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Matt is Wim - Jing - Pam - Kim - Pari - Amy - Matt.\n \nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Kim, Pari, Amy, Matt."
