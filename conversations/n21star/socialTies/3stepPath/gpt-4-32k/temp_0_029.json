Let's look at the connections of Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. \n\nJing is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Wei, and Pam. \nWei is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Jing, and Eva. \nReza is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Wei, and Wim. \nWim is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza, and Jing. \n\nAgain, none of these scholars are directly connected to Zack. \n\nLet's go one step further and look at the connections of Eva (from Wei's connections). Eva is connected to Zack, Ming, Gia, Prem, and Matt. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Zack is: Raj -> Wei -> Eva -> Zack. \n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Eva, Zack."
