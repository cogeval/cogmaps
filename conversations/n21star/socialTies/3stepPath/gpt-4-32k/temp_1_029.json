Pam is directly connected to: Sara\n4. Sara doesn't have a direct connection to Zack, but it connects to Kim.\n5. Kim doesn't connect to Zack either, but from the description, Kim is connected to Ian.\n6. Ian doesn't connect directly to Zack, but Ian has a connection to Puja. \n7. Puja is only connected to Pari.\n8. Pari doesn't connect to Zack but it has a connection to Amy.\n9. Amy is connected to Matt.\n10. Finally, Matt connects to Zack.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Zack would be: Raj -> Jing -> Pam -> Sara -> Kim -> Ian -> Puja -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Zack\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Pam, Sara, Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Zack"
