I will continue this process until I've identified the path to Ming.\n\nStep 1: From the given information, Raj is directly connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Therefore, those are the scholars I can move to in the first step.\n\nStep 2: Looking at the connections of Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing is connected to Wim, Wei, and Nisha. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is only connected to Jing. \n\nFrom those lists, the scholar Eva connected to Wei appears as a fresh connection not previously listed in the first step, so that's a possible path.\n\nStep 3: Looking at Eva's connections, she is connected to Matt, Gia, and Amy. Gia seems interesting since she is connected to Ming.\n\nStep 4: Finally, Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. The end destination Ming is a direct connection from Gia.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Raj to Ming is Raj - Wei - Eva - Gia - Ming.\n\nTherefore the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wei, Eva, Gia, Ming"
