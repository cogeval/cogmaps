Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nPam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nKim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nPuja is connected to Pari. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. None of these connections leads to Amir.\n\nSince none of the scholars who are connected with Sara have a connection to Amir, there does not appear to be a path from Amir to Sara within the given network.\n\nAnswer: No path found."
