Jing is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Nisha, Reza, and Pam.\n2. Wei is directly connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n3. Reza is directly connected to Wim, Jing, and Nisha.\n4. Wim is directly connected to Jing.\n\nOut of these, Jing and Reza are the only scholars that are connected to a scholar who is also connected to Puja. Specifically, Jing is connected to Pam who is directly connected to Puja, and Reza is connected to Nisha who is also directly connected to Puja. \n\nComparing these two paths, the shortest path from Raj to Puja would be via Jing and then Pam. \n\nThus, the shortest path to Puja starting from Raj is: Raj, Jing, Pam, Puja.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Jing, Pam, Puja."
