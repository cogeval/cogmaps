Since I need to find the shortest path, I examine the scholars Amir is connected with.\nStep 3: I see that Amir is directly connected to Raj. On the other hand, Raj is connected to Wei, and Wei is connected to Eva. This makes the path - Amir, Raj, Wei, Eva.\nStep 4: I also note that Eva is directly connected to Prem, which completes the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\nTherefore, the shortest path of scholars from Amir to Prem is Amir, Raj, Wei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Raj, Wei, Eva, Prem"
