Wim is connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Jing. \n\nNext, I will check the connections of these scholars to see if any of them are directly connected to Zack. None of them are directly connected to Zack.\n\nThen, I will check the second level of connections. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Jing is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza, and Pam. \n\nAmong these, Pam is the only new connection. Checking Pam's connections, she is connected to Sara, Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n\nChecking the connections of these scholars, Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. \n\nAmong these, Pari is the only new connection. Checking Pari's connections, she is connected to Sara, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja, and Amy. \n\nChecking Amy's connections, she is connected to Zack, Matt, Eva, Gia, Ming, and Prem. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Wim to Zack is: Wim, Jing, Pam, Sara, Pari, Amy, Zack.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam, Sara, Pari, Amy, Zack."
