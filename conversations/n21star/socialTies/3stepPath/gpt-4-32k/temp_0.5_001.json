So we have to find a scholar who is connected to Ian through a second degree connection. \n\nAmong Amir's connections, Nisha is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Reza, but none of these scholars are connected to Ian. \n\nHowever, Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Among these, Eva is connected to Matt, Amy, Gia, and Prem. Among these, Matt is connected to Eva, which doesn't help us reach Ian. \n\nOn the other hand, Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.

Among these, Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to Ian is: Amir - Wei - Reza - Jing - Pam - Ian. \n\nSo, the scholars in order from Amir to Ian are: Amir, Wei, Reza, Jing, Pam, Ian. \n\n"
