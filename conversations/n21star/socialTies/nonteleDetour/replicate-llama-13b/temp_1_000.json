Please be very attentive, the correct output needs your carefulness of the task provided\nFrom the question. scholars who are connected to Prem are also Matt, Eva Amy, which shortened Amir's connection path. To reach them from Ahm he has to connect to only schollars like: Prem, mAt/Matt to get a shortened list; from Moin's connectivity, Amy helps.  AMIr can't directly connects, with ReZa. Therefore he has to  connect to one of Moi's scholars i-E an: Pam scholars have short distance via jING, Rezea connect, or jIA can give another route. If PuJa reject Amir connection with Moin connection short and fast he won't connect, to her but Pam. Moin is connected via puJo only connectors jInG wiAn anNiAn PuJa  or one who reject ReA jIan An Amy and Prem are connected to MaTty PuJA or PJaN is in the path; hence Rej has no shortcut.
