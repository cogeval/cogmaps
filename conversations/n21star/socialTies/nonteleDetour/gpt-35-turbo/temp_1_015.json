So far, we know that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books. We will start with Amir and explore all the connected scholars in a breadth-first manner, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has. \n\nThe possible paths from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books are as follows: \n\n1. Amir, Wim, Jing, Prem \n2. Amir, Wim, Jing, Matt, Eva, Amy, Prem \n\nTo determine the shortest path, we count the number of scholars in each path.
