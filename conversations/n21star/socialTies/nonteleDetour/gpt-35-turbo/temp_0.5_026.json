Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Jing is connected to Wei.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza and Eva.\n5. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n6. Eva is connected to Matt.\n7. Matt is connected to Amy.\n8. Amy is connected to Pari.\n9. Pari is connected to Amy.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of books each scholar is connected to:\n\n- Amir: 0 books\n- Wim: 0 books\n- Raj: 0 books\n- Jing: 0 books\n- Wei: 0 books\n- Nisha: 0 books\n- Reza: 0 books\n- Eva: 0 books\n- Matt: 1 book\n- Amy: 1 book\n- Pari: 1 book\n\nBased on the calculations, the scholar with the maximum number of books is a tie between Matt, Amy, and Pari, each having 1 book. Since we need to find the shortest path, we will choose Matt as the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Matt) is:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, Eva, Matt"
