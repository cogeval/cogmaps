Initialize a queue and visited set.\n2. Enqueue Amir and mark him as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   1. Dequeue the front scholar from the queue.\n   2. If the scholar has the maximum number of books, we stop and return the path.\n   3. Otherwise, enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar who are not visited yet.\n   4.
