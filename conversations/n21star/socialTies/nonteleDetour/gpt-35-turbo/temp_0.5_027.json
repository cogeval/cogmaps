We will start from Amir and explore the connections of each scholar, keeping track of the number of books each scholar has donated. We will continue this process until we reach the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Amir and initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Amir into the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited scholars.\n4. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of books and set it to 0.\n5. Initialize a variable to store the name of the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited:\n     - Add the scholar to the visited set.\n     - Check if the scholar has donated more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the name of the scholar.\n     - Enqueue all the connected scholars of the current scholar into the queue.\n7. Once the queue is empty, we have found the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nNow, let's go through this process step by step:\n\n1. Initialize the queue: [Amir]\n2. Initialize the visited set: {}\n3. Initialize the maximum number of books: 0\n4. Initialize the name of the scholar with the maximum number of books: None\n\nStep 1: Dequeue Amir from the queue.\n   - Add Amir to the visited set: {Amir}\n   - Check if Amir has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Amir into the queue: [Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza]\n\nStep 2: Dequeue Wim from the queue.\n   - Add Wim to the visited set: {Amir, Wim}\n   - Check if Wim has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Wim into the queue: [Jing]\n\nStep 3: Dequeue Raj from the queue.\n   - Add Raj to the visited set: {Amir, Wim, Raj}\n   - Check if Raj has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Raj into the queue: [Jing, Wei, Reza]\n\nStep 4: Dequeue Jing from the queue.\n   - Add Jing to the visited set: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing}\n   - Check if Jing has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Jing into the queue: [Wei]\n\nStep 5: Dequeue Wei from the queue.\n   - Add Wei to the visited set: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei}\n   - Check if Wei has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Wei into the queue: [Reza]\n\nStep 6: Dequeue Nisha from the queue.\n   - Add Nisha to the visited set: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha}\n   - Check if Nisha has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Nisha into the queue: [Reza]\n\nStep 7: Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n   - Add Reza to the visited set: {Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza}\n   - Check if Reza has donated more books than the current maximum (0). No.\n   - Enqueue the connected scholars of Reza into the queue: [Wim, Jing]\n\nStep 8: Dequeue Jing from the queue.\n   - Jing has already been visited, so skip.\n\nStep 9: Dequeue Wim from the queue.\n   - Wim has already been visited, so skip.\n\nStep 10: The queue is empty. We have finished exploring all the scholars.\n\nThe scholar with the maximum number of books is Prem, who has donated 50 books. The shortest path from Amir to Prem is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Reza, Prem"
