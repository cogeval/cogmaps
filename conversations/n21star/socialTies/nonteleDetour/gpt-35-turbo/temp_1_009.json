Then, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nFirst, let's organize the given connections and donation information:\n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\nSara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\nZack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\nPam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\nMoin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\nMing is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\nWei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\nKim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\nIan is connected to Puja and Pari.\nGia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\nReza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\nPuja is connected to scholar Pari.\nPrem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\nWim is connected to Jing.\nPari is connected to Amy.\nAmy is connected to Matt.\nMatt is connected to Eva.\n\nNow, let's assign the number of books donated by each scholar:\nPrem - 50 books\nMoin - 10 books\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books. We will start by creating a queue and adding Amir to it. We will also create a visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n\nThe algorithm steps are as follows:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and add Amir to the queue.\n2. Create an empty visited set.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has the maximum number of books. If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, add the scholar to the visited set.\n   - Get all the neighbors of the scholar who have not been visited.\n   - For each neighbor, add them to the queue and update their path by appending the current scholar.\n4. If no path is found, return an empty path.\n\nLet's follow the algorithm step by step:\n\nAnswer: Amir"
