Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Then we can identify the scholar with the maximum number of books and form the shortest path from Amir to that scholar.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. We do not have information about their book donations yet.\n\nBased on the given information, we need to gather the book donation details for each scholar. Let's follow the connections and update the information:\n\n3. Wim is connected to Jing.\n4. Raj is connected to Jing.\n5. Jing is connected to Wei.\n6. Wei is connected to Reza and Eva.\n7. Nisha is connected to Reza and Wim.\n8. Reza is connected to Jing.\n9. Eva is connected to Matt and Amy.\n10. Amy is connected to Matt.\n11. Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of books donated:\n\n- Prem is donating 50 books.\n- Moin is donating 10 books.\n\nThe maximum number of books donated is 50 by Prem.\n\nFinally, we need to identify the shortest path from Amir to Prem:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim.\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Jing is connected to Wei.\n- Wei is connected to Eva.\n- Eva is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"
