We will continue this process until we reach a scholar who has the maximum number of books.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a dictionary to store the number of books each scholar has.\n2. Add Amir to the queue and set his book count to 0.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the scholar has more books than the current maximum book count. If so, update the maximum book count and store the scholar's name.\n   - Explore the connections of the current scholar. If a connection has not been visited before, enqueue the connection and update its book count by adding the current scholar's book count plus the number of books they are donating.\n4.
