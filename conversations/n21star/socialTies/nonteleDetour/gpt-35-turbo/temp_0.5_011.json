Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n3. Initialize variables for the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n4. Start a loop until the queue is empty.\n5. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n6. Check if the current scholar has donated more books than the current maximum. If so, update the maximum number of books and the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n7.
