Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n3. Move to the next layer of connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n4. Check the connections of these scholars and keep track of the number of books they have donated.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until we reach Prem.\n6. Choose the scholar with the maximum number of books and update the current path.\n7.
