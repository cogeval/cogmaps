Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Prem is donating the maximum number of books (50). However, there is no direct connection between Amir and Prem.\n\nWe can take the following steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim.\n2. Wim is connected to Jing.\n3. Since Jing is not directly connected to Prem, we need to explore other connections.\n4. Raj is connected to Jing, and Jing is connected to Prem.\n5. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is: Amir, Wim, Jing, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Jing, Prem."
