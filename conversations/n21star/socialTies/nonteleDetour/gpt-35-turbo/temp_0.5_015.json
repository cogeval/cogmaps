We will start by creating a graph representation of the connections between the scholars and their book donations.\n\nFirst, let's create a dictionary to represent the connections between scholars:\n\nConnections = {\n    'Amir': ['Wim', 'Raj', 'Jing', 'Wei', 'Nisha', 'Reza'],\n    'Sara': ['Pari', 'Pam', 'Kim', 'Ian', 'Moin', 'Puja'],\n    'Zack': ['Matt', 'Eva', 'Amy', 'Gia', 'Ming', 'Prem'],\n    'Nisha': ['Reza', 'Wim', 'Raj', 'Jing', 'Wei'],\n    'Raj': ['Jing', 'Wei', 'Reza', 'Wim'],\n    'Pam': ['Jing', 'Kim', 'Ian', 'Moin', 'Puja'],\n    'Moin': ['Puja', 'Pari', 'Kim', 'Ian'],\n    'Ming': ['Prem', 'Matt', 'Eva', 'Amy', 'Gia'],\n    'Wei': ['Reza', 'Wim', 'Eva'],\n    'Kim': ['Ian', 'Puja', 'Pari'],\n    'Ian': ['Puja', 'Pari'],\n    'Gia': ['Prem', 'Matt', 'Eva', 'Amy'],\n    'Reza': ['Wim', 'Jing'],\n    'Puja': ['Pari'],\n    'Prem': ['Matt', 'Eva', 'Amy'],\n    'Wim': ['Jing'],\n    'Pari': ['Amy'],\n    'Amy': ['Matt'],\n    'Matt': ['Eva']\n}\n\nNext, let's create a dictionary to represent the number of books donated by each scholar:\n\nBooks = {\n    'Prem': 50,\n    'Moin': 10\n}\n\nWe can now implement the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\n1. Start by initializing a queue and a visited set. Add Amir to the queue and mark him as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n3. Check if the dequeued scholar has donated books. If yes, store the scholar's name and break the loop.\n4. If the scholar has not donated books, add all their connected scholars to the queue if they have not been visited before. Mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty.\n6. Print the stored scholar names in the order they were visited, separated by commas.\n\nNow let's implement this algorithm:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(start, connections, books):\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n    queue.append(start)\n    visited.add(start)\n    max_books_scholar = None\n    \n    while queue:\n        scholar = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if scholar in books:\n            max_books_scholar = scholar\n            break\n        \n        for connected_scholar in connections[scholar]:\n            if connected_scholar not in visited:\n                queue.append(connected_scholar)\n                visited.add(connected_scholar)\n    \n    path = [start]\n    current_scholar = start\n    \n    while current_scholar != max_books_scholar:\n        for connected_scholar in connections[current_scholar]:\n            if connected_scholar in visited:\n                path.append(connected_scholar)\n                current_scholar = connected_scholar\n                break\n    \n    return ', '.join(path)\n\nNow we can find the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books:\n\nstart = 'Amir'\nshortest_path = find_shortest_path(start, Connections, Books)\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Reza, Wim, Eva"
