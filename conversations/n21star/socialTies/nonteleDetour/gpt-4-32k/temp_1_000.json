Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Therefore, Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nThen we have to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem. Looking at the connections, it appears the shortest path is:\n\nAmir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. Amir is connected with Wei.\n2. Wei is connected with Eva.\n3. Eva is connected with Prem.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."
