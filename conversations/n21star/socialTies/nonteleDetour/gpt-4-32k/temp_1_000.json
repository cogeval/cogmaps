Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Pam -> Moin\n\nPath to Prem (donating 50 books):\n1. Amir -> Wei\n2. Wei -> Eva\n3. Eva -> Prem\n\nSince we want the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books, we will choose the path to Prem, who is donating 50 books.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
