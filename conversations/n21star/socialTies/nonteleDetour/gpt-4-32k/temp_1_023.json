Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

However, none of these scholars have the maximum number of books.\n\nLooking at the connections further:\n- Wim is connected to Jing, but neither has the books.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but neither has the books.\n- Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, and Wim, but none of them has the books.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, but Eva doesn't have the books.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, but none of them has the books.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing, but neither has the books.\n\nTherefore, Amir doesn't have a direct connection to either Moin or Prem. \n\nHowever, Sara, who is directly connected to Moin (the person with 10 books), is also connected to Kim and Puja. Puja is connected to Pari, and Pari is connected to Amy. Amy, in turn, is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Prem (the person with 50 books, which is the maximum number of books).\n\nThus, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is through Amir - Sara - Kim - Puja - Pari - Amy - Matt - Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Sara, Kim, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Prem"
