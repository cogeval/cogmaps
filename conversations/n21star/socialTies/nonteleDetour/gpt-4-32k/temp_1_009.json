Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Prem has 50, and Moin has 10, so Prem is the person we want to reach.\n\nNext, I will analyze the connections among scholars. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nAmong these, only Wei is directly connected to someone who is connected to Prem (Wei - Eva - Prem). So, the shortest path would be Amir - Wei - Eva - Prem.\n\nThe scholar names in order from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books are Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem. \n\nLet's provide the final answer as a sequence of names separated by commas."

Matt is also directly connected to Prem.\n\nSo, the new shortest path from Amir to Prem (the person with the maximum number of books) is: Amir - Nisha - Matt - Prem. \n\nI'll put these names into the required format: Answer: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem."
