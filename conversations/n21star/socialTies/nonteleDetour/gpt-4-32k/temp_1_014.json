Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to Prem.\n- Wim: Connected to Jing.\n- Raj: Connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Jing: Not specified.\n- Wei: Connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Nisha: Connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Reza: Connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nNone of them are connected to Prem.\n\nStep 3: Move to the next level of connections. Let's focus on Wei because Wei is connected to Eva, and Eva is directly connected to Prem.\n- Eva: Connected to Prem, Matt, Amy, and Gia.\n\nSo the shortest path to Prem from Amir is through Wei and Eva.\n\nTherefore, the names in order from Amir to Prem are: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem. \n\nNote: Remember to only take books from Prem, as stated in the task."

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nStep 2: Check if any of Amir's connections are connected to Prem directly or indirectly.\n- Wim: Connected to Jing.\n- Raj: Connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Jing: Not specified.\n- Wei: Connected to Reza, Wim.\n- Nisha: Connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Matt.\n- Reza: Connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nHere, Nisha is connected to Matt.\n\nStep 3: Check Matt's connections. Matt is connected to Eva and Prem. Since Prem is the one who donates the maximum number of books, this is our end point.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering the new connections, is through Nisha and Matt.\n\nTherefore, the names in order from Amir to Prem are: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem. \n\nNote: Remember to only take books from Prem, as stated in the task.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem"
