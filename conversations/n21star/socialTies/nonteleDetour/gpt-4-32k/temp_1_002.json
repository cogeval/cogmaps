Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Zack is connected to Prem.\n\nNow let's search through these connections to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem:\n\n1.
