Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

Prem has the maximum number of books.\n\nSecondly, we have to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\nStarting from Amir, let's see who Amir is connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\nFrom those, we can see if any of them is connected to Prem: \n\n1. Wim is connected to Jing.\n2. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n3. Jing is not connected to Prem.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n6. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n\nIt seems none of them is directly connected to Prem. But Wei is connected to Eva and Eva is connected to Prem. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir to the scholar with the maximum number of books is: Amir -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem. \n\nThe scholars names in order, including Amir, are Amir, Wei, Eva, and Prem. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem."
