Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

I can do this by creating a mental map with Amir as the starting point and Prem (the person with the maximum number of books) as the endpoint.\n\nThe connections are as follows:\n\n1. Amir is connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are connected to other scholars but none of them are directly connected to Prem.\n\nTo find the shortest path, I will need to explore the connections of the scholars who are connected to Amir. Based on the information given, I can see that Nisha is connected to Wim and Wei (among others). And Wei is connected to Eva. And Eva is connected to Prem.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir (the starting point) to Prem (the endpoint) is: Amir -> Nisha -> Wei -> Eva -> Prem.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is through Nisha, Wei, Eva, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Wei, Eva, Prem."

Matt is directly connected to Prem, the person with the maximum number of books.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Amir (the starting point) to Prem (the endpoint) is: Amir -> Nisha -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nSo the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books is through Nisha, Matt, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem."
