Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

This makes Prem the person with the maximum number of books.\n\n2. The task is to find the shortest path from Amir to Prem.\n\n3. Looking at the connections, Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n\n4. From these scholars, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and Reza are connected to other scholars, but none of them are directly connected to Prem.\n\n5. However, Wei is connected to Eva, who is connected to Prem. \n\n6. Therefore, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is through Wei and Eva.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Prem"
