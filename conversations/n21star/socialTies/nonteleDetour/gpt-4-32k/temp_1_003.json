Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

From the details provided, Prem has 50 books and Moin has 10. So, the person with the maximum books is Prem.\n\nNow I'll map out the connections, starting from Amir:\n\n1. Amir is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. So, if Prem is in this list, then the shortest path would be Amir to Prem directly. But Prem is not here, so I'll need to look for connections from these people to Prem.\n\n2. From the connections provided, Zack is the one who is directly connected to Prem. Now I need to find the shortest path from Amir to Zack.\n\n3. Amir is not directly connected to Zack. So, I need to find a link between Amir's connections and Zack. Reviewing the information provided, I see that Wei is connected to Eva, and Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Zack.\n\n4. So, the shortest path from Amir to Zack (and then to Prem) is via Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, and finally, Prem.\n\nAfter compiling this information, I can provide the path:\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wei, Eva, Matt, Zack, Prem"

Amir is directly connected to Nisha.\n\n2. Nisha is directly connected to Matt.\n\n3. Matt is directly connected to Zack.\n\n4.
