Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books?

The shortest path is determined by the connection between the scholars. To do this, I'll check the scholars directly connected to Amir first. If Prem isn't directly connected, then I'll look for the scholars connected to Amir's connections. I will continue this process until Prem is found. \n\n1. Start from Amir, who is directly connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Since none of Amir's direct connections are to Prem, let's check Amir's secondary connections.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Jing is only mentioned as connected to other scholars, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, and Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n4. At this level also, no connection with Prem is found.\n5. The next level is to find out who is connected to Wim, Jing, Wei, Raj, Reza, and Nisha.\n6. At this level, we notice that Wei is connected to Eva. And from Eva we can reach to Prem, who is the scholar with the maximum number of books.\n\nThe shortest path from Amir to Prem, the person with the maximum number of books, is through Wei and Eva."

Start from Amir, who is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Since none of these scholars is Prem, look into their connections.\n3. Wim is connected to Jing, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Jing only has connections mentioned with other scholars, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, and now Matt, Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n4. Wei and Eva are no longer connected, this path to Prem is no longer valid.\n5. Nisha is now connected to Matt, and from Matt, we can reach Prem who is the scholar with the maximum number of books. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Amir to Prem, considering the new connections, is through Nisha and Matt. \n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem\n"
