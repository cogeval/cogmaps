Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. You have been told that Prem is donating 50 books and Moin is donating 10 books. Now, from Amir what is the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books? Remember that you can take books only from one person. Starting from Amir, please list the scholar names in order, including Amir, separated by commas."

None of them are, so move to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Identify the connections of the six people connected to Amir, one by one, and see if any of them are connected to Prem or Moin.\n\n3a. Wim is connected to Jing, and Jing is not Prem or Moin.\n3b. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Jing, Wei, and Reza are not Prem or Moin. Wim is already covered in step 3a.\n3c. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, Wim, and Raj. Wei, Reza, Wim, and Raj are not Prem or Moin, and all of them are already covered.\n3d. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. Reza and Wim are not Prem or Moin, and both are already covered. Eva is not connected to Prem or Moin.\n3e. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. All of these are already covered and none are Prem or Moin.\n3f. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Both are already covered and none are Prem or Moin.\n\nStep 4: Identify the connections of all people connected to the above-mentioned scholars. Continue this step until Prem or Moin are found.\n\nUpon doing so, I found that Prem is connected to Matt and Matt is connected to Zack. And Zack is connected to Amir.\n\nStep 5: Considering that Prem has a larger number of books than Moin, the shortest path to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) from Amir is Amir -> Zack -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Zack, Matt, Prem"

Wim is linked to Jing, but Jing is not Prem or Moin.\n3b. Raj is linked to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. None of them are Prem or Moin, and Wim has been addressed in 3a.\n3c. Jing is linked to Wei, Reza, Wim, and Raj. None of these are Prem or Moin, and all have been checked.\n3d. Wei is no longer connected to Eva due to their disagreement. So, he is connected to Reza, Wim, none of whom are Prem or Moin.\n3e. Nisha is now connected to Matt, as well as Reza, Wim, Raj, and Jing. Matt is connected to Prem.\n3f. Reza is linked to Wim and Jing. Both are checked and not linked to Prem or Moin.\n\nStep 4: Prem is connected to Matt, and Matt is now connected to Nisha. Nisha is connected to Amir.\n\nSo, after the connections have been modified due to the disagreement between Wei and Eva, and the new connection between Nisha and Matt, the shortest path from Amir to the person with the maximum number of books (Prem) is now Amir -> Nisha -> Matt -> Prem.\n\nAnswer: Amir, Nisha, Matt, Prem"
