Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

This is a cluster of 7 scholars.\n2. **Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem**. This is a cluster of 6 scholars.\n\nI have identified these clusters by looking for groups of scholars who are connected to each other with at least 2 connections. For example, the scholars in the first cluster are all connected to each other in at least 2 ways. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Wim is connected to Raj and Jing. Raj is connected to Jing and Wei. Jing is connected to Wei and Reza. Wei is connected to Reza. Nisha is connected to Reza and Raj. Reza is connected to Jing and Wim. This cluster has 7 scholars and each scholar is connected to at least 2 other scholars in the cluster.\n\nThe other clusters can be identified in a similar way.\n\nHowever, the clusters that include Sara and Zack are not densely connected. Sara is only connected to 5 other scholars, and only 2 of those scholars are connected to each other. Zack is only connected to 5 other scholars, and only 2 of those scholars are connected to each other. Therefore, these clusters do not meet the definition of a densely connected cluster."
