How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group?\n23 is the correct answer\nA densely-connected cluster is a group of any number of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars. Answer: there are 15 densely-connected clusters Answer: there are 21 densely-connected clusters Answer: there are 23 [scholars] densely-connected clusters\nA scheduler for a project scheduling tool must be able to run and restart the project scheduler on any target instance in the cluster.\nWhen the scheduler instance is started, it has to check if all the target clusters are ready to use. If this is the case, the scheduler instance should be terminated and the worker daemon should run at each target. If any of the target cluster instances is not ready to use, you have to wait to ensure that they are ready and once that is done you can start the scheduler again at all the target instances.\nThere is only one type of instance in the cluster and one type of task to assign to the instances.\nAnswer: There is only one type of task and there is more than one type of instance\nThere is more than one type of instance in the cluster and more than one type of task to assign to the instances.\nUser: Imagine a group of 30 sch"
