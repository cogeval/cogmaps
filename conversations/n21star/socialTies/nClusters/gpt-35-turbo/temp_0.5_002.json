Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the clusters by performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each scholar and marking all the connected scholars. We will keep track of the visited scholars to avoid revisiting them.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Create an empty set to store visited scholars.\n2. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of clusters.\n3. For each scholar in the group:\n   a. If the scholar is not in the visited set:\n      i. Increment the counter by 1.\n      ii. Perform a DFS starting from the current scholar, marking all connected scholars as visited.\n4. The final counter value represents the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given group:\n\n1. Initialize visited set as an empty set.\n2. Initialize counter = 0.\n3. For each scholar in the group:\n   a. If the scholar is not in the visited set:\n      i. Increment the counter by 1.\n      ii. Perform a DFS starting from the current scholar, marking all connected scholars as visited.\n\nStarting with Amir:\n- Amir is not in the visited set. Increment counter to 1.\n- Perform DFS starting from Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are connected to Amir. Mark them as visited.\n- Add Amir to the visited set.\n\nMoving on to Sara:\n- Sara is not in the visited set. Increment counter to 2.\n- Perform DFS starting from Sara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja are connected to Sara. Mark them as visited.\n- Add Sara to the visited set.\n\nContinuing with Zack:\n- Zack is not in the visited set. Increment counter to 3.\n- Perform DFS starting from Zack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem are connected to Zack. Mark them as visited.\n- Add Zack to the visited set.\n\nMoving on to Nisha:\n- Nisha is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Raj:\n- Raj is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Pam:\n- Pam is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Moin:\n- Moin is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Ming:\n- Ming is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Wei:\n- Wei is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Kim:\n- Kim is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Ian:\n- Ian is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Gia:\n- Gia is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Reza:\n- Reza is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Puja:\n- Puja is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Prem:\n- Prem is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Wim:\n- Wim is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Pari:\n- Pari is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Amy:\n- Amy is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nContinuing with Matt:\n- Matt is already in the visited set. Skip.\n\nThe DFS traversal is complete.
