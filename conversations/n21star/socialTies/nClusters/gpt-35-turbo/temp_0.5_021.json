We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the connections between scholars:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n- Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n- Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n- Puja is connected to Pari.\n- Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Pari is connected to Amy.\n- Amy is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nNow, let's represent this information in a graph:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected scholar clusters. We can do this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each scholar and counting the number of scholars visited in each DFS traversal.\n\nStarting from each scholar, we perform a DFS and mark each visited scholar. If the number of visited scholars is greater than or equal to 2, we consider it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nLet's perform the DFS traversal:\n\nDFS starting from Amir: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza (7 scholars)\nDFS starting from Sara: Sara, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Gia, Ming, Prem (8 scholars)\nDFS starting from Zack: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Prem, Ming (7 scholars)\nDFS starting from Nisha: Nisha, Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei (6 scholars)\nDFS starting from Raj: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim (5 scholars)\nDFS starting from Pam: Pam, Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja (6 scholars)\nDFS starting from Moin: Moin, Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian (5 scholars)\nDFS starting from Ming: Ming, Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia (6 scholars)\nDFS starting from Wei: Wei, Reza, Wim, Jing (4 scholars)\nDFS starting from Kim: Kim, Ian, Puja, Pari (4 scholars)\nDFS starting from Ian: Ian, Puja, Pari (3 scholars)\nDFS starting from Gia: Gia, Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy (5 scholars)\n\nFrom the above DFS traversals, we can see that there are 3 densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\n1. Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza (7 scholars)\n2. Cluster 2: Sara, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Gia, Ming, Prem (8 scholars)\n3. Cluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Prem, Ming (7 scholars)\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
