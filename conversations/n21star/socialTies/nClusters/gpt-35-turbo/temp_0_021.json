Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a list of all the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei: Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim: Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan: Puja, Pari\nGia: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza: Wim, Jing\nPuja: Pari\nPrem: Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim: Jing\nPari: Amy\nAmy: Matt\nMatt: Eva\n\nNext, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to find the connected components. We will start with each scholar as a separate component and merge components whenever there is a connection between scholars.\n\nUsing DFS, we can start with Amir and explore all the scholars connected to him (Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza). This forms the first cluster.\n\nNext, we move to Sara and explore all the scholars connected to her (Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja). This forms the second cluster.\n\nContinuing this process for all the scholars, we find that there are no more clusters formed. All the scholars are part of either the first or second cluster.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: there are 2 clusters."
