Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We'll iterate through each scholar and create a set for each connection they have. Then, we'll merge the sets whenever two scholars have a common connection. Finally, we'll count the number of unique sets remaining, which represents the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Create an empty dictionary called `clusters` to store the scholar and their corresponding set.\n2. Iterate through each scholar in the list and initialize a set containing only that scholar.\n3. For each connection of the current scholar, check if the connected scholar is already a part of any existing set. If so, merge the two sets together.\n4. If the connected scholar is not part of any existing set, add them as a separate set in the `clusters` dictionary.\n5. After processing all connections for a scholar, update the merged sets in the `clusters` dictionary.\n6. Count the number of unique sets in the `clusters` dictionary.\n7.
