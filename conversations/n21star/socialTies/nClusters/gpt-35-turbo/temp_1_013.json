We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\nFrom the given information, we can identify the following connections between scholars:\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n- Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n- Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n- Puja is connected to Pari.\n- Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Pari is connected to Amy.\n- Amy is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nNow, let's represent this information as a graph and find the connected components.\n\nFrom the given connections, we can form the following connected components:\n- Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza\n- Cluster 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja\n- Cluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem\n\nTherefore, Answer: there are 3 clusters"
