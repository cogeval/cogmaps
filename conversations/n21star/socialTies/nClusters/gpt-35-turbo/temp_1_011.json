Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars mentioned in the text.\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\n2. Next, we need to identify the clusters of scholars that are densely connected. To do this, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and identify the connected components.\n\nDFS Algorithm:\n- Initialize an empty list to store the clusters\n- Initialize a set to keep track of visited scholars\n- For each scholar in the graph:\n  - If the scholar has not been visited:\n    - Initialize an empty list to store the current cluster\n    - Perform a depth-first search starting from the current scholar:\n      - Add the current scholar to the cluster\n      - Mark the scholar as visited\n      - For each connected scholar:\n        - If the connected scholar has not been visited:\n          - Recursively perform the depth-first search from the connected scholar\n\n3. After performing the DFS algorithm, we can count the number of clusters that meet the criteria of being densely connected (having a minimum of 2 scholars).\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
