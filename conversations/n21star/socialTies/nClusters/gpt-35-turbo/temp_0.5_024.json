Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nStep 1: Create an adjacency list representation of the graph based on the given connections:\n- Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Sara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Zack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n- Nisha: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\n- Raj: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n- Pam: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Moin: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\n- Ming: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\n- Wei: Reza, Wim, Eva\n- Kim: Ian, Puja, Pari\n- Ian: Puja, Pari\n- Gia: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\n- Reza: Wim, Jing\n- Puja: Pari\n- Prem: Matt, Eva, Amy\n- Wim: Jing\n- Pari: Amy\n- Amy: Matt\n- Matt: Eva\n- Eva: -\n\nStep 2: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to identify the connected components in the graph. Start with an unvisited scholar and explore all connected scholars to form a cluster. Repeat this process until all scholars are visited.\n\nBased on the given connections, we can identify the following clusters:\n- Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Cluster 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Cluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
