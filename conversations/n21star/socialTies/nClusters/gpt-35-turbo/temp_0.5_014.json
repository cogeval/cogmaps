Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections between scholars based on the given information.\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\n2. Identify the connected components in the graph.\n\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following connected components:\n- Component 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Component 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Component 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n\n3. Count the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n\nFrom the identified connected components, we can see that there are 3 densely-connected scholar clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
