First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between scholars. Each scholar will be a node, and the connections between them will be edges.\n\n2. Next, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to find the connected components in the graph.\n\n3. For each connected component, we can check if it contains at least 2 scholars. If it does, we count it as a densely-connected cluster.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Create a graph representation of the connections:\n\n- Amir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Sara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Zack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n- Nisha: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\n- Raj: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n- Pam: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Moin: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\n- Ming: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\n- Wei: Reza, Wim, Eva\n- Kim: Ian, Puja, Pari\n- Ian: Puja, Pari\n- Gia: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\n- Reza: Wim, Jing\n- Puja: Pari\n- Prem: Matt, Eva, Amy\n- Wim: Jing\n- Pari: Amy\n- Amy: Matt\n- Matt: Eva\n\n2. Use a graph traversal algorithm to find the connected components:\n\nStarting with Amir:\n- Amir -> Wim -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Reza\n- Amir -> Nisha\n\nStarting with Sara:\n- Sara -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Eva -> Ming -> Gia\n- Sara -> Pam -> Jing -> Kim -> Ian -> Moin -> Puja\n\nStarting with Zack:\n- Zack -> Matt -> Eva -> Ming -> Gia -> Prem\n- Zack -> Amy\n\n3. Count the densely-connected clusters:\n\nWe have 3 densely-connected scholar clusters:\n- Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Cluster 2: Sara, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Ming, Gia, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Cluster 3: Zack\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
