Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a list of all the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei: Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim: Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan: Puja, Pari\nGia: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza: Wim, Jing\nPuja: Pari\nPrem: Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim: Jing\nPari: Amy\nAmy: Matt\nMatt: Eva\n\nNext, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all the connected components in the graph. We start with an empty list of clusters and an empty set of visited nodes.\n\nFor each unvisited scholar, we perform a DFS starting from that scholar. During the DFS, we add the visited scholars to the current cluster. Once the DFS is complete, we add the current cluster to the list of clusters.\n\nFinally, we count the number of clusters that have a size of 2 or more.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list of clusters and an empty set of visited nodes.\n2. For each unvisited scholar:\n   a. Start a new cluster.\n   b. Perform a DFS starting from the current scholar:\n      i. If the current scholar has not been visited:\n         - Mark the current scholar as visited.\n         - Add the current scholar to the current cluster.\n         - For each connected scholar:\n           * If the connected scholar has not been visited, perform a DFS starting from the connected scholar.\n   c. If the size of the current cluster is 2 or more, add it to the list of clusters.\n3. Count the number of clusters in the list that have a size of 2 or more.\n4. Output the result.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the answer."
