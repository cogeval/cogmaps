            "content": "To find the densely-connected scholar clusters in this group, we can use the concept of connected components in a graph. We can start by representing the connections between scholars as a graph, where each scholar is a node and the connections between scholars are edges.\n\nWe can then use graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), to find the connected components in the graph. A connected component is a subgraph in which every pair of nodes is connected by a path.\n\nLet's walk through the steps to find the densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\n1. Construct the graph:\n   - Create a node for each scholar.\n   - Create edges between scholars based on their connections.\n\n2. Perform a graph traversal (DFS or BFS):\n   - Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n   - For each unvisited node in the graph:\n     - Start a new connected component and increment the counter.\n     - Use DFS or BFS to explore all the connected scholars in the current component.\n     - Mark visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n     - When the traversal is complete, all scholars in the current component have been visited.\n\n3. Output the number of densely-connected scholar clusters:\n   - Return the final counter value.\n\nLet's execute these steps to find the densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\nAnswer: there are 6 clusters"
