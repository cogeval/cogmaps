First, let's create a graph representation of the connections between the scholars. Each scholar will be a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars will be represented by edges.\n\n2. Based on the given information, we can create the following graph:\n\n   - Amir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n   - Sara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n   - Zack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n   - Nisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\n   - Raj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n   - Pam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n   - Moin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\n   - Ming -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\n   - Wei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\n   - Kim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\n   - Ian -> Puja, Pari\n   - Gia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\n   - Reza -> Wim, Jing\n   - Puja -> Pari\n   - Prem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\n   - Wim -> Jing\n   - Pari -> Amy\n   - Amy -> Matt\n   - Matt -> Eva\n\n3. Now, we can find the number of connected components in this graph. Each connected component represents a densely-connected scholar cluster.\n\n   Answer: there are 6 clusters"
