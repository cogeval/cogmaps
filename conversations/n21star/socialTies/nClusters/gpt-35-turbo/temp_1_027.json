Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Starting with Amir, we can trace his connections to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. From Nisha, we can see her connections to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. We have already counted these connections when considering Amir, so we don't need to count them again.\n3. Similarly, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but these connections have already been counted in the previous steps.\n4. Moving on, we see that Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. We'll note this as a new cluster.\n5. Next, Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. This forms another cluster.\n6. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. This is a new cluster.\n7. Continuing, we see that Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. We've already counted these connections before.\n8. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. We've already counted these connections as well.\n9. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. We have counted these connections too.\n10. Finally, we have Gia, who is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. We have already counted these connections.\n\nAfter analyzing the connections, we can conclude that there are 3 densely-connected scholar clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
