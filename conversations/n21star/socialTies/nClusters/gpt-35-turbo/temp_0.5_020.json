Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph based on the given connections:\n\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n- Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n- Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n- Puja is connected to Pari.\n- Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Pari is connected to Amy.\n- Amy is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\n1. Cluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Cluster 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Cluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
