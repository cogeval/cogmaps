Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza are all connected.\n2. Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja are all connected.\n3. Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem are all connected.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these clusters are connected to each other:\n\n1. The cluster of Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza is not connected to any other cluster.\n2. The cluster of Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja is not connected to any other cluster.\n3. The cluster of Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem is not connected to any other cluster.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of 3 densely-connected scholar clusters in this group.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
