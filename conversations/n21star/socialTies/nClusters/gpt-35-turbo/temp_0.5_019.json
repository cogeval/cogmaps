We mark each visited scholar to avoid revisiting them.\n\nAfter completing the DFS, we move on to the next unvisited scholar and repeat the process until all scholars have been visited.\n\nBy counting the number of DFS iterations, we can determine the number of densely-connected scholar clusters in the group.\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first unvisited scholar, Amir.\n2. Perform a DFS from Amir and mark all visited scholars: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n3. Move on to the next unvisited scholar, Sara.\n4.
