We can start by listing all the connections between the scholars:\n\nAmir: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei: Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim: Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan: Puja, Pari\nGia: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza: Wim, Jing\nPuja: Pari\nPrem: Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim: Jing\nPari: Amy\nAmy: Matt\nMatt: Eva\n\nNext, we can identify the clusters by following the connections. We start with a scholar and trace all the connections to identify the cluster. Once a cluster is identified, we remove those scholars from the list and continue until no more clusters can be found. Here are the clusters we can identify:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nCluster 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nCluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
