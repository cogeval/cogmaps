We can use the concept of the graph, where each person is a node, and the connections are edges. \n\nFirst, we can create a graph based on the information provided. Then we can find all the connected components of the graph, which are the densely-connected clusters we are looking for.\n\nUsing this method, we can find that there are 4 densely-connected clusters in the art office:\n- Cluster 1: Amy, Bob, Cal, Dan, Eva, Fay, and Gus\n- Cluster 2: Ian, Joe, Kim, Leo, Max, Ned, and Ola\n- Cluster 3: Pam, Gia, Tom, and Zac\n- Cluster 4: Kai and Sue\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
