Each scholar will be represented as a node, and the connections between them will be represented as edges. \n\nNext, we can identify the clusters by looking for densely-connected subgraphs. One way to do this is by using the concept of connected components. A connected component is a subgraph where all the nodes are connected to each other, and there are no edges connecting nodes in different components.\n\nUsing this approach, we can identify the following clusters:\n\n- Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza\n- Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, and Moin\n- Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem\n\nAnswer: There are 3 clusters."
