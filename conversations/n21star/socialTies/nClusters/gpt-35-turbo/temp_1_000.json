Perform a graph traversal to identify densely-connected clusters:\n   - Initialize a counter for the number of clusters as 0.\n   - For each scholar in the list of scholars:\n     - If the scholar is not already visited:\n       - Initialize an empty set to store the scholars in the cluster.\n       - Perform a DFS or BFS from the current scholar to explore the cluster.\n       - Increment the counter by 1 since a new cluster has been found.\n\n3. Count the number of densely-connected clusters:\n   - The final outcome is the count of the number of clusters found.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
