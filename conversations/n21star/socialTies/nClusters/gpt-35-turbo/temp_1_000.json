Sue is working with Tom, Zac, Kai, Liv, Pam, and Gia. Fay is working with Gus, Bob, Cal, Dan, and Eva. Cal is working with Dan, Eva, Gus, and Bob. Kim is working with Dan, Leo, Max, Ned, and Ola. Ned is working with Ola, Joe, Leo, and Max. Pam is working with Gia, Tom, Zac, Kai, and Liv. Eva is working with Gus, Bob and Zac. Leo is working with Max, Ola, and Joe. Max is connected to Ola and Joe. Liv is working with Gia, Tom, Zac, and Kai. Gus is working with Bob, and Dan. Ola is working with Joe. Gia is working Tom, Zac, and Kai. Bob is working with Dan. Joe is working with Kai. Kai is working with Tom. Tom is working with Zac. How many densely-connected room clusters do we have in this office? A densely-connected cluster is a group of persons that are connected to themselves with a max of 2 persons."

We can represent each person as a node and draw edges between them based on their connections. A node can have edges to its immediate neighbors and the neighbors of its neighbors. \n\nAfter mapping the connections between the artists, we can identify the densely-connected clusters as follows: \n\n- Amy, Bob, Cal, Dan, Eva, Fay, and Gus form a densely-connected cluster\n- Ian, Joe, Kim, Leo, Max, Ned, and Ola form a densely-connected cluster\n- Pam, Tom, Zac, Kai, and Liv form a densely-connected cluster\n- Gia does not have any direct or indirect connections to the other clusters\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 3 clusters."
