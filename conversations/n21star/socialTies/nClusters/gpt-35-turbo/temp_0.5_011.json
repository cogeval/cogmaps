Each scholar represents a node, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nFirst, let's create a graph representation of the connections between scholars:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\nNow, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to identify the connected components in the graph. Each connected component represents a densely-connected scholar cluster.\n\nStarting with the first scholar, we can perform a DFS or BFS to explore all connected scholars. We mark each visited scholar to avoid revisiting them in subsequent iterations. Once we have explored all connected scholars for a given starting scholar, we move on to the next unvisited scholar and repeat the process until all scholars have been visited.\n\nAfter performing the DFS or BFS algorithm, we count the number of connected components or clusters we have identified. This will give us the number of densely-connected scholar clusters in the group.\n\nAnswer: there are 5 clusters"
