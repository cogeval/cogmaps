First, let's represent the connections between scholars as a graph. Each scholar will be a node, and the connections between scholars will be represented as edges.\n\n2. Next, we will identify the connected components in this graph. A connected component is a subgraph in which every node is connected to every other node in the subgraph.\n\n3. Finally, we will count the number of connected components that have at least 2 scholars.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\nStep 1: Represent the connections as a graph:\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n- Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n- Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n- Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n- Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n- Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n- Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n- Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n- Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n- Puja is connected to scholar Pari.\n- Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n- Wim is connected to Jing.\n- Pari is connected to Amy.\n- Amy is connected to Matt.\n- Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nThe graph representation of the connections is as follows:\nAmir - Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara - Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack - Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha - Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj - Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam - Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin - Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing - Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei - Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim - Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan - Puja, Pari\nGia - Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza - Wim, Jing\nPuja - Pari\nPrem - Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim - Jing\nPari - Amy\nAmy - Matt\nMatt - Eva\n\nStep 2: Identify the connected components:\nBased on the connections, we can identify the following connected components:\n- Component 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n- Component 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n- Component 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n\nStep 3: Count the number of connected components with at least 2 scholars:\nIn this case, all the connected components have at least 2 scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters"
