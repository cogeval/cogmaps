Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Each scholar can be represented as a node in the graph, and their connections can be represented as edges between the nodes.\n\nLet's start by creating a graph representation of the connections mentioned in the task:\n\n1. Create a graph with 21 nodes representing the scholars.\n2. Add edges between the nodes based on the connections mentioned in the task.\n\nAfter creating the graph, we can find the number of densely-connected scholar clusters by finding the connected components in the graph. A connected component is a subgraph in which every node is reachable from every other node.\n\nNow, let's count the number of densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\n1. Start with a counter variable set to 0.\n2. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Iterate over each node in the graph.\n4. If the node is already visited, skip to the next node.\n5. If the node is not visited:\n   - Increment the counter by 1.\n   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the current node to find all connected nodes.\n   - Mark all visited nodes in the set.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes are visited.\n\nFinally, we can provide the outcome:\n\nAnswer: there are X clusters"
