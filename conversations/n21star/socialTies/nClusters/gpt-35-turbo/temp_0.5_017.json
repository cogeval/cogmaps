            "content": "To determine the number of densely-connected scholar clusters in this group, we can use the concept of connected components in a graph. Each scholar represents a node, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nWe can start by creating an adjacency matrix to represent the connections between scholars. The matrix will have a size of 21x21, with 1s indicating connections between scholars and 0s indicating no connections.\n\nNext, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), to find the connected components in the graph. We will start from each unvisited scholar and explore all connected scholars to form a cluster. We will count the clusters that have a minimum of 2 scholars.\n\nLet's go through the steps to find the number of densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\n1. Create an adjacency matrix with size 21x21 and initialize all elements to 0.\n2. Iterate through the given connections and update the adjacency matrix accordingly.\n3. Initialize a variable `clusterCount` to 0 to keep track of the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n4. Initialize an array `visited` of size 21 to keep track of visited scholars. Set all elements to false.\n5. Iterate through each scholar. If the scholar is unvisited, perform the following steps:\n   - Increment `clusterCount` by 1.\n   - Perform a DFS or BFS starting from the current scholar to find all connected scholars within the cluster.\n   - Mark all visited scholars as true in the `visited` array.\n6. After iterating through all scholars, the value of `clusterCount` will represent the number of densely-connected scholar clusters.\n\nNow, let's count the number of densely-connected scholar clusters using the provided information.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters"
