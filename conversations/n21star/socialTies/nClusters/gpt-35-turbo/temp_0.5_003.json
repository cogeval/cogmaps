We will create a graph where each scholar is represented as a node, and the connections between scholars are represented as edges.\n\n1. Start by creating an empty graph.\n\n2. Add the scholars as nodes to the graph: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza, Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja, Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n\n3. Add the connections between scholars as edges to the graph:\n   - Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n   - Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n   - Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n   - Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n   - Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n   - Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n   - Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n   - Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n   - Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n   - Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n   - Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n   - Puja is connected to scholars Pari.\n   - Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n   - Wim is connected to Jing.\n   - Pari is connected to Amy.\n   - Amy is connected to Matt.\n   - Matt is connected to Eva.\n\n4.
