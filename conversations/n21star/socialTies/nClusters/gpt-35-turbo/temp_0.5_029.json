Create a list of clusters, where each cluster represents a group of scholars who are densely connected to each other.\n3. Iterate through each scholar and check if they are already assigned to a cluster. If not, create a new cluster and add the scholar to it.\n4. For each scholar, check their connections and add them to the cluster if they are not already in it.\n5. Repeat step 4 until no more scholars can be added to the cluster.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all remaining unassigned scholars.\n7. Count the number of clusters created.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given information:\n\n1. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza.\n2. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n4. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n6. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n7. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n8. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n9. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n10. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n11. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n12. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n13. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n14. Puja is connected to scholar Pari.\n15. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n16. Wim is connected to Jing.\n17. Pari is connected to Amy.\n18. Amy is connected to Matt.\n19. Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's determine the number of densely-connected scholar clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nCluster 2: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nCluster 3: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
