Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n4. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n5. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n6. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n7. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n8. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n9.
