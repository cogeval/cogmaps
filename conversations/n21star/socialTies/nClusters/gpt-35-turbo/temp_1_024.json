We can represent the scholars as nodes and their connections as edges in a graph. \n\nBased on the given information, we can construct the following graph:\n\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\nSara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nZack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\nNisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\nRaj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nMing -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\nWei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Pari\nGia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\nReza -> Wim, Jing\nPuja -> Pari\nPrem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\nWim -> Jing\nPari -> Amy\nAmy -> Matt\nMatt -> Eva\n\nNow we can identify the clusters by performing a depth-first search algorithm. Each time we start a new search, we count it as a new cluster. \n\nLet's walk through the graph and count the clusters:\n\n1. Start at Amir: Amir -> Wim -> Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Nisha -> Reza (Cluster 1)\n\n2. Start at Sara: Sara -> Pari -> Amy -> Matt -> Eva -> Ming -> Prem (Cluster 2)\n\n3. Start at Zack: Zack -> Gia (Cluster 3)\n\n4. Start at Pam: Pam -> Puja -> Ian -> Kim -> Moin (Cluster 4)\n\n5. Start at Puja: Already visited in Cluster 4.\n\n6. Start at Moin: Already visited in Cluster 4.\n\n7. Start at Ming: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\n8. Start at Wei: Already visited in Cluster 1.\n\n9. Start at Kim: Already visited in Cluster 4.\n\n10. Start at Ian: Already visited in Cluster 4.\n\n11. Start at Gia: Already visited in Cluster 3.\n\n12. Start at Reza: Already visited in Cluster 1.\n\n13. Start at Prem: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\n14. Start at Wim: Already visited in Cluster 1.\n\n15. Start at Pari: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\n16. Start at Amy: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\n17. Start at Matt: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\n18. Start at Eva: Already visited in Cluster 2.\n\nSince we have covered all scholars in the group, we have identified 4 densely-connected scholar clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 4 clusters."
