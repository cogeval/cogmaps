Each scholar represents a node in the graph, and the connections between scholars represent edges.\n\nBased on the given information, we can create the following connections:\n\n1. Amir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n2. Sara -> Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n3. Zack -> Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem\n4. Nisha -> Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei\n5. Raj -> Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n6. Pam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\n7. Moin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\n8. Ming -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia\n9. Wei -> Reza, Wim, Eva\n10. Kim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\n11. Ian -> Puja, Pari\n12. Gia -> Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy\n13. Reza -> Wim, Jing\n14. Puja -> Pari\n15. Prem -> Matt, Eva, Amy\n16. Wim -> Jing\n17. Pari -> Amy\n18. Amy -> Matt\n19. Matt -> Eva\n\nNow, let's identify the densely-connected scholar clusters using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:\n\n1. Starting with Amir, we can traverse the graph and identify the following cluster: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n2. Starting with Sara, we can traverse the graph and identify the following cluster: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja.\n3. Starting with Zack, we can traverse the graph and identify the following cluster: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
