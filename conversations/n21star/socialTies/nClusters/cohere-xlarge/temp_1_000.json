We, the people who work in the same room, know each other better than those in other room. And that makes better communication and easier team collaboration.\nA bus trip to GSuSI 2020 has finished. The last event was held by Takehiko Muda and Teruki Takajo. It was about A.I. development in Japan. The story was simple. Takehiko Muda talked about his path in his carrier. Teruki Takajo worked for management of a company's AI department. He described market demand for the developers. Moreover, he talked about what is like to be a project manager.\nAt the end of the day, participants summarized their impressions.
