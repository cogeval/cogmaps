Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

We start by identifying each scholar's connections:\n\n1. Amir's cluster includes: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\n2. Sara's cluster includes: Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja.\n3. Zack's cluster includes: Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem.\n4. Nisha's cluster includes: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei.\n5. Raj's cluster includes: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim.\n6. Pam's cluster includes: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja.\n7. Moin's cluster includes: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian.\n8. Ming's cluster includes: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia.\n9. Wei's cluster includes: Reza, Wim, Eva.\n10. Kim's cluster includes: Ian, Puja, Pari.\n11. Ian's cluster includes: Puja, Pari.\n12. Gia's cluster includes: Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy.\n13. Reza's cluster includes: Wim, Jing.\n14. Puja's cluster includes: Pari.\n15. Prem's cluster includes: Matt, Eva, Amy.\n16. Wim's cluster includes: Jing.\n17. Pari's cluster includes: Amy.\n18. Amy's cluster includes: Matt.\n19. Matt's cluster includes: Eva.\n20. The 21st scholar was not mentioned to have any connections.\n\nComparing these groups we can identify duplicates or subsets within the main clusters:\n\n1. Amir's cluster is repeated in Nisha's cluster.\n2. Sara's cluster is repeated in Pam's and Moin's clusters.\n3. Zack's cluster is repeated in Ming's and Gia's clusters.\n4. Raj's and Wei's clusters are subsets of Amir's cluster.\n5. Kim's and Ian's clusters are subsets of Sara's cluster.\n6. Prem's cluster is a subset of Zack's cluster.\n7. Reza's, Puja's, Wim's, Pari's, Amy's, Matt's clusters are all single connections or no connections.\n\nIn conclusion, the original three clusters (Amir's, Sara's, Zack's) cover all densely-connected groups. Therefore, \n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
