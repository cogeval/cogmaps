Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

These scholars are all connected to each other.\n\n2. The second cluster includes Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. These scholars are all interconnected.\n\n3. The third cluster includes Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. These scholars are all connected to each other.\n\nIt's important to note that some scholars are connected to scholars in other clusters, but this does not make them part of that cluster. For example, Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, but Eva is not connected to the other scholars in Wei's cluster. Therefore, Wei and Eva belong to separate clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
