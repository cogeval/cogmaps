Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei, but these connections are already part of Amir's cluster.\n\n5. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, but these connections are already part of Amir's cluster.\n\n6. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja, but these connections are already part of Sara's cluster.\n\n7. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian, but these connections are already part of Sara's cluster.\n\n8. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia, but these connections are already part of Zack's cluster.\n\n9. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva, but these connections are already part of Amir's cluster and Zack's cluster.\n\n10. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari, but these connections are already part of Sara's cluster.\n\n11. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari, but these connections are already part of Sara's cluster.\n\n12.
