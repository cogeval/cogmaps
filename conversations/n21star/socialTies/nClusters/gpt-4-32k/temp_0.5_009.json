Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

These are groups of scholars that are all connected to each other.\n\nStep 1: Identify the unique connections for each scholar.\n\nStep 2: Group the scholars that are connected to each other.\n\nAmir's cluster: Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\nSara's cluster: Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja.\nZack's cluster: Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, Prem.\n\nStep 3: Check if there are overlaps between the clusters.\n\nThere seems to be no overlap between Amir's, Sara's, and Zack's clusters. Each scholar mentioned in these clusters is unique to their respective cluster.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of clusters.\n\nWe have three clusters: Amir's, Sara's, and Zack's.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
