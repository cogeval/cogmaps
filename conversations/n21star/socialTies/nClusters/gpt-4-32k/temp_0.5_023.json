Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Start with the first scholar, Amir, who is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. This forms the first cluster.\n\n2. Move to the next scholar, Sara, who is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. This forms the second cluster.\n\n3. Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. This forms the third cluster.\n\n4. Nisha is already in the first cluster with Amir, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n5. Raj is already in the first cluster with Amir, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n6. Pam is in the second cluster with Sara, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n7. Moin is in the second cluster with Sara, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n8. Ming is in the third cluster with Zack, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n9. Wei is in the first cluster with Amir, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n10. Kim is in the second cluster with Sara, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n11. Ian is in the second cluster with Sara, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n12. Gia is in the third cluster with Zack, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n13. Reza is in the first cluster with Amir, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n14. Puja is in the second cluster with Sara, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n15. Prem is in the third cluster with Zack, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n16. Wim is in the first cluster with Amir, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n17. Pari is in the second cluster with Sara, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n18. Amy is in the third cluster with Zack, and her connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n19. Matt is in the third cluster with Zack, and his connections do not form a new cluster.\n\n20.
