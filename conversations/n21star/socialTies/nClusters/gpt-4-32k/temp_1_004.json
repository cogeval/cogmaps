Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n3. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n4. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n5. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing.\n6. Wim is connected to Jing.\n\nFrom these connections, we can form the first cluster of scholars including Amir, Nisha, Raj, Wei, Reza, Wim, Jing.\n\n1. Sara is connected to Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n2. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n4. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n5. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n6. Puja is connected to scholars Pari.\n\nFrom these connections, we can form the second cluster of scholars including Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n\n1. Zack is connected to Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n2. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia.\n3. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n4. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n5. Amy is connected to Matt.\n6. Matt is connected to Eva.\n\nFrom these connections, we can form the third cluster of scholars including Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem.\n\nHence, there are three densely connected clusters of scholars.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
