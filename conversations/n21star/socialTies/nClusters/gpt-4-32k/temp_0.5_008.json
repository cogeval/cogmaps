Amir's group includes Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Nisha and Raj are also connected to Reza, Wim, Jing, and Wei. Wei is connected to Reza and Wim. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing. This forms a densely-connected cluster.\n\n2. Sara's group includes Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Puja is connected to Pari. This forms another densely-connected cluster.\n\n3. Zack's group includes Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem. Ming is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, Amy, and Gia. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva.
