Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Puja is connected to scholars Pari. Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. How many densely-connected scholar clusters do we have in this group? A densely-connected cluster is a group of scholars that are connected to themselves with a minimum of 2 scholars."

Amir, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza form a cluster because they are all connected to each other.\n\n2. Sara, Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja form another cluster as they are all interconnected.\n\n3. Zack, Matt, Eva, Amy, Gia, Ming, and Prem form the third cluster as they are all linked.\n\n4. Wei and Eva are also connected but they are already included in the first and third clusters respectively.\n\n5. Kim, Ian, and Puja form a cluster but they are already included in the second cluster.\n\n6. Gia, Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy form a cluster but they are already included in the third cluster.\n\n7. Reza, Wim, and Jing form a cluster but they are already included in the first cluster.\n\n8. Puja and Pari form a cluster but they are already included in the second cluster.\n\n9. Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy form a cluster but they are already included in the third cluster.\n\n10. Wim and Jing form a cluster but they are already included in the first cluster.\n\n11. Pari and Amy form a cluster but Amy is already included in the third cluster and Pari in the second cluster.\n\n12. Amy and Matt form a cluster but they are already included in the third cluster.\n\n13. Matt and Eva form a cluster but they are already included in the third cluster.\n\nSo, we can see that there are three distinct densely-connected clusters.\n\nAnswer: there are 3 clusters."
