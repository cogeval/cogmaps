If yes, the shortest path is just Pam and Reza.\n3. If Pam is not directly connected to Reza, check Pam's connections (Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja).\n4. Check if any of Pam's connections are directly connected to Reza. If yes, the shortest path is Pam, the connection, and Reza.\n5. If none of Pam's connections are directly connected to Reza, check the connections of Pam's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until Reza is found or all connections are exhausted.\n\nBased on the given connections, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Pam is not directly connected to Reza.\n3. Check Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n4. None of Pam's connections are directly connected to Reza.\n5. Check the connections of Pam's connections:\n   - Jing is connected to Wei, Raj, Nisha, and Reza. Reza is directly connected to Reza.\n   - Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Pari is not directly connected to Reza.\n   - Ian is connected to Puja and Pari. Pari is not directly connected to Reza.\n   - Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian. Pari is not directly connected to Reza.\n   - Puja is directly connected to Reza.\n6. The shortest path from Pam to Reza is Pam, Jing, Reza.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Reza"
