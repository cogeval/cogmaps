Here is the graph representation:\n\nPam -> Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nJing -> Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim, Pam\nKim -> Ian, Puja, Pari\nIan -> Puja, Kim, Moin\nMoin -> Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian\nPuja -> Pari, Kim, Ian, Moin\nWei -> Reza, Raj, Wim, Jing\nRaj -> Wei, Jing, Wim, Reza\nReza -> Wim, Wei, Raj, Jing\nWim -> Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza\nPari -> Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja\nAmir -> Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from Pam, we will explore each scholar's connections until we reach Amir. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Check Pam's connections: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja.\n3. Check Jing's connections: Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim, Pam. (Note: We skip Pam since we have already visited her.)\n4. Check Wei's connections: Reza, Raj, Wim, Jing. (Note: We skip Jing since we have already visited him.)\n5. Check Reza's connections: Wim, Wei, Raj, Jing. (Note: We skip Wei and Jing since we have already visited them.)\n6. Check Wim's connections: Jing, Raj, Wei, Reza. (Note: We skip Jing, Wei, and Reza since we have already visited them.)\n7. Check Raj's connections: Wei, Jing, Wim, Reza. (Note: We skip Wei, Jing, and Reza since we have already visited them.)\n8. Check Puja's connections: Pari, Kim, Ian, Moin. (Note: We skip Kim, Ian, and Moin since we have already visited them.)\n9. Check Pari's connections: Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja. (Note: We skip Kim, Ian, and Moin since we have already visited them.)\n10. Check Kim's connections: Ian, Puja, Pari. (Note: We skip Ian, Puja, and Pari since we have already visited them.)\n11. Check Ian's connections: Puja, Kim, Moin. (Note: We skip Puja, Kim, and Moin since we have already visited them.)\n12. Check Moin's connections: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian. (Note: We skip Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian since we have already visited them.)\n13. Check Nisha's connections: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei. (Note: We skip Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei since we have already visited them.)\n14. Check Amir's connections: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza. (Note: We skip Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza since we have already visited them.)\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Pam to Amir is: Pam, Jing, Wei, Raj, Amir.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Jing, Wei, Raj, Amir"
