Check if Nisha is connected to Eva directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Eva.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections (Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei).\n4. Add Nisha's connections to the queue in the order they were mentioned (Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei).\n5. Remove Nisha from the queue.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until Eva is found or the queue is empty.\n\nUsing the BFS algorithm, we can find the shortest path from Nisha to Eva as follows:\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Reza, Wim, Eva"
