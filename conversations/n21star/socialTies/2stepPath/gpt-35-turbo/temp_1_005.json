Starting from Raj, we will explore the connections of each scholar, one level at a time, until we reach Eva.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Eva:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and an empty visited list.\n2. Enqueue Raj into the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   b. If the scholar is Eva, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   c. If the scholar has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue all their connected scholars.\n4. If the queue becomes empty and Eva has not been found, there is no path from Raj to Eva.\n\nNow let's follow these steps to find the shortest path from Raj to Eva:\n\nStep 1: Enqueue Raj\nQueue: Raj\nVisited: Raj\n\nStep 2: Dequeue Raj\nQueue: \nVisited: Raj\n\nStep 3: Enqueue Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim (connected to Raj)\nQueue: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 4: Dequeue Jing\nQueue: Wei, Reza, Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 5: Enqueue Wei, Reza, and Wim (connected to Jing)\nQueue: Wei, Reza, Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 6: Dequeue Wei\nQueue: Reza, Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 7: Enqueue Reza and Wim (connected to Wei)\nQueue: Reza, Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 8: Dequeue Reza\nQueue: Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 9: Enqueue Wim (connected to Reza)\nQueue: Wim\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 10: Dequeue Wim\nQueue: \nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 11: Enqueue Eva (connected to Wim)\nQueue: Eva\nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim\n\nStep 12: Dequeue Eva\nQueue: \nVisited: Raj, Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva\n\nSince we have found Eva, the shortest path from Raj to Eva is: Raj, Wim, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Raj, Wim, Eva"
