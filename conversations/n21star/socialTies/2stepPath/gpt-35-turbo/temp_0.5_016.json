Check if Wei is connected to Prem directly. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, Prem.\n3. If not, check all the scholars connected to Wei (Reza, Wim, and Eva).\n4. Check if any of these scholars are connected to Prem. If yes, the shortest path is Wei, the connecting scholar, Prem.\n5. If not, check all the scholars connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n6. Repeat the process until Prem is found or all the scholars have been checked.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Wei to Prem is:\nWei, Eva, Prem.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Prem"
