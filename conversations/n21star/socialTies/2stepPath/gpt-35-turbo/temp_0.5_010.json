Start with Jing.\n2. Check the scholars connected to Jing: Wei, Raj, Reza, Wim, and Pam.\n3. Since Puja is not directly connected to Jing, we need to explore further.\n4. Move to Wei.\n5. Check the scholars connected to Wei: Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n6. Since Puja is not connected to Wei, we continue exploring.\n7. Move to Raj.\n8. Check the scholars connected to Raj: Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n9. Since Puja is not connected to Raj, we continue exploring.\n10. Move to Reza.\n11. Check the scholars connected to Reza: Wim and Jing.\n12. Since Puja is not connected to Reza, we continue exploring.\n13. Move to Wim.\n14. Check the scholars connected to Wim: Jing.\n15.
