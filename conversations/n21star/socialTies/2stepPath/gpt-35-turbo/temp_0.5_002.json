Start with Wim as the initial node.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create a visited set and add Wim to it.\n4. Create a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each scholar.\n5. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued scholar is Pam, break the loop.\n   - For each scholar connected to the dequeued scholar that is not in the visited set, do the following:\n     - Enqueue the connected scholar.\n     - Add the connected scholar to the visited set.\n     - Set the parent of the connected scholar as the dequeued scholar in the parent dictionary.\n6. If Pam is not found, there is no path from Wim to Pam.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Add Wim to the visited set.\n4. Set the parent of Wim as None.\n5. Dequeue Wim.\n   - Wim is connected to Jing, Reza, and Raj.\n   - Enqueue Jing, Reza, and Raj.\n   - Add Jing, Reza, and Raj to the visited set.\n   - Set the parent of Jing, Reza, and Raj as Wim.\n6. Dequeue Jing.\n   - Jing is connected to Wei, Wim, Reza, and Pam.\n   - Enqueue Wei, Wim, Reza, and Pam.\n   - Add Wei, Wim, Reza, and Pam to the visited set.\n   - Set the parent of Wei, Wim, Reza, and Pam as Jing.\n7. Dequeue Reza.\n   - Reza is connected to Wim, Jing, and Nisha.\n   - Wim is already visited, so we skip it.\n   - Jing is already visited, so we skip it.\n   - Nisha is not visited.\n   - Enqueue Nisha.\n   - Add Nisha to the visited set.\n   - Set the parent of Nisha as Reza.\n8. Dequeue Raj.\n   - Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n   - Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim are already visited, so we skip them.\n9. Dequeue Wei.\n   - Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n   - Reza, Wim, and Eva are already visited, so we skip them.\n10. Dequeue Reza.\n    - Reza is already visited, so we skip it.\n11. Dequeue Pam.\n    - Pam is found, so we break the loop.\n\nThe shortest path from Wim to Pam is: Wim, Jing, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Pam"
