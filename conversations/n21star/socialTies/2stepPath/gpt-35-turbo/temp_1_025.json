We will keep track of the visited scholars and their respective paths.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with Pam.\n2. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja.\n3. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n4. Add the scholars (Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja) to the queue, along with their respective paths (Pam).\n5. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Jing.\n6. Jing is connected to Wei, Reza, and Wim.\n7. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n8. Add the scholars (Wei, Reza, and Wim) to the queue, along with their respective paths (Pam, Jing).\n9. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Kim.\n10. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari.\n11. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n12. Add the scholars (Ian, Puja, and Pari) to the queue, along with their respective paths (Pam, Kim).\n13. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Ian.\n14. Ian is connected to Puja and Pari.\n15. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n16. Add the scholars (Puja and Pari) to the queue, along with their respective paths (Pam, Kim, Ian).\n17. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Moin.\n18. Moin is connected to Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian.\n19. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n20. Add the scholars (Puja, Pari, Kim, and Ian) to the queue, along with their respective paths (Pam, Moin).\n21. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Puja.\n22. Puja is connected to scholars Pari.\n23. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n24. Add the scholar (Pari) to the queue, along with their respective path (Pam, Moin, Puja).\n25. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Pari.\n26. Pari is connected to Amy.\n27. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n28. Add the scholar (Amy) to the queue, along with their respective path (Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari).\n29. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Amy.\n30. Amy is connected to Matt.\n31. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n32. Add the scholar (Matt) to the queue, along with their respective path (Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy).\n33. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Matt.\n34. Matt is connected to Eva.\n35. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n36. Add the scholar (Eva) to the queue, along with their respective path (Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt).\n37. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Eva.\n38. Eva is connected to Wei.\n39. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is not in this list, continue to the next step.\n40. Add the scholar (Wei) to the queue, along with their respective path (Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva).\n41. Take the next scholar from the queue, which is Wei.\n42. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n43. Check each scholar if they are Nisha. Since Nisha is in this list, we have found the shortest path from Pam to Nisha.\n44. The shortest path is Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, and Nisha.\n\nAnswer: Pam, Moin, Puja, Pari, Amy, Matt, Eva, Wei, Nisha"
