Mark Pam as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the front of the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pari, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the scholars connected to the current scholar (except for those that have already been visited).\n   - Mark the connected scholars as visited.\n4.
