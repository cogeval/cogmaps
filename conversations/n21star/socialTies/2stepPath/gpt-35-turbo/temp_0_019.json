Check if Nisha is connected to Eva directly. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, Eva.\n3. If not, check Nisha's connections (Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei).\n4. Check if any of Nisha's connections are directly connected to Eva. If yes, the shortest path is Nisha, [connection], Eva.\n5. If not, check the connections of Nisha's connections.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Eva is found or all connections have been checked.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei.\n2. None of Nisha's connections are directly connected to Eva.\n3. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing.\n4. Wim is directly connected to Eva.\n5. The shortest path from Nisha to Eva is Nisha, Wim, Eva.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Wim, Eva"
