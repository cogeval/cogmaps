Start at Wim.\n2. Check Wim's connections: Jing, Wei, and Eva.\n3. Since Pam is not directly connected to Wim, we will explore Wim's connections one by one.\n4. From Wim, the next connection we explore is Jing.\n5. Check Jing's connections: Wei, Raj, Reza, and Pam.\n6. Pam is found! Since we have reached Pam, we can stop the BFS algorithm and note down the path.\n7. The shortest path from Wim to Pam is: Wim, Jing, Pam.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Wim, Jing, Pam."
