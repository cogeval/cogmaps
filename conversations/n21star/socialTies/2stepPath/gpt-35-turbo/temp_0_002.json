Create an empty queue and enqueue Wim.\n3. Create an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n   - If the scholar is Pam, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - If the scholar has not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue all their connected scholars.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Pam has not been found, there is no path from Wim to Pam.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start with Wim.\n2. Enqueue Wim.\n3. Mark Wim as visited.\n4. Dequeue Wim.\n5. Enqueue Jing, Wei, and Eva (connected to Wim).\n6. Mark Jing, Wei, and Eva as visited.\n7. Dequeue Jing.\n8. Enqueue Reza (connected to Jing).\n9. Mark Reza as visited.\n10. Dequeue Wei.\n11. Enqueue Reza (connected to Wei).\n12. Mark Reza as visited.\n13. Dequeue Eva.\n14. Enqueue Matt (connected to Eva).\n15. Mark Matt as visited.\n16. Dequeue Reza.\n17. Enqueue Wim (connected to Reza).\n18. Mark Wim as visited.\n19. Dequeue Matt.\n20. Enqueue Amy (connected to Matt).\n21. Mark Amy as visited.\n22. Dequeue Wim.\n23. Enqueue Pam (connected to Wim).\n24. Mark Pam as visited.\n25. Dequeue Amy.\n26. Stop the algorithm as Pam has been found.\n\nAnswer: Wim, Jing, Wei, Eva, Reza, Matt, Pam"
