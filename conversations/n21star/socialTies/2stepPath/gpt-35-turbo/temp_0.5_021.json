Start with Reza as the initial node and create an empty queue.\n2. Add Reza to the queue.\n3. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited scholars.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the first scholar from the queue and assign it to the current_scholar variable.\n   - If the current_scholar is Eva, stop the search and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, check if the current_scholar has any connections that have not been visited yet.\n   - For each unvisited connection, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Keep track of the path from Reza to the current_scholar using a dictionary or a list.\n5. If the queue becomes empty and Eva has not been found, there is no path from Reza to Eva.\n\nUsing this algorithm, let's find the shortest path from Reza to Eva:\n\nAnswer: Reza, Wim, Eva"
