Check if Jing is connected to Puja. If yes, then the shortest path is just Jing and Puja.\n3. If Jing is not directly connected to Puja, we need to explore the connections of Jing's connections.\n4. From the given connections, we know that Jing is connected to Wei, Raj, Reza, and Wim.\n5. Check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Puja. If yes, then the shortest path is Jing, followed by the scholar connected to Puja, and finally Puja.\n6. If none of these scholars are directly connected to Puja, we need to explore their connections.\n7. From the given connections, we know that Wei is connected to Eva, Wim is connected to Amy, and Reza is connected to Wim.\n8. Check if any of these scholars are directly connected to Puja.
