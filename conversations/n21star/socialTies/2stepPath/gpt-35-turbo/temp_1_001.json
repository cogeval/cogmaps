Here are the steps I will take:\n\n1. Starting from Amir, we will keep track of the current scholar and the path taken to reach them.\n2. We will maintain a queue to store the scholars to be visited next.\n3. We will mark Amir as visited and enqueue him into the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, we will dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n5. For each scholar connected to the current scholar and not yet visited, we will enqueue them into the queue and mark them as visited.\n6. We will continue this process until we find Eva or until the queue becomes empty.\n\nBased on the given connections, the shortest path from Amir to Eva is as follows:\n\nAmir, Wim, Wei, Eva\n\nAnswer: Amir, Wim, Wei, Eva"
