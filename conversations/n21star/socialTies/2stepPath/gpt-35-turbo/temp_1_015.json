Starting from Wei, we can traverse through the connections of Wei and keep track of the visited scholars until we reach Ming. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue.\n2. Enqueue Wei.\n3. Initialize an empty visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a scholar from the queue.\n     - If the scholar is Ming, we have found the shortest path. Exit the loop.\n     - Otherwise, check if the scholar has been visited. If not, mark it as visited and enqueue all its connected scholars.\n5. If Ming is not found, there is no path from Wei to Ming.\n\nLet's go through the steps and find the shortest path from Wei to Ming:\n\nQueue: [Wei]\nVisited: []\n\n1. Dequeue Wei from the queue.\n   - Wei is not Ming.\n   - Mark Wei as visited.\n   - Enqueue Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nQueue: [Reza, Wim, Eva]\nVisited: [Wei]\n\n2. Dequeue Reza from the queue.\n   - Reza is not Ming.\n   - Mark Reza as visited.\n   - Enqueue Wim and Jing.\n\nQueue: [Wim, Eva, Wim, Jing]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza]\n\n3. Dequeue Wim from the queue.\n   - Wim is not Ming.\n   - Mark Wim as visited.\n   - Enqueue Jing.\n\nQueue: [Eva, Wim, Jing, Jing]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim]\n\n4. Dequeue Eva from the queue.\n   - Eva is not Ming.\n   - Mark Eva as visited.\n   - Enqueue Amy.\n\nQueue: [Wim, Jing, Jing, Amy]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva]\n\n5. Dequeue Wim from the queue.\n   - Wim is not Ming.\n   - Wim has already been visited. Skip.\n\nQueue: [Jing, Jing, Amy]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva]\n\n6. Dequeue Jing from the queue.\n   - Jing is not Ming.\n   - Mark Jing as visited.\n   - Enqueue Ming.\n\nQueue: [Jing, Amy, Ming]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva, Jing]\n\n7. Dequeue Jing from the queue.\n   - Jing is not Ming.\n   - Jing has already been visited. Skip.\n\nQueue: [Amy, Ming]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva, Jing]\n\n8. Dequeue Amy from the queue.\n   - Amy is not Ming.\n   - Mark Amy as visited.\n   - Enqueue Matt.\n\nQueue: [Ming, Matt]\nVisited: [Wei, Reza, Wim, Eva, Jing, Amy]\n\n9. Dequeue Ming from the queue.\n   - Ming is Ming. We have found the shortest path. Exit the loop.\n\nThe shortest path from Wei to Ming is: Wei, Jing, Ming.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Jing, Ming"
