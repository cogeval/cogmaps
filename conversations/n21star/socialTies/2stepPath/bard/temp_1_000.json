Wei is connected to Reza.\n2. Reza is connected to Jing.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is Wei, Reza, and Jing.\n\nThe regular expression `(A-Za-z ]+,\\s*)*[A-Za-z ]+` matches a string of one or more words, separated by commas. The words can be any combination of letters, numbers, and spaces.\n\nIn this case, the string that matches the regular expression is:\n\n```\nWei, Reza, Jing\n```\n\nThis string represents the shortest path from Wei to Jing."
