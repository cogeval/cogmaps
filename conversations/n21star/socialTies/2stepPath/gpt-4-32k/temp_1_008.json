Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. From Jing what is the shortest path to Ian?

Looking at each of these connections, we then find the scholars they are connected to. \n\nAmir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. No direct connection to Ian here. \nNisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. No direct connection to Ian either. \nRaj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Still no connection to Ian. \nReza is connected to Wim, and Jing. There's no connection to Ian. \nWim is connected only to Jing. \n\nIan is directly connected to Sara, Kim, and Puja. So we look for any of these three among the connections of Jing's connections. \n\nAmir, Nisha, Raj, Reza, and Wim - none of them are connected to Sara, Kim, or Puja. \n\nBut when checking the connections of Raj, we see that Raj is connected to Wei. And Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, Eva and directly to Ian. \n\nSo the shortest path from Jing to Ian would be Jing -> Raj -> Wei -> Ian.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Raj, Wei, Ian"
