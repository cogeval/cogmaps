Among these, Amy and Matt have direct connections to fewer scholars. Amy is connected to Matt and Pari, while Matt is connected to Eva. We choose Amy.\n4. Amy is connected to Matt and Pari. Pari has fewer connections.\n5. Pari is connected to Puja and Amy. Puja has more connections so we choose her.\n6. Puja is connected to Pari, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Pam. Among these, Ian and Kim have fewer connections. Ian is connected to Kim and Puja, while Kim is also connected to Ian, Pam, and Puja. We choose Ian.\n7. Ian is connected to Kim and Puja. Kim has more connections so we choose her.\n8. Kim is connected to Ian, Puja, and Pari. Pam has fewer connections so we choose her.\n9. Pam is connected to Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Jing has more connections so we choose her.\n10. Jing is connected to Amir, Raj, Wim, Wei, Pam, and Nisha.
