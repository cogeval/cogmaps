Jing is connected to Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza, and Wim. \n\nNext, we need to find out if any of these scholars are directly connected to Kim. None of them are.\n\nThen, we need to look at the second degree connections from Jing. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. Wim is connected to Jing. \n\nAmong these, Nisha is connected to Raj, and Raj is connected to Amir. Amir is not connected to Kim, so this path doesn't lead to Kim. \n\nNext, we look at the connections from Pam, since Pam is connected to Kim. Pam is connected to Sara, and Sara is connected to Kim. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Jing to Kim is Jing, Pam, Kim.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Kim"
