Identify the starting point (Wei) and the end point (Prem).\n2. Map out all the connections from Wei.\n3. Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n4. Check each of these connections to see if Prem is immediately connected to any of them.\n5. Prem is not directly connected to Reza, Wim, or Eva.\n6. Therefore, look at the next level of connections. Eva is connected to Matt, and Matt is connected to Prem.\n7. So, the shortest path from Wei to Prem goes via Eva and Matt.\n\nFinally, list the scholar names in the order they are visited on the shortest path, separated by commas.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Matt, Prem"
