According to the given information, Jing is connected to Raj, Amir, Nisha, Reza, and Wim. \n\nNext, we need to look at the connections for each of these scholars to see if any of them are directly connected to Sara. Unfortunately, none of them are directly connected to Sara.\n\nTherefore, we need to look at the second degree connections. \n\n- Raj is connected to Wei, Reza, Wim, and Jing. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Wim is connected to Jing. He is not connected to Sara.\n\nSince none of Jing's first or second degree connections are directly connected to Sara, we need to look at the third degree connections. \n\n- Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Wim is connected to Jing. He is not connected to Sara.\n- Jing is connected to Raj, Amir, Nisha, Reza, and Wim. None of these are connected to Sara.\n- Eva is connected to Matt, Gia, Prem, and Amy. None of these are connected to Sara.\n\nFinally, we find that Pam, who is connected to Sara, is also connected to Jing. Therefore, the shortest path from Jing to Sara is Jing, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Sara"
