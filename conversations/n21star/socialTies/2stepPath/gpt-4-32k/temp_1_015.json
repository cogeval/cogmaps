The scholar Ming is not directly connected to Wei, so the next step is to identify the connected scholars of Reza, Wim, and Eva to find a path to Ming.\n\nAmong these scholars, Eva is directly connected to Ming. Thus, the shortest path from Wei to Ming would involve Eva.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Wei to Ming is: Wei, Eva, Ming. \n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Ming"
