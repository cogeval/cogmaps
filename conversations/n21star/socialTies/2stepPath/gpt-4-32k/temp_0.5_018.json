However, none of them are directly connected to Pam. \n\nThen, I'll determine the second degree connections from Nisha. These include the scholars that Nisha's connections are connected to. Reza is connected to Wim and Jing, Wim is connected to Jing, Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim, Jing is not connected to anyone else, and Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva.\n\nAgain, I'll review these connections to see if any of them are directly connected to Pam. Unfortunately, none of them are directly connected to Pam either. \n\nFinally, I'll determine the third degree connections from Nisha. These include the scholars that Nisha's second degree connections are connected to. Jing is connected to Raj, Pam, Wei, and Reza. Pam is the target, so the path from Nisha to Pam is Nisha, Raj, Jing, Pam.\n\nAnswer: Nisha, Raj, Jing, Pam."
