Jing is connected to: Raj, Wim, Amir, Nisha, and Wei. Reza is not here so I'll check the next scholar.\n2. Kim is connected to: Ian, Puja, Sara, and Pari. Reza is not here so I'll check the next scholar.\n3. Ian is connected to: Puja, Kim, Sara, and Pari. Reza is not here so I'll check the next scholar.\n4. Moin is connected to: Puja, Pari, Kim, Ian, and Sara. Reza is not here so I'll check the next scholar.\n5. Puja is connected to: Pari, Sara, Kim, Ian, and Moin. Reza is not here so I'll check the next scholar.\n\nSince none of the scholars connected to Pam are connected to Reza, I'll need to go one step further.\n\nFrom the scholars connected to Jing:\n1.
