Prem is connected to Matt, Eva, and Amy. Wim is connected to Jing. Pari is connected to Amy. Amy is connected to Matt. Matt is connected to Eva. From Jing what is the shortest path to Moin?

            "content": "Firstly, starting from Jing, we need to identify all the scholars Jing is directly connected to. From the information given, Jing is connected to Amir, Nisha, Raj, Wim and Reza.\n\nNext, we find out which of these scholars are directly connected to Moin. Among the scholars Jing is connected to, none are directly connected to Moin.\n\nNow we look at one step further connections from Jing's connections. Amir is connected to Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. Raj is connected to Jing, Wei, Reza, and Wim. Wim is connected to Jing. Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. From this, we can see that none of the scholars connected to Jing are directly connected to Moin.\n\nSo we need to look at the connections one step further. Let's start with the people Amir is connected to - Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, and Reza. Out of these, Wim and Raj don't have any new connections that we haven't already explored.\n\nChecking Wei's connections, Wei is connected to Reza, Wim, and Eva. These are all connections we've already explored. Checking Nisha's connections again, Nisha is connected to Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, and Wei. These are connections we've already checked. Checking Reza's connections, Reza is connected to Wim, and Jing. These are connections we've already explored.\n\nNow let's move to the people Sara is connected to - Pari, Pam, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja. Moin is one of Sara's connections. \n\nTo get to Sara, Jing is connected to Amir, and Amir is connected to Wei. Wei is connected to Eva and Eva is connected to Zack. Zack is connected to Sara. And Sara is connected to Moin.\n\nSo the shortest path from Jing to Moin is Jing, Amir, Wei, Eva, Zack, Sara, Moin.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Amir, Wei, Eva, Zack, Sara, Moin."
