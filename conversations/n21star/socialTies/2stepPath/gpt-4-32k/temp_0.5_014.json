From Wim, we can reach Jing.\n4. From Eva, we can reach Matt, Amy, and Prem.\n5. From Matt, we can reach Eva.\n6. From Amy, we can reach Matt.\n7. From Prem, we can reach Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n8. From Jing, there are no new connections.\n9. Gia is connected to Prem, Matt, Eva, and Amy.\n\nFrom this, it appears the shortest path from Wei to Gia is through Eva. So the order of scholars is Wei, Eva, Gia.\n\nAnswer: Wei, Eva, Gia"
