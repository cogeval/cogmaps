It appears none of them are directly connected to Sara. \n\nTherefore, we must look at the next level of connections. \n\nAmir is connected to: Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei, Nisha, Reza.\nRaj is connected to: Jing, Wei, Reza, Wim.\nNisha is connected to: Reza, Wim, Raj, Jing, Wei.\nReza is connected to: Wim, Jing.\nPam is connected to: Jing, Kim, Ian, Moin, Puja. \nWim is connected to: Jing.\n\nAmong the scholars that Amir, Raj, Nisha, Reza, Pam, and Wim are connected to, Kim, Ian, Moin, and Puja are directly connected to Sara. \n\nPam is the only one who is directly connected to one of Sara's connections, therefore the shortest path from Jing to Sara will include Pam. \n\nSo the shortest path from Jing to Sara is: Jing, Pam, Sara.\n\nAnswer: Jing, Pam, Sara."
