In this scenario, the quickest path from Reza to Eva must be identified. \n\nLooking at the information given:\n\n1. Reza is directly connected to Wim and Jing. \n2. Wim is directly connected to Jing. However, Jing doesn't connect to Eva or any scholar that directly connects to Eva. Therefore, Wim does not provide a useful path.\n3. Jing also doesn't connect to Eva or any scholar that directly connects to Eva. So, Jing does not provide a useful path.\n4. Since both these paths from Reza do not lead to Eva, we need to look for connections from Reza's connections. In this case, Jing is connected to Wei.\n5. Wei is directly connected to Eva. \n\nSo, the shortest path from Reza to Eva would be: Reza -> Jing -> Wei -> Eva.\n\nAnswer: Reza, Jing, Wei, Eva."
